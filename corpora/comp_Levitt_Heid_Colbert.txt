I AM NO FAN OF BOOKS. AND CHANCES 

ARE, IF YOU’RE READING THIS, YOU 

AND I SHARE A HEALTHY SKEPTICISM 

ABOUT THE PRINTED WORD. WELL, 

I  WANT  YOU  TO  KNOW  THAT  THIS  IS  THE  FIRST  BOOK 

How many American 
Flags can you find in 
this paragraph? 

I’VE  EVER  WRITTEN,  AND  I  HOPE  IT’S  THE  FIRST  BOOK 

YOU’VE  EVER  READ.  DON’T  MAKE  A  HABIT  OF  IT. 

Now, you might ask yourself, if by yourself you mean me, “Stephen, if you don’t 

like books, why did you write one?” You just asked yourself a trick question. I 

didn’t write it. I dictated it. I shouted it into a tape recorder over the Columbus 

Day weekend, then handed it to my agent and said, “Sell this.” He’s the one 

who turned it into a book. It’s his funeral. 

But I get your “drift.” Why even dictate? 

Well, like a lot of other dictators, there is one man’s opinion I value above all 

others. Mine. And folks, I have a lot of opinions. I’m like Lucy trying to keep 

up with the candy at the chocolate factory. I can barely put them in my mouth 

fast enough. 

In fact, I have so many opinions, I have overwhelmed my ability to document 

myself. I thought my nightly broadcast, The Colbert Report (check your local

When  the  cameras  go  off,  I’m  still  talking.  And  right  now  all  that  opinion  is 

going to waste, like seed on barren ground. Well no more. It’s time to impreg-

nate this country with my mind.

See,  at  one  time  America  was  pure.  Men  were  men,  women  were  women, 

and gays were “confirmed bachelors.” But somewhere around the late 60’s, it 

became “groovy” to “let it all hang out” while you “kept on truckin’” stopping 

only to “give a hoot.” And today, Lady Liberty is under attack from the cable 

channels,  the  internet  blogs,  and  the  Hollywood  celebritocracy,  out  there 

spewing  “facts”  like  so  many  locusts  descending  on  America’s  crop  of  ripe, 

tender values. And as any farmer or biblical scholar will tell you, locusts are 

damn hard to get rid of.2 

I  said  on  the  very  first  episode  of  The  Colbert  Report  that,  together,  I  was 

going to change the world, and I’ve kept up my end of the bargain. But it’s not 

changing fast enough. Last time I checked my supermarket still sold yogurt.

comes  in.  It’s  not  just  some  collection  of  reasoned  arguments  supported  by 

facts. That’s the coward’s way out.

Okay, now it’s my turn to ask a question: What do I want from you? 

Good question. 

Thank you 

Just because I haven’t put a lot of thought into this book doesn’t mean you 

shouldn’t. I want you to read this book carefully. Savor my ideas. Memorize 

pertinent passages. Eat with it, sleep with it, let nature take its course. 

Because what I have dictated is nothing less than a Constitution for the Colbert 

Nation. And, like our Founding Fathers, I hold my Truths to be self-evident, 

which is why I did absolutely no research. 

I didn’t need to. The only research I needed was a long hard look in the mirror. 

For this book is My Story and, as such, it is the American Story. 

I  am  reminded  of  the  words  of  Walt  Whitman,  the  nineteenth-century  poet, 

naturalist, and all around man’s man, who, through his epic lyricism, defined

the character of this new nation. He said, 

“I celebrate myself, and sing myself, 

And what I assume, you shall assume.” 

That “I” he was talking about? It’s me. 

Bottom line: Read this book. Be me.

MY AMERICAN CHILDHOOD 

My earliest memory is from when I was three years old. My mother came into 
my room—I can still smell the perfume she was wearing, which I assume they 
don’t  make  anymore,  because  I’ve  spent  a  lot  of  time  in  department  stores 
looking for it. She swooped me up and told me that she and my father were 
leaving me. 

Then  she  carried  me  to  the  living  room  to  meet  Ruth.  I  was  not  entirely 
clear on what a “babysitter” was, so I naturally assumed this old woman was 
going to replace my parents forever. I was not on board with this plan. 

I may have been only three years old, but I already knew that a family was 
a mother, a father, the kids and the pets—there was no room in that model for 
an ancient crone wearing slacks and (in my opinion) too many rings. 

The  minute  my  parents  left,  I  ordered  my  stuffed  animals  to  attack.  No 
response. I threw them down the laundry chute and tried my luck with a real 
animal: our cat, Cleopatra. I carried her to my Emergency Bunker—the linen 
closet  behind  the  vacuum  cleaner.  From  there  we  could  lead  the  resistance 
against this new Ruth Regime. 

That’s when the enemy struck. Ruth was making fish sticks. I held Cleopatra 

close, but she scratched my face and dashed for the kitchen. 

Desperate, I started praying—mostly to God, although it’s possible a prayer 
to Santa may have snuck in there. I prayed He would bring my parents home 
and make our family whole again. 

And when I woke up the next morning, not only had God gotten rid of Ruth 
and brought back my parents, but He had also moved me from the linen closet 
to my own bed. 

Now that’s service. 
Why do I share this memory? Because it perfectly captures the Five Fs of 
childhood: Family, Faith, Furry Friends, and Fear of the Elderly. These are the 
fundamental relationships that teach us Where We Belong, What Belongs to Us, 
and Who We Belong to. 

My second memory is when we went to the zoo, and I saw two rhinos do it.

ARE AT WAR. AND I’M NOT TALKING 

ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ, THE WAR

DRUGS. I’M TALKING ABOUT A WAR 

WITH HIGHER STAKES THAN ALL OF THOSE OTHER WARS 

COMBINED AND THEN DIVIDED BY THREE. THE BATTLE-

GROUND  I’M  TALKING  ABOUT?  THE  AMERICAN  FAMILY. 

Think of America as a body. But not in the obvious way where Lake Michigan 

is the eye, Maine is the upturned nose, Texas is the Adam’s Apple, and Florida 

is a really pointy beard. Instead, let’s look deeper, at the biological building 

block of America: the family. 

COLB-QUIZ: What is a family? 

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a family is defined as two or more people 

living together who are related by birth, marriage or adoption. In other words, 

the U.S. Census Bureau is run by radical leftists. Why do you think there’s a 

whole category for the unemployed? 

If you ask me, from time immemorial, the word “family” has meant only one 

thing:  a  Mom  married  to  a  Pop  and  raising  2.3  rambunctious  little  scamps. 

That’s what’s called The Nuclear Family. It got that name because it reached

its peak during the early years of the Cold War, when Americans were in imme-

diate danger of nuclear annihilation. Back then, family members knew their 

roles,  and  nobody  questioned  paternal  authority.  After  all,  Dad  was  the  one 

with the keys to the fallout shelter. 

And it makes 
your hair fall out. 

What  makes  The  Nuclear  Family  so  special?  Well,  just  like  a  real  nuclear 

isotope, it’s incredibly stable. Plus, it’s a convenient shorthand for referring to 

a group of individuals. Think how much time it would take if we had to name 

each individual instead of simply saying “The Johnsons.” That’s time we could 

be spending with our families.1 

WHAT ABOUT NON-TRADITIONAL FAMILIES? 

1. Single Parent Family 

2. Manson Family 

3. Sly and the Family Stone 

Take your pick. 

THAT SOUNDS WONDERFUL: But how do you create a nuclear family of 

your own? It starts with a simple formula: 

MAN + WOMAN = MARRIAGE 

Now, just because that formula is full of letters doesn’t mean it contains vari-

ables. Change it a little and the formula doesn’t work at all. 

MAN + WOMAN ≠ MARRIAGE 

WO + MAN + WOMAN ≠ MARRIAGE 

HU + MAN + WOMAN + ATEE ≠ MARRIAGE

satisfying my lady, I like to think of myself as the dog or the boot, depending 

on my mood. 

THE FATHER 

NOW  WHAT? Now that you’ve produced children, it’s your job to socialize 

them. That means you’ve got a role to play—a role you auditioned for in the 

sack. The minute that baby pops out, you’ve got the part. And if you play it 

right, just like De Niro, you’re going to gain a lot of weight. 

America used to live by the motto “Father Knows Best.” Now we’re lucky if 

“Father  Knows  He  Has  Children.”  We’ve  become  a  nation  of  sperm  donors 

and baby daddies. But there’s more to being a father than taking kids to Chuck 

E. Cheese and supplying the occasional Y-chromosome. A father has to be a 

provider,  a  teacher,  a  role  model,  but  most  importantly,  a  distant  authority 

figure  who  can  never  be  pleased.  Otherwise,  how  will  children  ever  under-

stand the concept of God? 

Every organization needs strong leadership. At home my word is law.2 Whatever 

I  say  goes.  For  instance,  recently  my  son  wanted  a  laptop  computer  for  his 

birthday. I said, “Go ask your mother.” And he did. That’s respect. 

Know how to delegate.

and your family. 

A father should also work. A lot. Anything less than 100 hours a week and the 

kids are going to get to know Dad and, like the old saying goes, “Familiarity 

breeds contempt.” 

And sure, it’s nice to have a second income to buy the little extras like vacations 

or a place to live, but the mother should never be the primary wage earner. The 

kids  see  that,  lose  respect  for  their  father,  and  decide  to  become  gay  every 

time. It’s known as teenage rebellion, and I’ve seen parades full of it.

Finally, Dad’s got to protect the weaker minds of his wife and offspring from 

the burden of worry. He can’t show any sign of indecision, financial trouble, or 

even sickness. That’s why it is imperative that fathers never go to the doctor. 

They might find out something is wrong—knowledge which they could never 

share.4  The  crushing  burden  of  stuffing  emotion  for  decades  is  our  nation’s 

number one killer of dads. Or it should be. 

So Dad’s got a pretty tough job. That’s why he needs to be treated right. Don’t 

bother  him  when  he  walks  in  the  door.  Let  him  make  that  martini  or  leaf

THE MOTHER 

Don’t get me wrong. Being a mom is no picnic. Raising the kids is the mother’s 

responsibility. It’s a thankless, solitary job, like sheriff or Pope. 

On the plus side, they do 
get to wear cool hats. 

The mother-child bond is a fragile thing. That’s why I didn’t let my mom out 

of my sight until two years after I married. But while time apart is hard on the 

kids, it’s devastating for Mom. There’s something I call “The Maternal Instinct.” 

It’s a natural part of every female from the paramecium all the way up to our 

female human woman.6 Females need to nurture constantly, so they hate any 

time  alone  where  they  are  left  to  think,  shower,  or  sleep.  For  a  Mom  to  be 

happy,  every  moment  away  from  her  children  must  be  filled  with  the  soul-

wrenching thought, “Am I a bad mother?” 

The answer to that question is a resounding “Yes.” Scientists have proven, one 

assumes, that every flaw in a child can be traced back to a mistake made by the 

mother. As adults we’re all imperfect, so that means all mothers are incompe-

aide, if you work outside the home, you might as well bring coconut arsenic 

squares to the school bake sale. 

A mother needs to be in the home even when the kids aren’t. A messy house 

sends a coded message to children: “I’m not loveable. Otherwise Mom would 

dust.” 7 

Messy houses drive boys 
into the arms of bald 
musclemen with earrings. 

A good mother cooks, cleans, drives, organizes charity events so her children 

earn  community  service  points  for  college,  and  expects  nothing  in  return 

except love and breakfast in bed one day a year. 

So,  a  word  to  all  you  Femin-Idi-Amins:  Stop  “liberating”  moms  by  trying  to 

make  them  join  the  workforce. They’re  already  doing  the  job  that  God  put 

them here to do: Everything.8

PERSONAL  RECOLLECTION:  It  doesn’t  matter  how  my  parents  raised 

me, because I loved my parents. It’s in the Bible: “Honor thy Mother and 

thy  Father.”  It’s  right  after  the  part  about  stoning  gays.  Sure,  they  could

repressed. The truth is, I wouldn’t be the man I am today if it wasn’t for the 

way my parents raised me. And I love the man I am today—which means 

I  love  the  way  my  parents  raised  me.  And  even  if  they  made  mistakes,  I 

don’t  blame  them  for  it,  because  they  tried  their  hardest.  You  can’t  spell

tant thing is that the mistakes you make with your kids are the same ones

your parents made with you. At least you know how those turn out. 

So now that Mom and Dad know their roles, what’s next? 

RAISING A FAMILY 

Childrearing is arguably the most important of my core values. I believe in it, I 

practice it, and I ceaselessly promote it to my friends and followers. That said, 

generally speaking, I’m against children. 

What’s the matter? Did I shake you up? 

See, I’m not against the conception of children; like I said, they’re the only permis-

sible reason for intercourse. And I’m not against pregnancy—in fact, if you ask 

me,  there’s  nothing  more  beautiful  than  a  third-trimester  mother-to-be  in  full

maternity regalia. Maybe it’s the elastic, I don’t know. But the effect is stunning. 

Check carefully.  
If it’s one of 
those Cocoons, 
you’re in luck. 

No, my problem is the children themselves. They may be cute, but they are here 

to replace us. Need proof? Ever catch one walking around in your shoes? That’s 

a chilling moment, like finding an empty body snatcher pod in the basement. 

“But  children  are  our  future!”  Yes,  but  does  that  not  also  mean  that  we  are 

their  past?  I  don’t  understand  why  we’re  helping  them.  You  don’t  see  union 

factory workers throwing a benefit for robots. 

I’m sure some of you are thinking, “Why take childrearing advice from someone 

who mistrusts children?” The answer is simple. I respect my opponents. And I 

urge you all to do the same. I wish I could come to each of your houses to help

you raise your kids, but I’ve got my hands full with my own children, as well as 

several pending “negligent Big Brother” lawsuits.10 Instead, I offer these simple 

child raising tips. 

TIP NO. 1: SET SOME RULES 

Don’t  worry  if  a  rule  makes  sense—the  important  thing  is  that  it’s  a  rule. 

Arbitrary rules teach kids discipline: If every rule made sense, they wouldn’t 

be learning respect for authority, they’d be learning logic. 

So go crazy with the rules—the time your child spends trying to figure them 

out is time he won’t be stapling firecrackers to the neighbor’s dog. 

Suggested Arbitrary Rules: 

•  Wash your hands before talking to strangers. 

If you look at a cat and it sneezes, no dessert for a week. 

Jell-O must never be jiggled. 

• 

• 

• 

“Red” means “stop,” “green” means “go,” “purple” means “Wednesday.” 

And  if  they  ever  call  “bullshit”  on  your  game,  there’s  an  added  benefit 

there, too. Let me tell you a little story. Once, there was a child whose father 

had lots of rules he thought were unfair. What’s more, the strict father was never 

around, but continued making even more unreasonable demands on the child. 

Finally, the child had had enough—he rebelled, and lived happily ever after. 

Once again, Mr. and 
Mrs. McAllister, I am 
very sorry. 

That child’s name? America. 

TIP NO. 2: THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE  

No matter how many kids you have, you need to pick a favorite. It’s going to 

happen on its own, but it’ll happen faster if you and your spouse have at least 

debated the issue. The important thing is to not tell any of your kids who the 

favorite is—just let them know you have one. That’s a guessing game that will 

keep them occupied and quiet on many a road trip! 

TIP NO. 3: THEY CAN SMELL FEAR 

Never  show  weakness  in  front  of  your  kid.  This  means  never  letting 

them  see  you  cry.  If  you  absolutely  must  cry,  run  into  your  room

kid you were so angry you had to take a shower to cool down, and then deduct 

the cost of the hot water from his allowance. 

TIP NO. 4: DON’T CRY OVER SPILLED MILK 

Unspill it. If you ever wanted to travel back in time to relive your childhood, 

now  you  can—by  living  it  through  your  kid’s  childhood.  Children  are  tiny 

versions  of  you,  minus  the  crushing  failure.  If  you’re  not  going  to  live  your

doesn’t that mean, in some small way, that you yourself succeeded? And if they 

fail, well, then your dream was probably impossible in the first place—though 

your child may want to throw his kids at it, just to make sure. 

THE EXTENDED FAMILY 

Back in the olden days, the family was more than just Ma and Pa and the little 

’uns. There were Ma and Pa’s brothers and sisters and their kids and so on. It 

made for a tight cohesive group that could support each other in hard times. 

Plus,  with  such  close  family  ties,  there  was  always  someone  to  take  up  the 

blood feud if you were gunned down at the feed store. 

But today, too few people live in an extended family. So for my young friends 

reading this at a family reunion and wondering who those people are pinching 

your cheek and breathing onion dip into your face, here’s a crib sheet that 

can help. 

GRANDPARENTS  

Your parents’ parents.  
PRO: Unlike your parents, they have no issue with buying  
your love. 
CON: They grew up in the Depression, and they have never  
adjusted for inflation.  

 

GRANDPARENT SUBCATEGORY: GRANDFATHER 

PRO: He will let you play with his pocket knife and, if you’re  
really lucky, his Luger.  
CON: He will also let you play with his teeth. 

12 

T H E   F  A M I L  Y  

GRANDPARENT SUBCATEGORY: GRANDMOTHER 

PRO: Any food she serves will be full of sugar and fat and 

taste great. 

CON: She has an accent, Grandpa brought her back from the 

War, and she might be a Nazi. Dad said, “Don’t ask.” 

Ask to see her 
collection of 
stolen art! 

AUNTS AND UNCLES 

Your parents’ brothers and sisters.  
PRO: They have a hilarious childhood story about how Mom  
got that scar.  
CON: They are under the impression you should still be  
excited to see them even after they stop bringing presents. 

FAMILY FUN: Your Mom and Her Sister  Is your mom the one who “got 

the  looks”  or  the  one  who  “got  the  brains”?  Either  way,  she  resents  her 

sister for getting the other one! 

FAMILY FUN: Your Dad and His Brother Your bachelor uncle may seem 

like a “cool guy” because he has a boat and a flat-screen TV, and all your dad 

has is you kids. But hang on: In fifty years your uncle won’t have anyone 

to care for him, while your father will be a huge burden on you and your 

family! 

FIRST COUSINS 

Unless you have 
a sister. 

The children of your parents’ brothers and sisters; you 

share grandparents. 

PRO: If you need a kidney, they’ll be a marginally better 

match than someone off the street. 

CON: They may be frauds, posing as your cousins to get 

your kidney. 

KEEP IN MIND: You’ll be competing with these cousins for 

your grandparents’ estate. Start planting false evidence of 

their disloyalty now. 

13 

I   A M   A M E R I C A   ( A N D   S O   C A N   Y O U ! )  

SECOND COUSINS 

You share great-grandparents. 

PRO: Their genes are different enough that you can marry 

them without your kids looking like The Hills Have Eyes. 

CON: You can’t find anyone to marry besides your cousin? 

(See Sex and Dating) 

FDR’s excuse was 
polio. What’s yours? 

FIFTIETH COUSINS 

Many geneticists believe that every human on earth is at least  
fiftieth cousin to every other.  
PRO: There’ll be someone to move in with when Social  
Security goes bankrupt.  
CON: You are always at a family reunion.  

FUN  FACT:  Did you know there’s such a thing as “double first cousins”? 

If your dad and his brother married a pair of sisters, then your aunt and 

uncle’s children are your double first cousins! If they’re attached by a fleshy 

band and share major organs, they’re your double first conjoined cousins! 

Or as Tammy Wynette spelled it, “Divorce.” 

Divorce  is  marital  welfare.  It’s  just  couples  asking  society  to  bail  them  out 

because they didn’t do enough research before they got married. How is that 

our fault? Don’t drag down my country’s statistics just because you ran off and 

Mojitos are not a 
shared value! 

got hitched before you ever saw each other in a bad mood. 

These are not valid reasons for divorce: 

Didn’t realize you had to be monogamous. 

Time period covered by pre-nup expired. 

Your married name is something like “Anita Hardcock.” 

Girl you had a crush on in high school just got divorced. 

It’s true!

PROBLEM  IS:  More  and  more  young  Americans  are  reaching  their  prime 

child-bearing years and making statements like, “Oh, I don’t believe in marriage. 

My parents’ divorce was so terrible that I don’t want to go through the same 

thing.” The next thing you know, they’re either single parents or just single—a 

drain on society either way. 

Our bad example is ruining marriage for our children. That is why, for their 

sake, all American couples must at least fake happiness until their children are 

married. If it will help you through your misery, think of yourselves as magi-

cians, performing a deftly crafted illusion for more than 20 years. 

One way or another, you’ve got to work things out. Do not get a divorce. It’s 

bad for society, it’s in direct opposition to God’s will, and it makes it hard to 

know what people’s last names are.11 

So  walk  it  off.  Work  it  out.  30-day  return  policy,  and  then  no  exchanges. 

America has a thriving marital counseling industry for just this reason. 

COLBERT FAMILY COUNSELING 

No family is without problems, and there’s no shame in acknowledging it by 

shaking your finger at your family members and screaming about how they’ve 

failed you. I have found that one of my many unexpected talents lies in the area 

of family counseling; I can sit down with just about any family and, without 

knowing  a  thing  about  them,  give  them  hours  of  solid  advice.  The  relief  on 

their faces at the end of our “session” is all the reward I ask. 

Now  it’s  your  turn.  Since  I  can’t  meet  face  to  face  with  everyone  who  buys 

this book (unless the sales projections are drastically off), I’d like to offer my 

services in the form of this all-purpose counseling session for a family of four. 

Just circle the choices that apply, and I think you’ll find that these are words 

to live by.12 

(Note: By reading these words you acknowledge that Stephen T. Colbert bears 

no legal responsibility for the consequences of living by them.) 

11  Annulment, on the other hand, is a fantastic option if you’re in a sticky spot. All you have to do is prove to a 
church tribunal that there was a canonical impediment to your marriage which made the sacrament invalid 
when it was performed. That last, “when it was performed” thing is the tricky part. For instance, if you’re 
really stuck on getting a divorce, you can just cheat on your wife once, and that’s grounds. For an annul-
ment, you have to prove that you fully intended to cheat on your wife even before you got married. That’s 
tough, because most guys don’t know their nannies before they get married. 

12  Or die by.  I’ve got an all-purpose eulogy that uses the same system.

I   A M   A M E R I C A   ( A N D   S O   C A N   Y O U ! )  

Happy healing! 

Welcome, Mom, Dad, Evan and Kimberly. I’m very encouraged by the fact that 

you (sought/were ordered into) family counseling, and I think together we can 

make a lot of progress. I’ve studied your family dynamic and I’d like to address 

each of you in turn. 

Dad, it’s quite obvious to me that you need to (spend more time at home/get a 

job), in order to relieve the enormous strain put on the family by your constant 

(absence/presence).  If  you  were  (more/less)  involved  in  family  life,  (Evan/ 

Kimberly/Mom) might feel some relief from the pressure that drives (his/her) 

struggle  with  (authority/drugs/pimples/cooking  sherry).  By  the  same  token, 

your (increased/decreased) presence might also allow (Evan/Kimberly/Mom) 

the perspective to decide whether (he/she) is (considering/rejecting) a career 

in  (sports/medicine/sports  medicine/law/jazz  dance)  because  (he/she)  really 

wants to, or in order to (please/infuriate) you. To put it simply, they need you 

to be at (work/home). It’s time to take another look at your (priorities/résumé) 

and put yourself (out there/back here). 

Now you, Mom. You must accept the fact that your decision to (quit/go back 

to) (work/school/drinking/Jenny Craig/your meds), while obviously a personal 

step  (forward/backward)  for  you,  also  has  consequences  for  the  family. 

Remember, emotionally you have always been their (pillar of strength/ powder 

keg), and the idea that your life choices will now be made with an eye toward 

(your  career/family  life/logic)  can  take  some  getting  used  to.  Don’t  forget, 

you’re  at  a  crossroads  yourself,  with  the  children  getting  (older/fatter)  and 

soon to be off to (college/rehab/war/Quiznos). They may not tell you, but they 

(still/no  longer)  need  you  to  (loosen/tighten/trim)  the  (apron  strings/reins/ 

hedges). Let them know that you’re (still/not) their (mom/maid/warden/camel 

drover), and I think you’ll find them more than willing to (meet you halfway/ 

Evan, I know that (making/not making) the (football team/debate club/dance 

troupe)  has  you  feeling  a  lot  of  pressure.  But  no  problem  was  ever  really

16 

T H E   F  A M I L  Y  

solved by (drugs/drinking/Santeria). And (lashing out at/ignoring/massaging) 

your  (parents/sister/teammates/priest)  isn’t  the  answer  either.  Maybe  it  will 

help if you think of the family as a (race car/video game/robot arm). All the 

parts have to work together if you’re going to (win/win/carefully manipulate 

the space shuttle’s bay doors closed). And as far as the problem you’ve been 

having with your (grades/chronic masturbation), I truly believe that the simple 

answer is just a little (more/less) time spent (studying/working your crank). 

Now  you,  Kimberly.  I’ll  be  blunt:  You  need  to  (gain/lose)  weight.  Your  body 

image  issues  are  only  masking  a  deeper  (anxiety/indifference/rage)  that  is 

the  same  impulse  behind  your  (attaching/detaching)  yourself  (from/to)  the 

school’s (in/out/geek/Goth/nerd/jock/preppie/hippie/stoner/loner/Christer) 

crowd.  Can  we  address  the  possibility  that  your  (binging/purging/cutting/ 

piercing/tattooing/promiscuity/meth use) is just your way of asking for your 

family’s (love/attention/destruction)? When left to your own devices you can 

be a very (kind/manipulative/frightening) young lady, and you shouldn’t leave 

it  to  others  to  (validate/expose)  your  (worth/crimes  against  humanity).  The 

(possibilities/sentences)  for  (young  people/juvenile  offenders)  are  (greater/ 

harsher) than ever before. (Embrace/Avoid) them. 

All right. I’m (glad/sorry) to say this has been a (very/fairly) (productive/disap-

pointing) session, but I am aware of the (time/smoldering trash fire Evan lit), 

so I’ll see you next week.

I shan’t say I have never felt the thrilling touch of an 

amorous embrace, but I also shan’t shan’t say it, for I was 

raised in a refined era when ladies did not amorously-embrace-

Oh, I have loved.

Yes, I’ve had a full life. Let me show you a page from my diary. 

6:30 am: Overslept. Queen Neferkiti is not pleased.

6:45 am: Prepared breakfast of poached eggs, jam and toast, and fried sausages. 

6:53 am: Prepare my breakfast.

7:00 am: Ate my bowl of Wheatena. 
7:30 to Noon: Wrote and mailed letters to relatives, most of whom are all deceased.  
Over the next few weeks, the letters will trickle back stamped “return to sender.”  
It’s so nice to get mail! 
Noon to 12:30: Stared. 
12:30 to 1:45: Embroidered a slip for my pillow—singular. 
2:00: A visit from the postman! The fall issue of Cat Fancy is here!

2:15 to 7:00: Fancied my cats in accordance with latest cat-fancying trends.

7:30: The neighborhood children threw rocks at “ Fearsome Grierson’s” door. I  
wanted to shout at them, “That doesn’t even rhyme!” but instead, I watched  
silently from behind the shutters. They will get theirs...

NEWS 

FLASH:  DID  YOU  NOTICE  HOW  BIG 

THE  WORD  “NEWS”  WAS  AT  THE 

BEGINNING  OF  THIS  PARAGRAPH? 

I  CONSIDERED  MAKING  ALL  THE 

WORDS  IN  THIS  CHAPTER  THAT  BIG.  AND  NOT  JUST 

BECAUSE  I  CAN’T  THINK  OF  A  QUICKER  WAY  TO 

FILL  240  PAGES.  THAT  WAS  A  JOKE,  IN  CASE  YOU 

couldn’t tell. I don’t blame you if you couldn’t. Can’t tell if someone’s making a 

joke if you can’t see that person’s face. Big reason I don’t like books. No faces. 

Can’t tell when they’re being funny. 

Being Funny 

Point is, I’m writing about seniors here, and old folks can’t read anything that’s 

not printed in a 30-point font or above. To them, this paragraph looks like an 

ant fight. Sad thing is, if they try to use a magnifying glass, the page catches 

on fire. I’ve always thought someone should fix that about magnifying glasses.  Why not call it a 
“magna-frying 
Major design flaw. 
glass?” 

Anyway, even though seniors can’t make out most of the words in this book, 

I thank them for reading it. 

21 

If seniors could read this, 
I would thank them 
here, too. 

I   A M   A M E R I C A   ( A N D   S O   C A N   Y O U ! )  

Thank you for reading 
this, seniors. 

I must say, writing a whole chapter directed at seniors is a waste of time. Can’t 

teach an old dog new tricks—they’re too tired. Plus, they’re from the library 

card  generation.  They  share  books.  They  don’t  believe  in  buying  multiple 

collectors’ copies, no matter what kind of rare, bizarre misprint appears in the 

first edition 

. No disrespect, but old people are 

useless to me. So, this chapter is now re-directed at all of you not-yet-seniors. 

Plus: Since seniors can’t read this, I can say whatever I want about them. 

They look like lizards. 

See? No angry letters. By now, some of the older readers out there are prob-

ably thinking, “What’s that Colbert boy going on about?” Let’s not forget about 

them. 

It is the duty

SOME GOOD THINGS ABOUT SENIORS 

•  

•  

They are the Greatest Generation. No other generation in history has  
ever been quite so willing to be poor, fight wars, or have babies. 
They were alive in the Good Old Days. They’re living testament to a  
time when America was #1, and so was butterscotch.

coddled segment of the population. They have everything given to them, from 

pensions to discount meals to help crossing the street. And despite all they get, 

they complain. 

NEWS  FLASH:  It’s  not  seniors’  fault  that  they’re  such  whiners.  There’s 

someone else to blame: Franklin D. Roosevelt, who gave our country Social 

Security, a system which rewards seniors for doing nothing. 

Sorry, but retirement offends me. You don’t just stop fighting in the middle of a 

war because your legs hurt. So why do you get to stop working in the middle of 

your life just because your prostate hurts? That’s desertion, which in my book 

gets you the early bird special at the firing squad buffet. 

Our elders 
are a precious 
resource. 

23 

I   A M   A M E R I C A   ( A N D   S O   C A N   Y O U ! )  

LIKE I SAID: Ever since I was a kid I’ve been baffled by retirement, pensions, 

and S.S. Want proof? Look what I found in the Colbert attic archives. Couldn’t 

have been more than seven when I wrote it: 

24 

O L D   P E O P L E  

POINT  IS:  S.S.  didn’t  make  sense  to  me  as  a  seven-year-old,  and  it  doesn’t 

make sense to me now. 

SS—why do those 
initials sound 
familiar? 

Think of it this way: If an alien came down from the Galaxy and told you that 

on his planet they have a system where all the young, hardworking aliens give 

up a large number of their glixnards for the benefit of the non-working elder 

vorzoths, and that by the time they were ready to become vorzoths themselves 

(a process involving the ingestion of a sacred mineral which renders the fore-

limbs useless for work in the plthkana mines), the glixnard cisterns might be 

dangerously depleted, you bet your sweet bippy you’d have a lot of questions. 

And yet, our human American “vorzoths” (seniors) have banded together to 

preserve their hoard of “glixnards” (money) at the expense of the young. They 

call this group the “AARP,” which probably stands for something, but to me, 

sounds like the noise an old man makes when he’s trying to get out of a bean 

bag chair. 

SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THESE YEAR-HOGGERS? 

Is  there  a  solution  to  America’s  Elderly  Crisis  that  doesn’t  involve  changing 

our lives in any way or making us feel guilty? Yes. Think of the money in the 

Social Security “Trust Fund” as investment capital. Right now, we’re putting 

that  money  into  millions  of  small-cap,  zero-yield  investments:  The  Jazzy® 

Set. No offense, but unless Leo and Dolores Shipner of Forest Hills suddenly 

decide to get off their apple pancake asses and personally invade Iran, we’re 

not getting value for our money. We need to utilize seniors’ strengths to get a

Let’s use ’em to shut down our porous Southern Border. One thing Old People 

have a knack for is keeping kids off their lawn. I remember growing up, old 

man  Schmidt  would  sit  in  that  rocking  chair  of  his  like  he  was  manning  a 

guard tower at a Nazi prison camp. One misstep onto his immaculate “Master 

Lawn” was enough to trigger the old man’s shriek of “Auf Meine Grass! Das 

ist Verboten!” I say, let’s build a 2000-mile-long front porch along our border 

with Mexico and line it with the angry aged. When the Mexicans try to cross, 

Guardpas?  they’ll be turned into Mexican’ts™ when a million Grampas bellow: 

“Get off my country! I just seeded!” 

Plus, they’re suckers for heat. 

Hey! Anybody want a 
free trip to California, 
Arizona, New Mexico, 
and /or Texas? 

Are they up to the job? Make no bones about it, old people are tough. Many 

of  them  grew  up  having  to  scrap  for  every  penny.  They  made  shoes  out  of 

newspaper and twine, and subsisted on a thin stew of newspaper and twine. 

Sometimes  they  had  to  go  without  shoes  and  stew  altogether  so  that  there 

would be enough newspaper and twine to treat the baby’s Scarlet Fever. I’d 

say they can handle Jose. 

Of  course,  the  simplest  answer  to  the  problem  of  the  aged  is  for  people  to 

stop getting old. There was a time I thought this was impossible. But that was 

before I developed my Age-Defying Protein Pudding! 

It’s based on a high gelatin diet that has kept cow hooves supple for centuries. 

I’m proud to make it available for the first time in this book.

MAKE A DIFFERENCE! 

This  little  nightmare  I  have  just  described  (and  registered  with  the  Writers 

Guild) is why I strongly recommend getting a pet—any pet—and dominating 

it. It’s the best way to remind the animal kingdom who’s the boss. Plus, nothing 

is more satisfying than subjugating a lower creature to your will. When I tell 

my dog Gipper to fetch my slippers, I feel a sense of rightful empowerment, 

placing myself at the apex of Nature’s Org Chart. 

Of course, Gipper has very sensitive legs, so when I ask him to fetch me some-

thing,  I  have  to  physically  carry  him  over  to  that  spot  and  pick  up  the  item 

myself. But believe me, he gets the idea. 

Don’t you, boy!

turkey. And yet it’s a joy that many adults no longer experience. And do you 

know why? 

Because from the time you’re a little kid, the media are feeding you lies to put 

the power structure out of whack. So before you become a pet owner, there 

are a few things you need to understand in order to put the power structure in 

of whack. 

WHEN YOU WISH UPON A LIE 

Some would have our children believe that animals are cute and cuddly. It starts 
the day we bring baby Kyle or Kallie or Kayla or Kaitlyn or Kelsie home from  Kieran , Kylie, 
Kristal, Kinsley, 
the hospital to a room wallpapered in adorable little yellow ducks. Why aren’t  Kira, Kstephen 

these ducks being pursued by adorable little yellow hunters? I don’t know, but 

I’m willing to bet that it has something to do with the Far Left media’s control 

of the wallpaper industry. (Yes, I consider the wallpaper industry part of the 

media. It has the word “paper” in it.) 

What’s  the  very  first  book  most  children  own?  A  bit  of  blatant  propaganda 

called Pat the Bunny. 

Better Option: Paté the Bunny! 

I’m on to you,

I   A M   A M E R I C A   ( A N D   S O   C A N   Y O U ! )  

Pat the Bunny isn’t 
a good book 

I’m not saying Pat  the  Bunny isn’t a good book. There’s that soft patch of 

fur  on  page  one  for  you  to  pat.  And  then  there’s  the  smooth  part  and  the 

scratchy part and don’t get me started on the mirror! There is so much to do, 

and you don’t even need to know how to read. That’s the perfect book. But a 

pro-bunny manifesto with that kind of sensory stimulation? What chance do 

All Dogs Go to Heaven? Sorry, kids. It’s only the dogs who’ve accepted 

our children have? 

Christ. 

HICKORY DICKORY SHOCK! 

You may now  
unbrace. 

Then there are the nursery rhymes. What’s a cuter image than three little kittens 

that have lost their mittens? Well, brace yourself: Kittens don’t wear mittens. 

I’m going to let that sink in. And why don’t they wear mittens? Because they’d 

just get caught on their razor-sharp claws. 

Personally  I  prefer  the  Three  Blind  Mice,  because  1)  they’re  already  handi-

capped  when  the  song  starts—as  a  result,  no  doubt,  of  some  anti-human 

scheme that blew up in their faces, and 2) they’re further maimed in the course 

Stay strong,  
Farmer’s Wife!   

of the rhyme. 

The list is endless. The cartoon characters: dogs, cats, rabbits, ducks, horses, 

squirrels, gorillas, all of them talking, all of them so very human. Of course, the 

most famous offender is Bambi, which, for reasons that escape me, portrays 

the death of a deer negatively. You can bet you’ll never see an animated classic 

about what Bambi’s mom devoured for her last meal—my defenseless oakleaf 

hydrangea! 

“Cowtow”! 
It’s right there in the  
name! 

My point is this: if America is ever to stop cowtowing to the animal-petters, 

we have to get to our youth before they do. Children have to learn that these 

animals aren’t our buddies. Sometimes it’s a tough lesson. 

BUT WHAT ABOUT ME? 

When I was a kid, I had a dog named Shasta. We were inseparable. We’d play 

in the backyard, maybe chase a ball, or just go splashin’ around the ol’ creek. 

Shasta was my best friend. 

34 

A N I M A L S  

Then after fourteen happy years together, I came home from school one day 

and Shasta didn’t greet me at the door. My mom and dad sat me down and told 

me the terrible news: Shasta had gone to live on a big beautiful farm upstate. 

I couldn’t believe it. I never felt so betrayed in my life. I thought Shasta and I 

were a team. But as soon as some smooth-talking stranger came along with 

the promise of a bigger field, she was gone. And that’s how it is with animals. 

Always looking for a better offer. 

Sorry  I  wasn’t  a  farmer,  Shasta.  The  suburb  had  zoning  laws—we  couldn’t 

grow crops in the yard. How could you? 

I pressed my parents for answers, but my mom wouldn’t stop crying, and my 

Dad  just  kept  saying  that  she  was  chasing  rabbits.  Chasing  rabbits?  I  guess 

Shasta was lying to me about that degenerative hip disease, too. 

So wake up, America. 

Pets. Don’t. Care. About. You. They’re just using you for food, and for the social 

networking you provide when you walk them. 

But  the  joke’s  on  you,  Shasta.  If  you’re  reading  this  (or  having  your  farmer 

friend  read  it  to  you),  you  should  know  that  I  have  a  new  dog,  Gipper.  And 

Gipper is twice the dog you’ll ever be. His coat is way shinier than yours, and 

he doesn’t chew up my comic books. And he hates farms.  Gipper will never 

betray me, and he’s never going to leave me. He’s been right by my side for the 

last fifteen years, and he’ll be there for the next fifty. 

So if animals aren’t our friends, then what are they? 

The answer can be summed up between two buns. 

Yet another reason not to  
give to Farm Aid

was thinking of when she  
was licking mine?

THE FACTORY FARM: AMERICA’S MOST SUCCULENT INDUSTRY 

Nation, have you ever wondered how a cow becomes a hamburger? Me neither. 

I just assumed God did it. But it turns out that food production is actually part 

of something called Agribusiness. It’s this industry that turns cows into steaks, 
pigs into bacon and everything else into gelatin.

WHO CARES? 

Upton  Sinclair  wrote  a  pro-labor  book  about  the  Chicago  stockyards  called 

The  Jungle  that  pointed  out  minor  flaws  in  the  meat  industry,  such  as  the 

frequency of severed limbs. Big deal. I knew an accountant who got his arm 

chopped off in a filing cabinet. But you’ll never hear about that in a book. 

Truth is, Upton Sinclair was a Socialist, which means what he really wanted

give it to. 

THE TRUTH: IT’S WHAT’S FOR DINNER. 

Now  some  people  complain  that  the  factory  scale  of  Agribusiness  means 

cruelty to animals, environmental destruction, and meat loaded with chemi-

cals and hormones. 

READY, PET, GO! 

But they’re not awarding any points for the fact that on the factory farm, a cow 

can go from mooing to stewing in under ninety seconds. 

Okay. Now that I’ve pulled the wool off your eyes about animals, you’re ready 

to get one and establish the proper dominant relationship. 

It’s important to select the right animal. Different lifestyles call for different 

pets to master. If you’re away from your home a lot, you may want to boss 

around a cat. If you don’t like to exercise, consider lording over an iguana or 

perhaps a weak-willed parakeet. But if you do have the time to dedicate, there 

is no beast more satisfying to dominate than the dog. 

Once you’ve selected a pet and named it, it’s time to bend the animal to your 

will. I’ve done this with my dog Gipper by teaching him a few authoritative 

commands, such as SIT. When I order Gipper to sit, I’m letting him know that 

I am his superior. Of course, Gipper has a bad back, so after I ask him to sit, I 

massage his hindquarters while I ease him onto a pillow. 

What’s on Top of a House? It’s “roof.” Not “ruff.” 

Make sure your dog says “roof.”

Just  like  with  humans,  dogs  determine  what  type  of  person  you  are  by  the

you have a weak grip, they’ll turn your neck into a chew toy. So be sure to give

THE DE-BALLIFICATION OF THE AMERICAN PETSCAPE 

Anyone who has ever spent $5 to purchase a newborn dachshund out of a card-

board box in a supermarket parking lot knows the joy of a litter of puppies. 

Without them the desk calendars of our nation’s secretaries would be blank. 

Don’t let someone

But there is a movement afoot in this country, spearheaded by certain octo-

genarian game show hosts, to spay and neuter our pets, ostensibly to control

their population. Instead of letting animals be animals these people choose to 

“Cut and Run.” 2 

At  its  very  core,  this  scissor-happy  movement  is  an  affront  to  virility  and  is 

brazenly  anti-ball.  Think  of  the  agony  you  put  your  neutered  dog  through 

when, during a simple game of fetch, you ask him to chase down and retrieve 

a symbol of his lost manhood. The Anti-Cruelty Society is performing these 

procedures! 3 And they say irony is dead!

Worst  of  all,  neutering  is  birth  control,  plain  and  simple.  Instead  of  the

remaining chaste until they are married. And yes, I am once again advocating

ON ENDANGERED SPECIES

To put it simply, certain animals are endangered because God is pissed off at 

them.  If  you  try  to  save  an  endangered  animal,  you  are  going  against  God’s 

will—and the Man knows how to hold a grudge.

modern  zoos?  Now  every  animal  has  its  own  habitat—Bear  Country,  Tiger

CANARY IN A COAL MINE 

Nation, nothing restricts freedom more than buckling a seatbelt. If I want to 

fly head first through my car windshield at 200 mph, that’s between me and 

my brain damage. But, as long as there are legislators in the pocket of Big 

Seatbelt, the regulations will keep on coming. 

Don’t believe me? Take a look at this story from abcnews.com: 

BUCKLE UP, PUP 
For  Massachusetts  canines,  flatbed  freedom  and  tongues  flapping  in 
the breeze on the open road may soon go to the dogs. Martin Walsh, a 
state  lawmaker  from  Dorchester,  Mass.,  may  file  legislation  that  will 
require dog owners to restrain pets when driving in a vehicle. 

A law to make dogs wear seatbelts! What’s next, Massachusetts? Making 

dogs wear hard hats when they chase the ball? Or life vests when they swim 

in a lake? Or safety goggles when they spot-weld? 

Never  once  did  Lassie  tell  Timmy  she  wanted  more  government  regula-

tions. “What’s that, girl? There’s a fire in the old barn? You want me to fill 

out this paperwork in triplicate and wait for someone from the main branch 

to contact me in six to eight weeks?” Ridiculous. 

  Half  the  reason  the  comic  strip  Marmaduke  is  so  funny  is  because  he’s 

always  getting  into  mischief.  If  the  government  starts  regulating  that 

mischief  with  a  bunch  of  unnecessary  safety  standards,  that  Great  Dane

idea appealing because it rhymes. But so does this: “God said to Noah there’s 

gonna be a floody-floody / Get those children out of the muddy-muddy.” 

Mine rhymes 4 times. 

The  “children”  mentioned  in  that  Bible  verse  didn’t  think  they  needed  reli-

gion either, and look what happened to them (drowny-drowny). Bottom line: 

Religion is the cornerstone of civilization. Without it, we would have no laws, 

no morality, no social structure, and no guidelines for furnishing our taberna-

cles. We would exist in a state of valueless depravity, like they do in Holland.1

GOOD NEWS 

Religion exists. And so mankind can benefit from its numerous gifts. 

Law: The Ten Commandments are the basis of our entire system of justice. 

Without  them  we  wouldn’t  have  laws,  and  without  laws  there’d  be  chaos.2 

Those  two  tablets  give  you  everything  you  need  to  run  an  orderly  society. 

Lying, stealing, murdering, adultery, idol worship and coveting are out. Parent-

honoring  and  Sabbath  observance  are  in.  By  the  way,  if  you’re  reading  this 

on your religion’s Sabbath, you’d better have a non-believer there turning the 

pages  for  you,  because  when  it  comes  to  the  T.C.s,  I’m  an  originalist.  That 

means,  if  a  neighbor  takes  so  much  as  a  covetous  glimpse  at  my  wife,  I’m 

looking for my lucky stoning hat. 

Morality: Religion lays out clear definitions of good and evil, distinguishing 

good deeds—“solids” in Biblical Hebrew—from sins. Think about it: Without 

this guidance and reward/punishment system, how would we know that it’s 

actually  good  to  give  charity  to  beggars?  Plus,  without  the  concept  of  Right 

and Wrong, we’d have no cowboy movies or cop shows because there’d be no

And forget about karaoke. I mean, “(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don’t Want to 

Be Right” is my go-to crowd pleaser, but who wants to hear “(If Loving You Is 

Okay) Then, Okay”? 

Witch trials make 
great mixers. 

Social Cohesion: Religion gives communities reasons to come together and 

build bonds through shared participation in rituals. Admit it—people would 

never speak to anyone outside their immediate families if not for mandatory 

pilgrimages to holy rocks or watching virgins’ hearts get carved out atop their

ziggurats. 

Hope:  I  believe  it  was  the  tiger-philosopher  Hobbes  who  described  human 

life as “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” Religion allows us to ignore 

all that by praying. When we appeal to our deities with a slaughtered ewe, or 

prostration, or, in the case of Hare Krishnas, airport conga line, we exert some 

control over our existence and are filled with hope that God may improve it. 

Otherwise,  we’re  just  chanting  our  deepest  desires  into  a  silent,  indifferent 

void. How depressing would that be?

to  watch  a  Discovery  Channel  special  on  butterflies.  And  what’s  on  next? 

A show about tornadoes. Who made such a harrowing program schedule full 

of seemingly random destruction? It was God’s will. 

Responsibility:  Religion  forces  every  individual  to  take  responsibility. 

Specifically,  take  it  away  from  yourself  and  give  it  to  God.  If  we  had  to  be 

accountable for every one of our actions, we’d be crippled with indecision. But 

with religion pointing the way, we can feel confident in our choice to picket 

our children’s elementary school when we find out the art teacher is gay. 

Hi, Mr. Jellineck! 

Immortality: If you’re good, you don’t “die.” It’s my favorite gift of religion, 

because it’s the most practical. For instance, I got that PBS Civil War series on 

DVDs last Christmas but I haven’t had time to watch. (I can’t wait to see how 

it  turns  out.)  But  thanks  to  religion,  after  I  depart  my  earthly  body  I’ll  have 

eternity to watch those DVDs with Abraham Lincoln. He ought to be able to 

tell me if Ken Burns3 got it right. 

So, now that you understand religion’s gifts, you can understand why America 

chose to be a Godly nation, and by Godly I mean Jesusly. 

RELIGION IN AMERICA 

Make  no  mistake:  America  is  a  Christian  nation.  The  bedrock  of  our  theo-

democracy is our Judeo-Christian Values™. That term, by the way, is a bit of 

a  misnomer.  It  implies  that  Christianity  and  Judaism  are  equal.  That  makes 

about as much sense as comparing Jesus to Moses. One of them could walk on 

water; the other one had to part it. Which one seems more Christian to you? 

Think of “Judeo-Christian” like “Sears, Roebuck & Co.”—Judaism is Roebuck. 

Now, the Secular-Progressives out there are going to say, “Hold on, Colbert. 

Wasn’t  America  founded  on  the  ideas  of  Enlightenment  thinkers  like  Hume 

and Paine?” Common misconception. Who landed at Plymouth Rock? Pilgrims.

I   A M   A M E R I C A   ( A N D   S O   C A N   Y O U ! )  

GUT-CHECK: Since the Pilgrims were victims of persecution, some 

assume they were tolerant. That’s just liberal propaganda. Sure, they were 

against persecution…of Pilgrims. But after they changed their name to 

“Puritans” (in what I believe was a copyright dispute), they were more 

than happy to drown what Lesbians now call Wiccans. 

?????? 

Pat Robertson, tear 
down this wall! 

We hear a lot about how the founders created a so-called “wall of separation 

between  church  and  state.”  The  myth  of  such  a  wall  is  exacerbated  by  our 

Constitution’s confusingly worded First Amendment: 

“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion…” 

Many  point  to  these  words  as  somehow  prohibiting  the  establishment  of 

Christianity as our national religion. But if the founders were so anti-Christian, 

It’s not “We the 
Ape-People.” 

how come the Constitution never mentions evolution? 

And  even  if  I’m  wrong,  just  because  “Congress  shall  make  no  law”  doesn’t 

mean that we can’t establish a religion. It just means we’ll have to do it without 

Or just a 
knowing wink 

Congress. An executive order, perhaps? 

So, to sum up: America is a Christian nation. And as the old Negro spiritual 

says, “This Train is bound for Glory, this Train.” Folks, America is riding the 

Jesus Train. 

Attention travelers: Please note that the Jesus Train is NOT the Crazy Train

Jesus founded only One Church and it wasn’t Unitarian. He took 

His apostle Simon and made him into a rock and built a church on

him. It’s called “the Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church,” 

or “Church” for short. 

Catholics have many advantages over other Christians. One is marble. For the 

buck I put into the collection plate, I want some production value. That means 

a church, not some community center that doubles as a basketball court. 

Also,  Catholics  have  saints—more  than  10,000  of  them.  They’re  like  God’s 

customer  service  reps,  and  each  of  them  has  a  specialty.  Say  you  lose  your 

wallet. You could bother the Creator to help you find it, but if you’re a Catholic, 

you don’t have to. Just pray to St. Anthony. Finding lost things is all he does. 

For Eternity. Also, there are times when you might want to pray to St. Agatha. 

She’s the patron saint of nursing and bell-making. If you’re both a nurse and a 

bell-maker, that’s one-stop shopping. 

Some are put off by the labyrinthine structure of Catholic dogma, but many 

of its rituals are quite beautiful, and not just when edited together as a tense, 

poetic counterpoint to brutal violence in Mafia films. 

But maybe you’re not ready to be a Roman Catholic. Well, as the saying goes, 

“There are many roads to God.” Some are just more twisty than others. So if 

you want to get a little needless exercise, why don’t you try one of these Goat

But instead of stepping up and making a commitment to one, holy, apostolic

So we get it, Protestants. You’ve had your 490-year “protest”—let’s move on. 

Martin Luther was probably right to translate the Bible into German, and I’ll 

grant that he may have had a legitimate beef about selling indulgences. But 

let’s  stop  living  in  the  past.  Whenever  you’re  ready,  the  Church’s  doors  are 

always open. We’ll let you back into eternal salvation, and all you have to do 

is say a few Hail Marys, feel a little guilty, and deliver us your massive army of 

lockstep values voters. 

Plus, if you come back into the fold, I’ve got some bargain-basement relics you 

might be interested in. I’m talking rare, primo St. Ebrulf shinbone. 

It blows. 

That’s my general take on Protestantism. Here’s the blow-by-blow: 

Episcopal Church 

Why don’t Episcopalians just come out and say it: They’re 

Anglicans. A bunch of Tory Loyalist Brit-o-philes living in our 

midst, just waiting for the day America lets her guard down so they 

can slip tea into our coffeemakers, bayonet our bald eagles, and 

reinstate Henry VIII. Let’s keep an eye on these people. 

Don’t be a

What, the Church of England wasn’t heretical enough for you? 

Methodism 

Presbyterians 

“Forgive us our debts?” 
Who are they, Bono? 

Presbyterians are identical to Methodists except that one of them 

says “debts” instead of “trespasses” in the Lord’s Prayer. Hundreds 

of years of bitter armed conflict has failed to resolve this differ-

ence. How many more lives must be lost? 

Baptists 

I’m a pious guy, but even I have my limits. I draw the line right 

around spending 8 hours in church every Sunday. Church should 

be a solemn 45 minutes to sit quietly and feel guilty, with donuts at

Quakers9

These folks produced only two things I like—Oatmeal and Richard 

Actually the rice cakes 
aren’t bad either. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints 

(Mormonism) 

To their credit, Mormonism’s founders did something that other 

self-proclaimed prophets throughout history never thought of: They 

lived in America. I’ll admit it even makes me a bit uncomfortable to 

think that my doctrine was established somewhere as unseemly as 

the Middle East. 

The Church was founded after prophet Joseph Smith left a lucra-

tive career divining for treasure to find the golden plates containing 

the Book of Mormon, which describes a visit by Jesus to America 

after He left Jerusalem. Evidently He was ascending to Heaven, got 

just above the clouds, and took a hard left. 

On the plus side, any guy who’s ever agonized over “boxers or briefs” 

before a hot date should consider Mormonism.10 They have special 

underwear, so that decision is made for you. Plus, pre-marital sex 

is prohibited. Casual sex is really not a problem at all to these guys, 

even after you’re married. The Church wants you to have 11 kids, so 

sex is never going to be casual. It is going to be work. 

And I’ll give the Mormons this: They know which way the wind 

blows. When America decided that polygamy wasn’t the way to go, 

the Mormons changed their ways and banned it. They had similar 

changes in policy when public opinion turned against the traditions

of massacring pioneers and believing that all Black people are evil. 

Pretty much whenever the general populace decides that Mormons 

are a sinful crazy cult, their leader receives a message straight from 

God that makes everything OK. This practice continues to this 

day; you can see it in the way that Mitt Romney was pro-choice 

when he was running for governor of Massachusetts, but was 

divinely inspired to become pro-life when he was running for the 

Republican nomination for president. 

On the minus side, you could be ex-communicated by Donny 

Osmond. 

Judaism 

Now, I have nothing but respect for the Jewish people. Since the 

Bible is 100% the true Word of God, and the Jews believe in the 

Old Testament,11 that means Judaism is 50% right. 

My biggest problem with Judaism is its tradition of literary criticism. Its highest 

ideal is to sit around studying day and night. I can’t trust any religion with that 

kind of book-fetish. As much as I love the Bible, even I can only read so much 

in one bathroom sitting. Let alone the Talmud. Seriously, Rashi, every tractate 

needs a commentary? It wouldn’t hurt to take a seltzer break once in a while. 

Also, there’s this whole notion of “Jewish Guilt.” Hmm, sounds familiar. Maybe 

because it was originally called “Catholic Guilt”! Quit trying to steal our spot as 

guiltiest religion, Jews. If your mother knew about this blatant theft, it would 

kill her—kill her. 

They don’t even need the guilt. They’ve got plenty of other ways to make them-

selves miserable. Just look at their holidays. The most important one involves 

spending a day not eating and thinking about all the bad things they’ve done. 

You get the day off from work, and you spend it moping. Count me out! 

Look, guys, you need to lighten up. I’ve been to Jewish weddings—I know you 

can cut loose when you want to. That thing with the chair is crazy. Let’s bring 

around a little more of that.

THE BIBLE 

Here’s all you need to know. 

THE OLD TESTAMENT 

After Jesus showed up, the Old Testament basically became a way for Bible 

publishers to keep their word count up. 

Of course, just because Jesus replaces the Old Testament doesn’t mean you 

should necessarily skip it. That would be like skipping Batman & Robin just 

because the story starts over in Batman Begins.13 The important thing to realize 

is that both the old and the new stories are about an all-powerful being trying 

to rid the world of evildoers, only in the new one The Batman can eat pork.

replacement for the Old Testament, but if you want to save some shelf-space 

by tearing it out of the Bible and replacing it with this book, I’m sure God will

OTHER HEATHENS 

Shinto 

Shinto is a Japanese religion based on the worship of kami, or 

spirits,  which  inhabit  everything.  So  any  object  or  concept  you 

want to pray to, you can. Sometimes the kami are even stacked up 

double: For example, each tree has a kami in it, but then there’s 

Provided none are

another kami for all trees. So, first strike against this bull-Shint? It’s inefficient. 

I could probably run that religion with half its current spirit workforce. And 

those savings would get passed directly to the believer. 

Plus, a whole bunch of magical beings based in different parts of nature? That’s 

not  a  religion,  that’s  Pokemon.  Which  shows  how  Shinto  hooks  you—once 

you’ve prayed to a few spirits, you’ve “gotta catch ’em all!”

Hinduism 

I’m torn on Hinduism. On the one hand, they believe in karma 

and reincarnation, where good things happen to people who do 

good deeds and bad things happen to people who do bad deeds. 

Then after you die, they take a look at your karma account and 

you come back as something better or worse, depending on how 

you did. I like this philosophy, because it means if you’re good enough in this 

life, you can be reincarnated as a Catholic. And if this stuff is true, I was one 

amazing Hindu in my last life. And given the amount of good I’m doing now, it’s 

A god, or whatever 

Next Stop: Nirvanaville for me. 

Also, Hindu gods make fantastic stuffed animals. They’ve got us there. When 

it  comes  to  merchandising,  the  Catholic  Church  doesn’t  have  anything  to 

compete with a blue elephant head.15 

But there’s plenty to be worried about. First off, they got us in the numbers 

game. There are how many people in India who worship how many gods with 

how many arms? Multiply all that together, and the results are truly terrifying. 

What worries me more is their injunction against beef. There’s nothing more

mouth-watering than a strong, healthy bovine in the artificial-hormone-induced 

prime of life. So what if it could be my great-grandfather reincarnated? I’d be 

honored to pass through the colon of my descendants. Give me a break. 

Buddhism 

Another go-figure religion. “Hey, why don’t we all put on robes 

and  sit  in  a  rock  garden  and  just,  like,  be  aware?”  Exactly. 

That’s the easiest rhetorical question I’ve ever asked. Buddhism 

instructs its followers to forsake attachment to material things. 

Hey, Buddhists— 
this book is a thing. 

Go for it, guys. That’s just more material things for those of us who have enough 

sense to glorify our Lord with speedboats. 

And  frankly,  I’m  offended  by  this  idea  of  the  so-called  “middle  way,”  the 

Buddhist doctrine of avoiding extremes. What’s the point of religion without 

extremes? You’re either a believer who’s guaranteed a seat at God’s right hand

Scientology

was dictated by the angel Gabriel to the final prophet Mohammed,

This  fast-growing  but  controversial  religion  is  attracting  some 

smart people. At least they seem smart—they certainly know a lot

secrecy and willingness to sue dissenters, but if you figured out the secret to

Though  I  may  disagree  with  Scientology  on  a  number  of  things—like  the 

notion that Galactic Lord Xenu exiled Thetans to Earth in spaceships shaped 

exactly like late 60s-era DC-8 airplanes, and then stacked them around volca-

noes and blew them up with hydrogen bombs 75 million years ago, and the

Rastafarianism 

Any  religion  that  sees  20th  century  Ethiopian  emperor 

Haile Selassie17 as a member of the Holy Trinity is worth our 

suspicion. Then again, any religion whose messiah’s name 

isn’t  recognized  by  Microsoft  Word  can’t  be  that  much  of 

a threat. My main beef with these folks is that they try to 

make smoking grass acceptable by labeling it a “sacrament.” In my book, that

All Other Crazy Cults 

The  problem  with  cults  is  that  they  don’t  have  the  brass  to  be 

honest  from  the  get-go.  They  hide  behind  phrases  like  “self-

improvement workshop” or “human potential coach” or “improv 

class,” then they slowly sneak in the crazy stuff so that you don’t 

notice. If they had any guts, in the very first cult meeting they’d say, “You all 

need to wear yellow bedsheets and have sex with me twice a day until we get 

beamed up to a comet in twelve years. Also, give me all your money.”18 Then 

we wouldn’t have a problem—the wacky people can still join, and the people

Atheists 

These  No-goodnik  no-Godniks  are  growing  in  numbers  and

Luckily, a recent survey published in the American Sociological

sense—at least we trust the homosexuals with our hair. 

But here’s the biggest head-scratcher of all: Not only are atheists destroying 

our country, they’re completely deluding themselves. There’s simply no way to 

prove that there is no God. If I didn’t hate them so much, I’d feel bad for these 

folks. Imagine going through life completely duped into thinking that there’s 

no invisible, omniscient higher power guiding every action on Earth. It’s just so 

arbitrary! Can’t they see? 

What’s worse is that atheists blindly follow whatever their scientists tell them

People of faith like you and me are under attack. Especially people like me.

federal government, except for the judicial and executive. Did you know that

California’s 13th district, to name just one. Just think of it—how are any pro-

is  despite  the  fact  that  it  also  displayed  a  sign  telling  people  they  could  see 

a  menorah  two  towns  over.  But  balance  isn’t  what  the  wall-of-separation-

between-church-and-state-huggers  are  after.  They  just  want  to  marginalize 

people of faith of all kinds and push us into the corners of American Life. So, 

down  the  display  came.  It’s  easy  to  imagine  this  sort  of  thing  is  happening 

everywhere. Where will it end? 

A Visit from St. Secular 

’Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house 
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse; 
Mamma in her kerchief, and I in the nude, 
Were shocked that our holiday had been misconstrued, 
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, 
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter. 
(Mind you, I’m still nude.) 
Out to the lawn in my glory, I flew. 
To see my manger disassembled by the ACLU. 
–Written by Clement C. Moore, 1822 

–Updated by Stephen Colbert, 2007 

Still nude 

Imagine a time in the not-too-distant future—December 24th, but instead of 

festive  lights  and  glowing  Santas,  the  streets  are  illuminated  by  police  heli-

copters. Meanwhile, in the streets, roving gangs of children terrorize the city. 

They  have  zero  respect  for  authority  because  whether  a  child  is  naughty  or 

nice, everyone gets the same thing for Christmas: Jack Squat. So they’ve gone 

wild.  It’s  like  Devil’s  Night  in  Detroit,  only  there’s  still  stuff  worth  burning. 

As the fires rage, bands of depressed alcoholic derelicts, once jolly carolers, 

shuffle aimlessly, no longer sharing their cheerful seasonal hymns, but instead 

searching  for  a  death  that  will  never  come.  God  rest  ye,  merry  Gentlemen. 

And of course, now that there’s no Christmas, insects have grown to enormous 

63

size. So everyone has to dodge the ants and beetles that are crushing buses in 

their powerful mandibles. 

The correct answer: 
no 

Does my vision of a world without Christmas sound far-fetched? This is exactly 

the future the Secul-azis want for your children and grandchildren.

EVOLUTION IS REAL! 

Big  Secularism’s  plan  is  to  keep  eroding  our  holiday.  Little  by  little,  they’re 

taking away a manger here, a “Come All Ye Faithful” there, until pretty soon 

there’s  nothing  left.  That’s  why  we’ve  got  to  dig  in  our  heels  and  celebrate 

the holiday bigger than ever. If you usually get one tree, this year get two. If 

you usually do two, have five. The BSists need to understand that there is no 

number of trees we are unwilling to cut down to prove our point. 

You heard me! Y’see, there’s nothing I like more than using the Big Secularism 

against itself.

A  C H A N C E  FO R  AV E R AG E  A M E R I C A N S  TO  AG R E E  W I T H  W H AT  I  T H I N K  

I think it’s wonderful that Stephen has written such a 

considerate chapter on Me. Hopefully these pages will decrease 

the number of skeptics out there, though I understand why 

some people are atheists and agnostics. It’s not going to spare 

them the Eternal torment of Hell, but I understand. Hey, my 

fault for giving you all Free Will. 

I could convince everybody that I exist by stepping up the

day, you know? 

This gets to the main question that everyone usually asks Me: 

If I’m so all-powerful, why don’t I answer everyone’s prayers? 

The answer: I used to. 

Back in the day, fewer people prayed for me to do things for them. There was a lot 

more thanksgiving, and it’s less time-consuming to answer prayers that are praising 

you for things. Those were the good old days. Now it’s gimme, gimme, gimme. 

It especially shows up in sports. Used to be, you never had both sides pray for 

victory. One team max, and 9 times out of 10 that team was Notre Dame. Now, you’re 

guaranteed to have counteracting prayers. What am I supposed to do? For Me, it’s liter-

ally a no-win situation. I usually have no choice but to answer the prayer of whichever 

team is better. 

practiced more. 

Of course, I can’t get caught playing favorites. So if I do help a team, it’s not going to 

be with something cool and dramatic like a line drive that suddenly lifts up and carries 

over the fence. Instead, I usually just go back in time and make the winning team have 

I mean, if there’s one team that is clearly more righteous, yes, I’ll help that team, 

although sometimes I’ll help the team of sinners instead because I love a good 

underdog. Plus that nudge might set them on the righteous path, or there could be a 

sick kid, or there’s some other factor... you know what? It’s complicated. You’d really 

have to be Everywhere. 

exceptions. 

Oh, and let me say this—if I have money on a game, I never help either team. No 

So, in regular life, why do I answer some prayers and not other prayers? Pretty 

much the same reasoning as sports. Do I return the runaway to her family, or do I get 

that guy his dream job? (Yes, I do pair up all prayers.) 

It’s not totally random. I have a system, although I can’t really explain it in a way 

that will make sense to someone without Ultimate Knowledge. Put it this way: If I’ve 

helped you find your car keys 20 times, don’t bother calling Me when you get a tumor. 

You guys in the USA don’t know how good you have it. Your nation is crazy blessed 

already. When the Dow breaks 14,000—that’s a mudslide in Guatemala. So, you know, 

try to keep it in perspective.

MY AMERICAN ADOLESCENCE 

I was thirteen when we moved from the dirt road where I grew up to the big 
city of Charleston, where the rich kids lived—kids whose families had been 
there since it had been Charles Towne or, even earlier, Chuck Mound. 

My new school gave me an opportunity I never had before—getting beaten 
up every day. On those rare days when I was not beaten, the next morning I’d 
find a note in my locker: “Sorry we forgot to beat you yesterday. We’ll beat you 
twice as hard today.” No one can touch Southerners for manners. 

The daily beatings lost some of their intensity during the football season, 
when  my  jock  tormentors  were  able  to  split  their  latent  Homosexual  Rage 
between my torso and their locker-room hijinks. This lull allowed my swelling 
to go down, and it turned out I had facial features. The girls noticed. Soon I was 
a regular on the debutante circuit where I tried scoring a few “touchdowns” of 
my own. The beatings began again. Some of those debs were pretty tough. 

When I left for college, I was determined never to be a victim again. I would 
take my lead from the Hollywood tough guys I had always looked up to: Charles 
Bronson, Clint Eastwood, Ned Beatty. So on Day One of my freshman year at 
Dartmouth, I walked into class and punched the first person I saw—my Ethics 
professor,  Dr.  Buneta.  Judging  by  the  grade  he  gave  me,  holding  a  grudge 
passes for “ethical” in the Ivy League. I don’t know what the big deal was. That 
beard had to absorb some of the impact. 

I include this coming-of-age tale because it encompasses the five big Ss of 

Adolescence: 

School, Sports, Sex, Sodomy, and the Silver Screen. 
Trust me, they’re all in there.

OF  BOTH  TESTOSTERONE  AND

remove from your cable package and stop paying for, even if you make it clear 

that’s what you want.  

Respond to my 
letters, Comcast! 

So, if I’m no cheerleader of sports, why write a chapter about it? Sports do 

have some positive impact on society. They solve problems, such as how to get 

inner-city kids to spend $175 on shoes. They serve as a backdrop for some of 

our most memorable commercials. And they remain the one and only relevant 

application of math. Not only that, but we have sports to thank for most of 

the last century’s advances in manliness. The system starts in school, where 

gym class separates the men from the boys. Then those men are taught to be 

winners, or at least, losers that hate themselves. 

Nothing puts hair on

HISTORY LESSON 

Modern  “sports”  as  we  know  them  originated  in  ancient  Rome,1  when  civic 

officials realized that it would be much easier to get contestants for their gladi-

ator contests if the loser was not killed. Once everyone realized that a live loser 

could be humiliated for much longer than a dead one, the idea caught on. 

Back then, a sport was only what could be achieved with the human body— 

how fast can you run, how far can you throw, how big a thing can you lift, or 

push, or kill. But the ideal of sports as an exhibition of human accomplishment 

ended in 1893 when they started using football helmets. In my book, drawing 

the impact away from your skull defeats the entire purpose of hitting some-

thing with your head.

1 Some Ivy Leaguers claim that sports, in fact, originated in Ancient Greece.  But athletes back then were nude 
men covered in oil, which means that the Ancient Greek sports were pretty gay, and therefore, not sports “as 
we know them.”  There are no gays in modern sports, with the one exception being all of women’s sports.

“rules,” especially when it comes to sports. That’s just Big Government

SPORTS IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM 

The big story in sports right now is athletes taking drugs, making themselves 

better with steroids and human growth hormone. Some people have a problem 

with this, but not me. 

NEWS FLASH: Athletes perform for our enjoyment. So “performance-

enhancing drugs” are really “enjoyment-enhancing drugs.” 

Bravo, Mr. Bonds. 

Also no going back 
post-Black. 

The  fact  is,  Americans  want  the  best  of  everything.  That’s  why  Americans 

won’t watch women’s basketball. Every time I see a lady make a shot I think, “I 

bet a guy could’ve made that better.” “Enhanced” athletics are the same way. 

Back  in  the  day  when  sports  consisted  of  little  slow  guys  hitting  set  shots, 

bunting, and staging Statue of Liberty plays, the public was satisfied because 

they didn’t know any better. But now that we’ve seen huge behemoths with 

2% body fat and misshapen foreheads leap over piles of bodies to crush each 

other’s larynx, we can’t go back. That’s why I’m proposing the end of all regula-

tions on what athletes do to themselves. If a guy wants to shoot himself up 

with hormones or chimp sperm, that’s his business. The only thing that matters 

is performance on the field. Now a lot of people ask, “What kind of message 

would this send to our young people?” To which I reply, “Don’t suck. Go the 

extra mile to actually be good or you’ll be selling insurance.” With those forces 

at work in the marketplace of modern scientific body modification, our sports 

will continue to be the most entertaining in the world. 

TRASH TALK 

Sometimes the best performance-enhancing drugs come from the mind. This 

might  come  in  handy  when  there  aren’t  any  regular  performance-enhancing 

drugs around, or maybe you have them but there’s no time to inject. Like when 

you’re  in  that  five-on-five  company  league  hoops  game  covering  the  sweaty

guy with the mustache and knee brace—let’s call him Carl 2 —and he’s driving 

toward  the  basket  and  your  only  options  are  A)  to  plant  a  shoulder  in  his 

meaty flank or B) let him score. That’s when it’s time to let loose with option 

C) a little trash-talk. 

Try this: 

“Hey Carl, what’s your favorite system of geologically significant caverns? 

Mine is ‘Carlsbad’... at basketball!” 

Did I need to hit him that hard? Maybe not, but in the heat of after-work coed 

basketball, you don’t always have time to perceive your opponent as a human. 

Healthy  trash-talk  is  a  vital  pillar  of  the  Temple  of  Sport,  and  as  with  the 

Acropolis its erosion portends the downfall of our civilization. 

“Hey, let’s give everyone a trophy, even the kid who never gets put in the game 

and seems to enjoy himself anyway.”  That’s what Coach PC Police says. 

Well, I’ve got a trophy for that kid, and it’s a big bronze boot to commemorate 

his being kicked out of the league. I don’t want my son thinking that medioc-

rity is an option—“Success or Exposure,” that’s the Colbert motto. We need 

to  teach  our  children  that  their  peers  are  competitors  for  food,  shelter,  and 

eventually mates. And I know I’m not going to win any awards for saying that, 

probably because these days all the awards have already been given out for 

Even during the 
work day, it’s hard 
to perceive Carl 
as a human. 

I’m sure Carl would 
say the same thing. 

We must stop Carl 
from mating. 

“Good Effort.” 

The scene: Weehawken, New Jersey. A duel between Alexander Hamilton 

and Aaron Burr. As Hamilton loads his dueling pistol, Burr tells him only 

fools and mountebanks will use the ten-dollar bill. Hamilton takes umbrage 

and begins to tell Burr that firstly the ten-dollar bill does not yet exist, and 

furthermore only dead people can legally appear on U.S. curren…BANG! 

Welcome to my wallet, Al.

dribble in. No one drives my lane without paying a toll.

My favorite places to trash-talk are professional sporting events. Sure, there’s 

no way I could perform at the same level as a professional athlete. But just 

because I can’t beat LeBron James in a dunking contest doesn’t mean I can’t 

try and lure him into the stands for a fistfight by pointing out that his trade-

mark headband makes him look like the ringleader of a 1980s exercise video. 

SOME PEOPLE are going to say trash-talk is the last refuge of the desperate. 

You can see these people coming a mile away, in their tweed coats with the 

Morning  Edition

  Travel  Mugs.  To  them  I  say,  “Since  when  did  the  spirit  of 

competition become some kind of wet nurse for the weak?” Pointing out an 

adversary’s flaws is a tradition as old as wife-stealing. So, when sporting, never 

hesitate to dish out heaping servings of hearty smack-pie. 

THE SPORTS BREAKDOWN 

With the overabundance of sports out there, how do you know which ones to 

watch? Easy, I’m going to tell you. There are some sports that deserve your 

respect and adoration and others that should be ignored—I’m looking at you, 

Soccer. First, let’s go over the sports you should be recording nightly on your 

home Digital Video Recorder.

BASEBALL: Baseball is as American as apple pie. In fact, I’ve often thought 

the game should be played with an apple instead of a ball. I have a lot of other 

great ideas! 

There’s a reason that baseball is the National Pastime, and it’s not just because 

it  is  our  most  popular  sport,  after  football,  basketball,  and  NASCAR  racing. 

It is that the simple joy of hitting something with a stick is one that speaks to 

every American child, regardless of race, class, or upbringing. Wherever there 

are  sticks,  or  long  pieces  of  processed  wood,  you  can  find  children  hitting 

something with them. As the child grows, so does the challenge—can you hit 

something that doesn’t want to be hit? And thus begins the child’s lifetime love 

of baseball. Unfortunately, the integrity of the sport has been sullied by our 

sex-crazed  culture.  I’ve  heard  from  a  worldly  4th  grader  that  “rounding  the 

bases” is a euphemism for “going all the way” with a girl. Why don’t you youths 

try rounding the abstinence bases instead?

7th INNING STRETCH:

 “Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks...” Hey, 

buy them yourself! Just more melodic proof that we are living in a welfare 

state. 

Baseball reflects the American dream in many other ways. Baseball players 

are very well paid, and they get to stand around in a park most of the time. 

Once in a while, a ball comes their way, but the rest of the game can be spent 

scanning the crowd for hot girls. When their team comes up to bat, baseball 

players  are  considered  incredibly  skilled  if  they  can  do  their  job  35%  of  the 

time. In almost all other American professions, workers are expected to get 

that number up to at least 45% or they’d be fired.

that comes Field of Dreams, then For the Love of the Game, and then

WORLD’S  STRONGEST  MAN  COMPETITION: 

I’ve  said  it  before—it’s 

not really a sport unless there’s the possibility of dislodging your intestines. 

Luckily,  the  Met-Rx  World’s  Strongest  Man  Competition  fits  this  bill.  It  uses 

a complex and indisputable formula to crown its champion. You are truly the 

most powerful man on earth if you can pull a semi with your teeth, hurl a keg 

full of lead shot over a wall, and lift at least 20 natives of the impoverished 

country in which the event is held.3

COCKFIGHTING: There’s an easy way to tell which came first, the chicken  
or the egg: Attach a cockspur to both of them and let them fight it out.  

My money is on the egg. Those Grade A Jumbos have a lot of attitude.

FIGURE  SKATING:  Figure  skating—including  individual  and  pairs,  but 

excluding  ice  dancing,  figure  skating’s  gay  cousin—has  everything  I  could 

possibly  wish  for  in  a  sport.  Speed,  beauty,  smooth  jazz,  sequins,  and  the 

chance  that  someone  could  at  any  moment  obliterate  every  tendon  in  their 

knees. While it is true that certain Soviet and Chinese people frequently outdo 

Americans at this sport, that’s OK because skating is 

all they ever do. 

BASKETBALL:

 We invented basketball, and it has become so popular that 

we’ve  developed  two  versions  of  it:  the  college,  or  “classic,”  version  of  the 

game,  in  which  rules  are  followed  and  at  most  above-average  athletes  can 

excel; and the NBA version of the game, in which 7-foot-tall monster freaks leap 

about  on  trampolines  while  swinging  their  massive  elbows  like  cudgels  and 

running four steps without dribbling before taking off from their opponent’s 

foul line to slam dunk. Each version can be appreciated on its own merits: the 

NBA for its display of superhuman abilities and larger-than-life personas, and 

college for its easy-to-understand gambling format. While it’s true that Team 

USA hasn’t come in better than 3rd place in most recent World Competitions, 

that’s OK, because the losses are more due to the hubris of our players than 

their abilities, thus teaching our children a sound moral lesson: If you make 

enough money in what you do, it doesn’t matter if you have your ass handed to 

you by a Lithuanian.

TIME OUT: Nothing is less American than the Army-Navy game. Whichever 

side you pick, you’re rooting against our boys. The Army and Navy squads 

should be combined, and they should play football against teams from any 

other  country,  and  instead  of  footballs  they  would  used  bomb-balls.  And 

Air Force can do kickoffs. 

FOOTBALL: Football started out as a great idea: “What if we took rugby and 

got rid of the part where guys stick their heads in each others’ butts?” The idea 

caught on. Soon someone realized that the game would be even more fun if 

you could throw the ball forward. This change took football into its golden 

age, which continued until they switched over to cowhide. Much of the drama 

is gone from football these days, as technology has taken over. Plastic helmets 

have replaced the far more stylish helmets which were less about protecting 

the head and more about clothing it.

SYNCHRONIZED  SWIMMING: I defy you to watch this sport and tell me  I told you to ignore these. 

Skip Ahead! 

the Olympics have no hidden gay agenda, and probably some kind of nose clip 

kickback scheme going on as well. Besides, a sport in which you win by doing 

exactly what your partner is doing goes against our American tradition of indi-

viduality; it’s the aquatic equivalent of the Soviet army marching in lockstep 

through Red Square, if that army were also wearing women’s bathing suits and 

occasionally twirling in unison. So I reject synchronized swimming, and call 

instead for it to be replaced by an improvised freestyle underwater dance jam. 

Still gay, but now American gay. 

A QUICK NOTE ABOUT THE OLYMPICS 

The  Olympics  began  in  perversion:  greased  up  naked  men  slapping  hot 

sweaty body parts against one another’s taut and hairless flesh in pursuit of 

victory, like Chippendale’s dancers at an after-hours party. And the tradition 

of perversion4 continues—because as an international athletic competition, 

the Olympics are a warped, watered-down version of the only worthy contest

between nations: war. 

True  arguments  over  international  status  are  not  settled  by  who  can  throw 

a fancy hubcap farther. They are settled by invasion. Sure, war takes longer 

than a 100-meter footrace, but it’s much more dramatic, and you don’t have 

to pretend to care about the bronze. Now, I’m not saying that every four years 

we should have a World War. Such a scenario would play hell with my stock 

portfolio.  I’m  simply  saying  that  the  modern  Olympics  should  be  more  like 

war, in that there should be consequences for winning and losing. The Koreans 

beat Italy in slalom? They get Michelangelo’s David. Rwanda beats Sweden in 

the high jump? They get to move to Sweden. If Afghanistan defeats us in the 

biathlon, they can have Connecticut. Warning to you, Connecticut—support 

our president.

FENCING: I like the concept. I don’t like the masks, or protective jumpsuits, 

and for God sake use a real sword, not those effete little French things. I mean, 

does “epee” sound like something you could open an artery with? You need 

a blade that wouldn’t embarrass a pirate, or maybe one of those martial arts 

swords that looks like a long walking stick but then when a guy tries to attack 

you, you pull it apart and whoosh! It’s actually two swords. Speaking of martial 

arts, a few throwing stars couldn’t hurt fencing, or any sport for that matter. 

And  can  we  please  get  rid  of  that  ridiculous  electronic  scoring  system  that 

uses sensors to tell us someone has made a hit? That’s what blood is for.

A  C H A N C E  FO R  AV E R AG E  A M E R I C A N S  TO  AG R E E  W I T H  W H AT  I  T H I N K  

They say football is a game of inches, or maybe that’s 

baseball. You know what? Who cares? Because if you care 

about inches, play horseshoes. 

Football is the game I love. That’s why I’ll brave five-degree 

weather to stand in a beer line. Those guys are out there playin’ 

for me, the least I can do is show up and drink. 

Coming through with beers here! Coming through! Deb, can 

you grab one? C’mon. Drink fast and keep up with me, because 

I’m not gonna make extra trips for you in between my beer 

runs. You know exactly what I’m talkin’ about. 

So, why do I love football? Is it because of the action? 

The Guy Sitting Next 
to You At The Stadium 

You bet your sweet derri-ass, but that’s only part of the story, because the real game 

happens in the mind. It’s like chess. Kick ooofff! Let’s fucking do this! Run, you 

stupid son of a bitch! Run! Wedge, throw the wedge! Oh, come ooonnnnnn! Deb, 

you watching this?! What are you doing? Are you kidding me? Who are you talkin’ 

to? What are you talkin’ to her for? Fuck Deb, we’re at the game, what’s with all the 

talking? Why aren’t you drinkin’?  You’re already behind. 

I remember when I was a kid my Dad used to take me to the games. I used to keep a 

sheet on all the players. I remember all the great ones: Sweetness, Jack “The Assassin” 

Tatum, “Babalu,” “Bucketfoot Al,” “Le Demond Blond,” “Touchy Taffy,” and “Dr. 

Puntenstein.” Those guys gave a hundred and ten percent on the field every Sunday, 

just so a dad who wasn’t home much could have the chance to spend a few hours with 

his arm around his son sitting on a cold wooden seat sharing a beer. Ohhhhh! Look who 

they’re putting in! Whooo hooo! Pennington. Fucking Pennington! Hey, PENNINGTON! 

You pretty boy! You whiney country club pussy! It’s gonna be a long day, Pennington. 

It’s gonna be a looong fuckin’ day! Hold on to the ball you bastard! FUUUUUCK! Oh 

FUMBLE! Get on that BALL! Yeah!! Debbie, look-look. You see that big pile? I hear guys 

on the bottom of that thing are brutal. Gougin’ eyes, grabbin’ balls, squeezing balls, 

bitin’ balls. Wait, here comes the ref. What!!! Bullshit! COME ON! Bullll-Shit, Bullll-

Shit, Bullll-Shit! Yeah, Deb, you got it. Bullll-Shit! Did you see that shit? 

Hey, so uh Deb, what’d Tricia have to say? What!? I’m just trying to be interested. 

Jesus, Debbie. No! You’re so jealous. Forget it. No, seriously, forget it. Drop it. Jesus, 

Deb. Jesus. Let’s go DE-fense! Let’s get a STOP! 

Some things don’t change for the players, whether they’re home or away. When 

you’re on the field, you gotta knock people down, and you gotta put ’em down to stay 

down. That’s it. Easy math. But what does change is, when you’re home, you’ve got the 

fans. Fans can definitely sway a game. Collectively we’re like an extra player. All these 

people filling up these seats are like my teammates and we are here to rock the house 

and kick some ass. 

Nachos! 

  What the fuck man? You just cashed my fucking nachos! I had ’em balanced on the 

arm rest dipshit, and you rattled the whole row of seats with that fat train of yours! 

What the fuck are you doin’?! You gonna scoop the cheese off the ground too? No? 

Well, what the fuck good are nachos without the cheese? I don’t care how old he is, 

if he’s so upset, let him cover his fucking ears. What? Go ahead say it again! Say it 

agoddamngain, go ahead! I don’t a give shit, Deb! No, I won’t sit down! 

I’m gonna get more beer. 

Watch out, man. Beers coming through. Sack! Shit, yeah! Did you see that Deb!? 

How’s the turf taste, Sixteen? Huh? How’s that taste! You suck! You suck shit! Right 

Deb? 

Some Americans spend their Sundays in church, but football is my religion. This 

is where I worship, in the house that Lombardi built. INTERCEPTION! Oh-oh-OH

SEX AND DATING CHAPTER PLEDGE FOR UNWED YOUTH 

I,  the  undersigned,  pledge  to  remain  sexually  abstinent  until  married  to  a 

person of the opposite sex and of legal age. I swear that any knowledge I gain 

in the following pages regarding human sexuality will be applied only in the 

private context of a nuptial bed, nuptial kitchen, nuptial bathroom floor, or 

incorporated  into  anecdotes  to  provoke  awe  in  my  peers.  Should  I  one  day 

successfully employ any of the information, tips, or techniques provided herein 

in conjunction with my spouse, I pledge that after a reasonable period of no 

longer than 24 hours I will credit it/them to Stephen Colbert. So help me God.

All right, let’s get freaky. 

As  I  mentioned,  sex  is  power—the  power  to  create  life,  the  power  to  ruin 

your life, and the power to sex it up good. If you refuse that power, you’ll be 

cheating yourself, and in my case, hundreds of lovely ladies, out of something 

very special (my penis). But even though sex can be wonderful, it can also be 

scary, like a maniac, or a haunted house—two things that happen to go great 

with sex. 

Now, before I stimulate you further, I should address a fundamental question: 

Why do we have sex? I’m on record as preaching abstinence. I talk about it 

on  my  TV  show,  elsewhere  in  this  book,  in  pamphlets  I  hand  out  on  street 

corners, and occasionally in sky-writing. But there is a proper time to have 

sex: when you want to reproduce. The body parts to which we are attracted 

are directly linked to child production and nurturing. For men, it’s the breasts 

that provide our offspring nutrition, the legs to which they cling, the lips that

kiss the babies goodnight, and the small of the back that teaches our children 

about the folly of tattoos.2 

For women, it’s the balls. Nothing the ladies love more than a big sack. I mean 

something a cartoon bandit would carry out of a bank.

have heated the blood of some of my female readers, even some of those who 

signed the abstinence pledge. Remember, you took an oath! So, here’s a little 

scripture sorbet to cool your palate. 

“It is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid  

 sexual immorality.” 

—1 Thessalonians 4:3 

Exactly. It may be Chad’s will that you chug a few wine coolers and drive up 

to  the  lake,  “’cause  it’s  really  beautiful  up  there,”  but  who  are  you  going  to 

listen to on this one: an omnipotent deity or a management trainee at Outback 

And  for  any  male  readers  who  found  my  bandit  imagery  arousing,  here  is

another passage: 

“If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have 

done what is detestable. They must be put to death.” 

—Leviticus 20:13 

This is not homophobic. 
It’s homo-cidal. 

Okay. Sexual fire quenched. Let’s move on. 

RIGHT  THERE!  Sex  is  like  the  death  penalty:  one  outcome,  so  many 

different ways of carrying it out. 

STRAIGHT  TALK:  Even  though  both  men  and  women  enjoy  sex,  they 

approach  it  very  differently.  Let’s  be  honest.  Men  think  about  sex  non-stop, 

and that’s not just a stereotype. It happens on sitcoms and in advertisements 

all the time.

I   A M   A M E R I C A   ( A N D   S O   C A N   Y O U ! )  

They even have a 
different word for it: 
“Love.” 

Women  don’t  feel  that  way  about  sex.  They  prize  emotion  over  physicality. 

They want a partner who is considerate and attentive, who will spoon them 

while reciting Keats and feed them organic yogurt by candlelight on a seaside 

cliff at sunset. 

But  here  comes  the  Women’s  Studies  Brigade,  railing  about  how  Colbert  is 

reinforcing gender stereotypes. Well, ladies, we have those stereotypes for a 

reason—a reason I can’t remember right now because I’m too busy thinking 

about  sex  more  than  you  do.  Don’t  be  a  knuckle  sandwich.  The  sooner  we 

accept the basic differences between men and women, the sooner we can stop

arguing about it and start having sex.3 

THE TAKE-ME-HOME: Treat sex like alcohol. Whether you sip it or chug it 

or have a destructive chemical dependency on it, make sure you’re in control. 

When  you  bring  that  frosty  can  of  sex  to  your  lips,  you’d  better  be  the  one 

calling the shots. One way to tell if you’re losing control is if during the past

WHEN ANIMALS ATTACK OUR MORALS 

As  you  can  see,  when  you  follow  the  rules  there  is  nothing  more  beautiful 

than  two  mature  people  who  are  in  a  committed,  loving  relationship  doing 

something unspeakably debasing. 

The key word there is “people,” because when it comes to 

doing “it” right, there is no greater threat to our democratic 

sexual values than the Animal Kingdom. Every day, scien-

tists report more species engaging in homosexual behavior, 

while cable television offers a full slate of animal sex propa-

ganda ranging from Animal Planet to Dora the Explorer.

plenty of ants already. No, the simple truth is they delight in fornicating—and 

in plain sight of human picnics, no less. I guess that’s part of the sick thrill.

I VOTE “NEIGH”: Sorry horses, but the only thing I want to see mounting 

another horse is a jockey. 

If  humans  should  be  following  anyone’s  example,  it’s  the  tiger.  Males  and 

females lead chaste, solitary existences for almost their entire adult lives, until 

the  man  decides  it’s  time  to  have  children,  spends  months  tracking  a  mate 

without her knowledge, then with a mighty roar leaps from the underbrush and 

snarls until the female performs a sexy dance. When the male is sufficiently 

entertained he bites her neck and initiates the miracle of life, I’m sure in a loving 

way.  Sometimes  the  most  beautiful,  intimate  connections  only  occur  after  a 

good, long stalking. I think it’s easy for humans, especially women, to forget 

that. And really, ladies, when’s the last time you worked on your sexy dance? 

Unfortunately,  most  of  today’s  women  resemble  bowerbirds  that  force 

suitors to build elaborate nests of twigs, leaves, and discarded garbage before 

choosing  a  mate.  Any  male  who  doesn’t  meet  her  standards  doesn’t  get  to

and watches bowerbird porn. Hey gals, not every guy is Ryan Gosling from

Even  worse  is  the  seahorse.  The  man  seahorse  shoulders  the  burden  of 

carrying  baby  seahorses  to  term.  The  seahorse  is  by  far  the  most  whipped 

animal, and by far the most frequently cited in my own marriage. 

Of  course,  you  could  also  be  a  male  octopus,  who  after  a 

lovely  evening  of  cephalopod  merriment,  gently  fills  one  of 

his arms with sperm before detaching said arm and watching 

it crawl into his life-mate’s mantle cavity. Oh, don’t worry, he 

doesn’t feel a thing BECAUSE HE’S DEAD. Remember how 

he detached part of his body? It just proves that even under

Wondering  why  you’ve  never  heard  of  these  from  the  Free-Animals’-Willies 

crowd?  Maybe  it’s  because  they  don’t  have  sex  at  all.  They  reproduce  by 

parthenogenesis, the way God intended. It’s got Genesis right there in the name. 

It’s a travesty that these reptilian paragons of morality go sorely neglected as 

high school mascots, while sex fiends like Hawks, Cougars, and Wildcats get

GUT CHECK: So far, you’ve learned everything you always wanted to know 

about sex that I was willing to tell you. Except one thing: how to get it. In olden

I had met the previous Sunday at a fraternity mixer. Back then, I was shy, and 

it had taken me all night to work up the courage to send a letter to her parents 

requesting their permission to take her out. Lucky for me, they had returned it 

with the “yes” box checked. So here I was, watching lovely Tr-cy approach the 

lane with a determined stride. Needless to say, I crushed her, 134 to 62. Women 

respond to dominance, and when I got that tenth frame spare, I knew I had

I   A M   A M E R I C A   ( A N D   S O   C A N   Y O U ! )  

Growing up, I lived in a strict household. All I knew of the opposite sex was 

what  I  read  on  my  mom’s  shampoo  bottles.  Women  cared  about  smelling 

terrific, and they liked to be made to feel soft, silky, and very shiny. While other 

kids started “petting” and “going down to petting town” as early as sophomore 

year,  I  was  a  late  bloomer.  But  I  don’t  regret  it,  because  once  I  bloomed,  I 

turned out to be just what women love: a sex flower. 

I’ll admit it: I miss my swinging bachelor days. I used to have dating down to 

a science. But now that I’ve permanently and happily hung up my single-guy 

sombrero, I’m glad to share my trade secrets with the next generation. 

I have received many 
compliments on my 
stamen.

my attic. 

FOR THE LADIES 

Dating Do’s 

First, some crucial advice: Be on your guard. You might be looking for a life 

partner, but your date’s most likely looking for a disco partner. Being cautious 

lets a man know that he’ll have to put in some effort to make your acquaintance, 

and the right kind of guy will respect you for it. That said, show some cleavage. 

It lets a man know that you’re confident enough to show some cleavage. So put 

on something that makes you feel like he’ll feel you’re sexy, and get ready to 

have fun. If you go out to dinner, let him pay. You deserve it. Plus, offering to 

pay makes you look like you’ve got money to burn. Before you know it, he’ll 

be hitting you up for loans and asking to borrow your car. I’ve done it dozens 

of times. And during the meal, order something that will get his attention, 

like a side of bacon for dessert. I can’t think of anything sexier. 

Real ladies want a Real Man. What’s a Real Man? Well, I’m a Real Man, and 

there’s  nothing  I  can  do  about  that,  even  though  some  people  want  me  to 

apologize  for  it.  Well,  no  go.  I  will  continue  treating  a  lady  like  a  lady  even 

though  it’s  enough  to  get  you  smacked  with  a  lawsuit  these  days.  My  legal 

defense team has advised me not to say more about it than that.

So, what is a Real Man, again? 

A Real Man is someone who walks through life the way a pilot walks through 

an airplane. Cool, calm, and checking out the sexy stews. No matter how tough 

the situation gets, a Real Man never lets on about the faulty landing gear. 

They’ll find out 
soon enough. 

The point is, if you want to attract the ladies, there are a few things you will 

need to know about being a man, and luckily for you, you’ve come to the right 

book. 

How to tie a bowtie 

Let’s face it—ladies like a man who looks good, and part of this means dressing 

well. In my line of work, I’m in a tuxedo all the time. It’s the Emmys one week, 

announcing a boxing match the next. But even if you’re a garbage man or you 

work at MSNBC, you’re going to want to know how to tie a bowtie. Clip-ons are 

for losers. Nothing ruins your special date night faster than having someone 

come up to you and say, “Can we get some more shrimp puffs?” 

So here’s how you do it… 

Start  with  the  left  end  a  little  longer  than  the  right  end.  That’s  your  left.  If 

someone else is tying it on you, it’s their right. If you’re left-handed, you’re on 

your own. Now, slip the short end under the long end. After that, slip the long 

end under the short end.7 Now, fold the short end into a bow shape and, holding 

that against your neck, fold the long flap over the front of the tie. There should 

be a little pocket in there. Push the rest of the tie through that. Goddamn it! 

That does not look right. Take that part of the tie out. Pinch it a little and feed 

it through there until it looks nice. Smooth out the right side. Slip a finger into 

the  left  bow.  Pull  the  left  bow  through  the  hole.  Great,  it’s  all  jumbled.  Try 

holding on to the right side. Man, this looks like shit. Let’s start again. 

Okay, grab the three layers on the right and gently pull the left bow through the 

hole. Flatten the left half of the front. That’ll have to do. 

Hint: Buy an ascot.

How to ask out a woman 

98% of the confusion in modern relationships starts right here. Be direct about 

your intentions, like this: “Good evening, (Insert Girl Name Here), would you 

be interested in going on a date and potentially bearing my children and quit-

ting your job to raise them?” They’ll appreciate your candor. Don’t fall into the 

trap of saying something like “Hey, how would you like to hang out sometime?” 

Then the girl doesn’t know if it’s a date or not. And one thing leads to another 

and the next thing you know you’re living with a woman who might just be 

If you want your first date to lead to another, follow these two simple rules. 

One, ALWAYS order for the woman. She’s wrapped up in food issues. A woman 

is afraid if she orders the entrée she’s going to look like a pig, but if she only 

gets a salad, you’ll think she’s anorexic. Take the guilt and shame away from 

her. Plus, it lets her know who’s going to be in charge in the bedroom. Two, 

don’t  do  all  the  talking.  It’s  rude.  Do  two-thirds  of  the  talking.  That’s  why  I 

keep a chess clock in my jacket pocket. 

Lower your expectations 

A  date  doesn’t  have  to  be  perfect.  You’re  not  going  to  the  barber,  for  gosh-

sakes. Are you about to meet the woman of your dreams? Probably not. So 

just think of each date as a love scrimmage to prepare you for the marriage 

playoffs. Nobody’s keeping score. But for the record, I’m winning. 

Chivalry  never  goes  out  of  style.  Open  doors;  pull  out  chairs;  offer  to  undo

THE COLBERT SHUFFLE 

FINDING THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE 

Let face it: Finding Mr./Miss Right is no picnic. 

Have you tried 
looking at a picnic? 

But where others see a problem, I see a free-market opportunity. That’s why I’ve 

set up my own dating service for the Colbert Nation. I call it ColbertCoupling. 

It’s  a  great  way  for  like-minded  heroes  like  you  to  meet  one  another,  and  it 

should be up and running at the ColbertNation.com website by the time you 

read this. [Editors note: Due to a class action lawsuit, this web service is no 

longer available.] 

My single friends say they’re frustrated with popular dating sites like eHarmony 

and  Match.com.  No  matter  how  much  they  lie  on  their  questionnaires,  they 

can’t find that special someone. The problem is that too many of these sites 

rely on touchy-feely “emotional compatibility,” when really all that matters is 

that you agree on most things. And if you’re reading this, you do agree on most 

things, which are the things I agree on, so you’ve got a head start. 

Here’s a sample of the questionnaire potential lovebirds will encounter at my 

web  portal.  Why  not  stop  by  and  give  it  a  shot?  (Especially  if  you’re  a  lady. 

Honestly, it’s kind of a sausage-fest at the moment.)

THE LOVE OF LAST RESORT 

Of course, while you’re beating the bushes for a mate, the answer might be to 

just shake the family tree. An attractive cousin might fall out.8 

Now, Nation, I have always been pro-cousin marriage. It is a great way to keep 

the bloodline pure. My own family tree is not so much a tree as it is a circle. 

Kind of looks like a tree eating itself. 

And there’s nothing wrong with it. 

Don’t believe me? Let’s ask God. He’s got some hard and fast rules 

in this area. 

Let’s see…Leviticus Chapter 18 Verse 12 – “Thou shalt not uncover the naked-

ness of thy father’s sister”…blah blah blah “thy mother’s sister”…yeech…“of 

thy father’s brother”…man there were some sick Levites…”of thy daughter-in-

law”…fair enough…“of thy brother’s wife.” Nope! Nothing about cousins. 

This is great news, because dating your cousin is only a few nucleotides away 

from dating yourself. And I don’t know about you, but I rarely get through the 

morning shave without wanting to ask myself out. Will I say yes? Who knows? 

I’ve yet to get up the courage. 

YOU  CAN’T  HURRY  LOVE—but  you  can  certainly  take  the  shortcut. 

Instead of paging through Match.com, try flipping through the family photo 

album. 

Did you know that the U.S. is the only Western country with cousin-marriage 

restrictions? Hey Congress, stay out of our bedrooms! Unless, of course, those 

bedrooms are filled with gay people. 

Gay cousins? 
Tough call.

CANARY IN A COAL MINE 

I  hope  that  the  Heroes  out  there  heed  my  advice  and  find  the  love  they 

deserve, because there are a lot of people who don’t want men and women 

to get together. They’d rather see us in constant battle, a war between the 

sexes, where the battleground is sex itself.

Case in point: Kegels.

Now, if you’re like me, when you hear the word “Kegel” you immediately 

think of the German word for ten-pin bowling, or kegeln. Well, the other day 

I was searching the Internet for news on the latest standings in the profes-

sional Kegel league and I got the shock of my life when this shocking page 

from the Mayo Clinic popped up:

Kegel exercises: 
How to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. 

Now,  I’m  not  squeamish  about  the  female,  you  know,  parts.  But  I’m  not 

about  to  go  into  detail  about  what  this  “clinic”  is  suggesting  women  do. 

Suffice  it  to  say,  they  must  want  women  to  work  out  the  muscles  down 

there for a reason of their own.

These  strengthening  exercises  are  called  “kegels”  and  are  named  for  Dr. 

Arnold M. Kegel M.D. I’ve heard of some weird fetishes, but this guy must 

have been a real sicko. 

Now, the ladies who sign on and install a Bowflex™ in their privates say that 

there are all sorts of benefits, including increased sexual pleasure for both 

partners. I’m not buying it. Hey, everyone loves a firm handshake, but who 

wants to buy a car from the salesman who crushes your hand in a death 

The worst part is that their operation is covert. Any woman could be doing 

it at any time, any place. Look around you right now. Do you see a woman?

And they got us where they want us. Might as well put a bear trap in a honey

So fellas, you’ve been warned. From here on out, every casual conquest has 

been turned into a deadly game of vaginal roulette. 

Wow, “vaginal roulette.” That was a little racy. I’m out of breath, and I’m sure 

so are some of you. Let’s take a cool shower in Matthew 5:29—“If your eye 

—even if it is your good eye—causes you to lust, gouge it out and throw it 

away.” 

I feel better already. 

STEPHEN SPEAKS FOR ME 

A  C H A N C E  FO R  AV E R AG E  A M E R I C A N S  TO  AG R E E  W I T H  W H AT  I  T H I N K  

Hey there. I’m your soul mate, the one person on this 

earth who’s perfect for you in every way. Yes, I exist, and yes, 

everyone else you’ve been with is a pale substitute. We’re meant 

to be together, but we’ve never met. 

You see, there are 6 billion people in the world and you 

encounter at most about 1,000 people per day, so statistically 

our paths would cross only once every 16,500 years. If we’re 

going to beat those odds you need to work harder, because so 

Your Soul Mate 

far you’ve done a spectacular job of messing this up. 

Remember when you bought that pack of gum and the clerk 

asked if you wanted a bag, but you were in a rush so you said no? If you’d waited that 

extra three seconds you would have missed the next train, making you late for the 

play, so they wouldn’t have let you in the theater until the first scene was over, and I 

103 

would have entered the lobby—also late—and we’d have gotten to talking. We prob-

ably would have just skipped the play and gotten coffee and then…Pow! Fifty years of 

golden summers at the lake house. 

Another example: Remember when you signed up for a yoga class? You should have 

signed up for a pottery class. I was taking a pottery class! How hard is that to figure 

out? And don’t just sign up for a pottery class next time, because I might have moved 

on to hip-hop cardio. I can’t tell you exactly where I’ll be because if you’re really my 

soul mate you’ll just know. Please just get it right. Last time, I dealt with my disappoint-

ment by sleeping with the pottery instructor. 

I guess what I’m saying is, next time you think about going to the museum today 

instead of tomorrow when I’ll be there, ask yourself: Do you really want to spend the 

rest of your life alone? Are you going to take the bus or are you going to walk? If you 

do walk and it’s raining, how are you going to see me under my umbrella, unless I don’t 

have one and you share yours, or I share mine and that’s how we meet? So remember: 

Never leave the house without an umbrella… or with one. It’s your choice. I think I 

explained pretty clearly what’s at stake. 

Are you reading this at a book store? I’m right behind you. Turn around! 

Am I still there? 

God, you’re a slow reader. 

Point is, hanging over every decision you make, however small, is the sword of 

our loneliness. I am out there. Find me. But please hurry. I know we’re meant to be 

together for eternity, but I can’t wait forever. 

Oh my God! I just ran into my pottery teacher. That’s so random.

SEXUAL ROLE-PLAY QUIZ 

Keeping a relationship fresh for years after attraction has faded takes work.  I’m talking 

about Fantasy role-playing. 

It’s a time-tested sexual super-charger that allows a couple 

to pretend in an intimate and loving way that they are making love to someone they don’t 

know.  But just because it’s naughty, doesn’t mean it’s a free for all. There are rules.  

If your 

spouse comes out of the bathroom wearing nothing but a red hood and a basket of goodies, 

you sure as hell better have a wolf head on. 

Match these other sexual fantasy players from the left column with their appropriate 

partner on the right.  Good luck!

AM  A  GAY  AMERICAN.  AND 

I 

COULDN’T  BE  GAYER  NOW  THAT 

THE  GAYS  ARE  ON  THE  RUN.  OF 

COURSE, I’M USING “GAY” THE WAY 

OUR FOUNDING FATHERS INTENDED, TO MEAN “HAPPY,” 

BEFORE IT WAS STOLEN FROM THEM BY THE GAYS, JUST 

LIKE THEY STOLE THEIR TIGHTS, WIGS, AND CODPIECES. 

Nation, we’re at War. And we can’t let the gays gain any more ground on our 

American language. Which is why we’re going to start taking their words. First 

word  we  reclaim?  “Homosexual.”  From  now  on,  it’s  going  to  mean  what  it 

always should have: heterosexual. Think about it. “Homo” means “the same.” 

And we’re all born with the same sexual orientation—straight. Ask any baby. 

If you don’t share my outrage about this, the homosexual agenda has already 

got you in its velvet grip. Want to know what its other hand is doing? Just use 

your  imagination.  You’re  probably  picturing  something  pretty  steamy,  right? 

Maybe a filthy little scenario taking place in a bathroom stall of a TGIFriday’s

little  gay  fantasy  just  proves  my  point.  Every  single  one  of  us  fights  a  daily 

battle to suppress the insurgency raging in our loins. It’s a long hard slog, and 

we’ve all had the urge to cut and run.

But  Americans  are  fighters.  We  didn’t  give  up  in  World  War  II  against  the 

Germans just because Nazism “felt good.” The homosexual agenda is nothing 

more than appeasement. They are sexual Neville Chamberlains. They want us 

to lay down our arms and pick up rainbow-colored white flags. But we can’t let 

a.k.a. 
“Richard Chamberlains” 

them win our hearts and minds with their thighs and abs. We must crush them. 

Now I’ve got nothing against gay people. I just don’t like how they flaunt it. I’m 

perfectly fine with someone choosing to be gay, as long as he marries a woman 

and has kids like the rest of us. And if he has to flaunt it, there’s a place for that: 

in the privacy of his own home. Which should be a jail cell. 

Gentrify that! 

GUT-SPEAKING: We all know that people in prison engage in homosexual 

acts, right? Which means that criminals are more likely to be homosexuals. 

So wouldn’t it save us a lot of tax dollars to simply throw all gay people in 

prison? You know, cut out the middleman. 

WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? 

The problem is, these days there are more and more positive gay role models. 

When did gays become people to look up to? What happened to the good ol’ 

stereotype of the creepy guy sneaking back and forth from the bar with no 

windows to the movie theater that doesn’t say what it’s showing? 

Turn on the TV these days and it’s a virtual Pride Parade of admirable homosex-

uals. Ellen. Melissa Etheridge. Lance Bass. All the more respectable because 

they have the courtesy to identify themselves, unlike the “Surprise Gays.” The 

SG’s are celebrities that act manly and tough, then years later, they “come out 

of the pantry,” and your friends start looking at you funny for having posters of 

them up in your weight room. All of a sudden, no one wants to spot you. 

Hey fellas, how come 
no middlewoman? 

Also, the movie was 
never in focus.

It’s not me. 

who’s about to gay surprise everybody. 

PASTE OTHER GUY 

HERE WHEN HE 

GAY SURPRISES US 

SO HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? 

Where did all these “The Gays” come from? 

Well, there are those who argue that some people are born gay. But this is 

just silly, because we are made in God’s image. So if someone were born gay, 

that would mean God is part gay, and he is definitely not. He is 100% hetero. 

God is all Man. 

And I can prove it. 

BIBLICAL ACTS THAT PROVE GOD IS NOT GAY 

It’s Amen— 
NOT “Ah, men.” 

It’s not “Hail Larry, 
Full of Grace.” 

CREATED MAN AND WOMAN: Took one of Adam’s ribs and made  

Eve. If God were gay, he would have turned Adam’s rib into Dermot  

Mulroney. 
DESTROYED THE CITY OF SODOM: He didn’t rent a summer   
cottage there, he destroyed it! 
HE TURNED MOSES’ “STAFF” INTO A “SERPENT”: If he was 

gay, it’d be the other way around. 

And it’s not “Our 
Father who art in 
Kevin.” 

TURNED WATER INTO WINE: Not Appletinis. Not Cosmos. God 

likes his booze straight and served from an animal skin. 

So I think we can put to bed this crazy idea that God is gay. 

Okay, I’m gonna roust it for a second because I think it bears repeating. He’s 

Hetero sleep 

not gay. Back to sleep, idea. 

And He certainly doesn’t believe in Gay Marriage. The institution of marriage is 

meant for a man and a woman. It’s right there in the Bible, right after God tells 

everyone to stone the gays. Nowhere does God say he wants pairs of men to be 

fruitful and multiply. If that’s what He’d wanted, He would have given gay men 

ovaries and breasts and luscious lips. But he only gave them the luscious lips.

H O M O S E X U A L S  

AND YET… 
The  biggest  threat  facing  America  today—next  to  socialized  medicine,  the   
Dyson vacuum cleaner, and the recumbent bicycle—is Gay Marriage. 

It’s like the Red Coats, Green Peace, and the Yellow Peril combined.  

I call it The Lavender Armageddon. And it is the biggest threat facing America  
today. (See above.) 

Now, the Man-Hugger huggers out there are saying, “Mary, please! What about  
the Iraq War? Surely that’s a bigger threat than Gay Marriage.” Yes, Iraq is the  
Central Front in the War on Terror© and We’re Fighting Them Over There So  
We Don’t Have to Fight Them Over Here.™ But consider this: who, other than  
terrorists, wants to destroy our way of life? The Gays. Allowing them to marry  
would be like strapping on a suicide vest with a matching cummerbund.1 

They say this. 

When I married my wife she became Mrs. Stephen Colbert. Likewise, I became  
Mr.  Stephen  Colbert.  We  went  from  being  two  autonomous  individuals  to  a   
team whose sole focus was winning the game of life. By winning, of course,  
I mean procreation. And we have won! We have procreated. And I mean no  
disrespect to those readers who have not had children. There is no shame in  
being a genetic dead end.  

Now marriage involves a lot of sacrifice. For instance, my wife frowns on me  
having sex with anyone but her. If marriage is suddenly available to everyone,  
I’m not sure I want to make those sacrifices. I guess it’s like that wise old joke:  
I don’t want to belong to any club that would have gay people as a member.2 

At one time (I believe it was 1952), acceptance of the gay lifestyle was so low  
that there were exactly two homosexuals in the continental United States. One  
was male, and one was female, so they never tried to get married. But today  
tolerance  is  at  a  dangerous  level,  and  if  it  keeps  increasing  at  current  rates,   
everyone will gay marry, and our grandchildren’s grandchildren may never be  
born. Or worse. 

They’ll be gay adopted.3 

Dinosaurs are 
extinct and more 
popular than ever! 

1  Yes, gays, I know: it’s vest or cummerbund.  Now do you see my point? 
2  Here’s another oldie but goodie: Q: Why did the gay fireman wear red suspenders? 

A: He didn’t. He wanted his pants to fall down. 

3  A quick word about gay children. And by that I mean “children of gays” rather than “children who are gay.” 
I don’t believe someone can choose to be gay until they’ve experienced either college or The Rocky Horror 
Picture Show, whichever comes first.

STEPHEN SPEAKS FOR ME 

A  C H A N C E  FO R  AV E R AG E  A M E R I C A N S  TO  AG R E E  W I T H  W H AT  I  T H I N K  

My name is Austin, and I am a reformed homosexual. 
I was only six years old the first time I chose to pervert nature.  
I was with my mother at the bike store, and I decided to feel a  
thrill of excitement when I noticed a shiny purple Schwinn with  
plastic flowers on the basket. 

From that point on, I chose to feel different from the other 

boys in my class. Until the age of twelve, I merely elected to feel 

a vague sense of not quite fitting in. But then, when puberty hit, 

Austin, 
a formerly gay man 

I resolved to be alienated from and picked on by male peers. 

I kept up this sinful pattern well into my twenties. I chose 

the urges that made my father stop talking to me; I selected 

the longings that led a group of morally stronger men to beat me up in a parking lot; I 

even picked the sense of contentment I felt during a three-year live-in relationship with 

an older man. But all that time, I knew I was living against God’s will. And so, I tried 

everything I could think of to turn straight. 

I went on dates with women. I joined a fantasy sports league. I changed the shape of 

my mustache. 

Nothing. 

called “chickpeas.” 

the true path of love. 

I even tried hormone therapy to raise my testosterone levels. All this did was make 

me go fat and bald, which, in addition to my pale skin and short stature, turned me into 

what’s known in the gay community as a “garbanzo bean.” In lesbian circles they’re 

Then one day at Hot Yoga, I saw a flier on the Community Board about a gay 

rehabilitation group called God Also Yearns. They teach that God desires us to accept 

I took the plunge and entered their proven three-part program.

 

 

 

• Accept the authority of your spiritual counselors: They not only condemned my 

wicked acts, but also sternly judged my clothing and income level.

• Admit your sins: To purge them, I wrote them down. It became a very popular blog.

• Submit to a higher power: This consisted mostly of electroshock. 

The God Also Yearns counselors said I could be completely cured if I attended 

their four-week rehabilitation camp. I could only afford a two-week course. They said 

that would also do the trick. 

They were right. At the camp, I joined in healing acts of Christian heterosexual 

fellowship such as heterosexual cookouts and heterosexual trust falls. The highlight 

of the two weeks was performing in the camp’s traditional-values version of Rent, 

called Lent. I played Wally, the Republican Senator who casts the deciding vote for 

the Marriage Protection Amendment. I’ve never clogged with such passion. 

My God Also Yearns counselors taught me that homosexuality is an addiction like 

smoking, only you can still do it on an airplane. To quit you have to go Cold Turkey, 

by imagining that your homosexual partner is a slimy, puckered, cold turkey. Unless 

you’re into “cold turkeys,” in which case you definitely need the four-week course. 

Today, I am married to a wonderful woman, Afke. I don’t hide my shameful past 

from her. During the physical act of love I will often talk about it just to remind us 

both how much better it is with a girl. 

I also call in to a number of radio shows. 

I hope my story is inspiring to any homosexuals who have bought this book not 

to read, but to carry as a signal to other homosexuals that they are willing to be 

approached and seduced. This book’s distinctive cover would make it exceptionally 

good for that, but take it from me: there is another choice.

THE FINAL THREAT 

“The greatest trick the devil ever played was 

convincing the world that he did not exist.” 

—Charles Baudelaire, French poet, and I’m going to go out on a limb here and say “gay guy” 

As gay people are increasingly integrated into society and accepted as friends 

and coworkers, there is a new threat looming on the horizon. 

The threat that we will forget to feel threatened by them. 

On this final battlefield, the greatest casualty of all may be our anger. 

TAKE SOME ACTION!

There are three simple steps you can take today to maintain your 

Next time you get cut off in traffic, say to yourself,  
“I bet that guy is gay.” 

Picture your wife cheating on you with a gay guy. 

Go to the bathroom when everyone else in the house is asleep,

If he nods, you will get angry.

“Teach your children well.”
 –David Crosby, bloated folk singer 
& notorious lesbian inseminator 

IF 

THERE’S A BIGGER CONTRIBUTOR TO 

LEFT-WING ELITIST BRAINWASHING 

THAN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, 

I’D LIKE TO SEE IT. THERE’S AN OLD 

Figure of speech. 
Don’t show it to me. 

SAYING, “A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE IS A DANGEROUS THING.” 

WHICH MEANS A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE MUST BE A REALLY 

DANGEROUS THING. AND IT IS. LOOK NO FURTHER THAN 

the example of Ted Kaczynski, a.k.a. the Unabomber. He skipped sixth 

grade,  got  a  Bachelor’s  from  Harvard  followed  by  a  Master’s  and  a  Ph.D., 

and then embarked on a distinguished academic career of blowing people up. 

Most Ph.D. biographies have similar endings. 

Ted Kaczynski’s last job before he went into full-time Unabombing? Assistant 

Professor  of  Mathematics  at  the  University  of  California,  Berkeley,  a.k.a. 

University of Blame America First, Berkeley. Yes, folks, he capped off all those 

years of being a student by becoming a professor. Let’s face it—he’d have been 

crazy not to go crazy, which only proves my point: the greatest threat facing 

America  today—outside  of  flag  burning,  yoga,  and  vaccination—is  higher 

education. 

Hey Docs! How about

Just  exactly  what  makes  colleges  so  dangerous?  It’s  the  fact  that  their 
classrooms and lecture halls are filled with a poison known as New Ideas. 

Racism, genocide, 
and bears were all  
once New Ideas. 

Unhappy kids 
can skip this part. 

New Ideas hurt Americans in two ways: 

THE EMOTIONAL COST 

Because you didn’t know anything. 

The more you know, the sadder you get. 

Let me ask you this: why were you happier were when you were a kid? 

Don’t Believe Me? By the time you finish reading this chapter, over a hundred 

dogs and cats in animal shelters around the nation will have been euthanized.

Don’t know if 
this is true 

Bet you wish you could erase that knowledge. But it’s too late. You learned a 

New Idea, and it made you sad. College is just more of the same. 

THE PHYSICAL COST 

Pain is the body’s way of telling the brain it’s in trouble. Similarly, confusion is 

the brain’s way of telling the body, “All right, buddy, drop that book.” 

Let’s try a little experiment. Look at this equation: 

-b+  bB - 4ac
2a 
What you’re feeling right now is your body rejecting an idea that is trying to

make you learn it. Don’t fight the confusion. That’s just your mind scabbing 

over in a desperate attempt to protect you from that unnatural co-mingling of 

Numbers and letters?  numbers and letters up there. You can’t add it, and you can’t read it. Useless. 
That’s a “Catch-22!” 

GUT-CHECK: 

Son of Sam killer David Berkowitz was a well-adjusted 

member of society until his neighbor’s dog started filling his head with 

a bunch of New Ideas. 

While it’s true that you encounter New Ideas in colleges and universities, they 

aren’t the real problem. Some of the buildings are nice, and the lawns are quite 

lush. It’s what infests these hives of higher learning that is the source of the

I’m talking about Academics. 

Not a day goes by without a news of some anti-American statement made by a 

lunatic in a mortar board and elbow patches. 

HERE’S A QUESTION: Elbow patches? Just what are these lecherous 

lecturers doing behind their lecterns that wears out their elbows so fast? 

I’ve got twenty-year-old suits, and the elbows are pristine. 

Why  can’t  we  fire  these  “edu-bators”?  These  men  and  (all  too  frequently)  “edu-bator” 

women who actually give credit for learning a foreign language?  Because of  2007

a  little  thing  called  tenure.  Well,  I  have  a  modest  proposal  for  changing  all 

that.  Doctors  don’t  get  tenure.  Plumbers  don’t.  Can  you  imagine  if  baseball 

players got tenure, and we had to sit there watching them round the bases in 

a wheelchair? 

I propose that we do away with tenure on campus once and for all and replace it 

with a series of clear-cut requirements for professors. In no particular order: 

I can imagine this. 

Actually, in this 
particular order. 

Cognitive skills test: Prospective faculty can demonstrate mental  
competence by memorizing a small passage of text, say, a secret   
loyalty oath.

idea from an old World War II movie about a squadron that had been   I may have dreamt it. 

infiltrated by a spy. I can’t actually answer this question myself, but  

I’m not the one whose patriotism is in question. 
Penmanship: Can a professor legibly write a brief paragraph?  
For instance, a secret loyalty oath? 
Eat a bug: Prove you love your country as much as the contestants 
on Fear Factor. 
Public speaking: Can the faculty member enunciate the secret  
loyalty oath when they are called upon to do so by a tribunal? 
Good-faith attempts at heterosexuality: Prospective professors  
would be required to produce evidence of at least five years’ worth  
of heterosexual congress. (I’m open-minded. I don’t say you must be   
straight to teach our youth. I only ask that you try.)

FROM BAD TO WORDS 

Told you it was
 coming back 

The easiest way for college professor “bees” to administer their “idea poison”

is through their “thought-stingers,” commonly called “books.” 

WAKEUP CALL: Think books aren’t scary? Well, think about this: 

You can’t spell “Book” without “Boo!” 

The  only  good  book  is  the  Good  Book.  Come  on,  the  word  “Good”  is  right 

there in the title. And if there’s one thing you can learn from the Bible, it’s that 

books are responsible for the Fall of Man. Look at the story of Adam and Eve. 

Their lives were pretty great—until they ate fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. 

Now, you don’t have to be a biblical scholar to see that the fruit clearly repre-

sents  a  book.  First,  both  come  from  a  tree.  Second,  if  my  first  point  didn’t 

convince you, I’m not going to waste my breath with another. 

God’s point: Ignorance isn’t just bliss, it’s Paradise. 

Unfortunately, Paradise is Lost, and Ignorance may no longer be an option. The 

Sad Truth is Knowledge has become a racket, and these days it’s nearly impos-

sible for the uneducated to break into the world of highly paid professionals. 

Doctors and lawyers (even some dentists) have to go college. So to live in the 

gated communities to which you’d like to become accustomed, you’ve got to 

play ball. College Ball.

First off, if you’re going to squander your youth in the Ivory Jungle, at least 

shoot  for  the  Top  Schools.  They  provide  something  the  best  firms  look  for,

for the rest of your life. 

The ultimate goal of going to a Top School is the quiet satisfaction of whipping 

out your Alma Mater at opportune moments. At first blush, most would peg me 

as an average Joe, and I’m proud of that. But my sheepskin announces to all

Also, love-tester machines. No way I’m a “Cold Fish.” 

I’m at least a 
“Pretty Spicy.” 

There’s an entire industry in this country devoted to getting kids into college. 

And while you may not need Kaplan’s or The Princeton Review to get into a 

decent school, you should pay for them anyway. We live in a capitalist society. 

Love it or leave it. 

Applying  to  college  teaches  youngsters  résumé-building,  a.k.a.:  lying.  Here’s 

how it works, kids. Let’s say one day you’re bored in class, so to pass the time, 
you make out with the Danish exchange student across the aisle. Now, on your  “Hands” Christian

There are two secrets that make this essay great. 

Secret number one: A Thesaurus. Eggheads love the words, so the more you 

jam in there, the better. Think of it as a verb sausage. 

Secret number two: The last sentence. All it takes is a little research, and you 

can find the campus library, dormitory, or stadium that most plausibly could 

have been donated by your family. You’d be surprised how rarely these folks 

check into your background if you show up to the interview wearing an ascot.

while your high school rival is going to his safety school.

NOW WHAT? 

When you get to college you’ll be on your own, maybe for the first time in your 

life. You will soon learn that peer pressure is a terrible thing. You’re going to be 

tempted to go follow the crowd—into a classroom. Fight it. Because there’s no

I might have a shot at an honorary doctorate there—and I found that I could 

reduce the pertinent content of every class into one sentence. I didn’t include 

graduate classes, because if you’re even considering an advanced degree, I’ve 

already lost you.

Now you that you have your education covered, what will you do with all that 

free time? Well, luckily, college is good for one thing. Can you guess what it is? 

I’ll give you a hint: it starts with “secret” and ends with “societies.” 

Whether  they  be  Fraternities  or  Eating  Clubs  or  (in  Louisiana)  Parishes, 

universities are the best places a young man can meet and bond with, through 

an elaborate hazing process, those who can give him a leg up for the rest of 

his life. 

turntable. 

I cemented my lasting relationships with America’s future movers and shakers 

by being forced to strip naked with half my fellow pledges and pass a greased 

45  rpm  record  of  Foreigner’s  “Hot  Blooded”  from  ass  crack  to  ass  crack.  It 

could have been worse. The other half of the pledges were passing a greased 

Still played post-crack. 
Let’s see an MP3 
do that. 

In your face, 
whoever’s 
in charge of China! 

Don’t believe me? While most of his peers at Yale were writing essays about 

the tension between stasis and dynamism in Mariana in the Moated Grange, 

young George W. Bush was making the connections that would eventually lead 

to him becoming the most Powerful Man in the World.™ 

I speak, of course, of Skull and Bones, a shadowy organization that admits 

only  the  most  deserving  Yalesmen.  Its  members  swear  an  oath  of  secrecy, 

and use their wealth and access to power to promote one another once they 

graduate into the “real world.” For well over a century, Skull and Bones has 

provided  a  safe  and  brotherly  environment  where  future  Supreme  Court 

Justices,  Presidents,  and  Captains  of  Industry  can  gather  to  urinate  on 

Geronimo’s bones. 

THE TAKEAWAY: Contrary to what you’ll be taught in college, evolution 

is a farce, but Darwin did have one good idea: Social Darwinism. You see, 

in the animal kingdom, God grants long life to whichever lion He thinks is 

prettiest. But in the world of human society, only the strongest, boldest, 

and worthiest individuals have the most sex, get the most power, and live 

the longest. College is the place to meet those people, and once you do, 

find out their darkest secret. 

It may come in handy some day. 

It probably involves 
their suitemate…and 
some New Ideas!

A  C H A N C E  FO R  AV E R AG E  A M E R I C A N S  TO  AG R E E  W I T H  W H AT  I  T H I N K  

March the 13th, this two thousand and seventh year of what 

some may consider Our Lord. 

I am Doctor Bernard Brunner, distinguished professor at 

a well-known and esteemed liberal arts university. Some may 

query, “Of what are you scholarly?” Tragically, even I am not 

quite certain of that which is my endeavor. It ends in –ology?  

I am certain only of this—that life is fleeting and that much 

of my own has been wasted within the confines of small rooms 

Doctor Bernard Brunner 
Distinguished Professor 

and even smaller minds. I have spooled the thread of my life 

arguing meaningless rhetorical questions with unformed, 

untried brains and vainly pressing nimble, young flesh into service. 

Oh, to feel the biting wind on my face. To wake in the early, still dark morn and milk 

a barn full of swelled cows. Or perhaps to live in the rough city, grasping steel work 

parts in my hard-calloused hands, the merit badge of the working man! 

But alack, harsh fate has decreed that none of these paths will be mine. For I have 

tenure, and she is far too comforting a mistress to loose me from her grasp for long. 

I lay in her arms and suck from her teat, fat and oily. 

And here I sit. And here I shall sit. 

And like a sneaky merman singing on the rocks, I try to lure young sailors away 

from the charted waters to a harsh and certain doom. Plug your ears, and though you 

be young, be wise! Listen not to me, and distrust me upon first sight! I will trap you in 

the learnings of the past. Look to the future! Away! Good sea!   

You must live to learn. Pray live. Whilst I, like all unnecessary things, do but 

shrivel… 

Dry out… And turn to dust. 

With the most sincere of wishes, 

Dr. Bernard Brunner, Ph.D.

NEWS ON THE MARCH! 

The Time: The 1930s. 
The Scene: Hollywood!  
Fresh-faced hopefuls from around the nation stream to Los Angeles  
with dreams of becoming the next “Steamboat Willie.”  

THAT’S  RIGHT:  There  was  once  a  “Golden  Age”  of  Hollywood.  It  was  so-

called because the original studio heads were the children of gold prospectors 

who settled in California, struck it rich, and then converted to Judaism. 

Back  then,  movies  worked.  Whether  they  were  “talkies,”  “soundies,”  or  the 

short-lived “loudies,” the films of the Golden Age had one thing in common 

that made them timeless classics: corporate hegemony. From the crank on the 

cameras to the films’ shipping canisters to the dusty hat on the wrinkled old 

usher with the air of defeat, the “Big Five” studios owned every dimension of 

moviemaking. They even owned the stars. 

Studios  would  pluck  promising  young  actors  from  obscurity,  and  with  a

Uth,  Devourer  of  Souls)  got  more  than  just 

starring  roles  in  the  hit  movies  of  their  day. 

They got firm moral guidance. Women could 

not  appear  in  public  without  their  makeup. 

Homosexual  men  could  not  appear  without 

their  “beards.”  Beardless  heterosexual  men 

could not appear without their “mustaches.”

As you can see, for a while, everything was dandy-dory in “The City of Angels.” 

But  guess  who  shows  up  to  crash  the  party  and  ruin  it?  You  guessed  it— 

The Supreme Court. 

Did you guess it?

 Yes
No 

(Cut along line and 
keep in wallet) 

On May 4, 1948, the Supreme Court ruled that the Big Five studios had violated 

U.S. antitrust laws and set off a process that led to their dissolution. Ten days 

later, the State of Israel was proclaimed. Coincidence? 

I believe so. 

ONCE  AGAIN:  The  old  adage  proved  true:  “The  Supreme  Court  hates 

America.”  Suddenly,  it  was  no  longer  okay  for  studios  to  force  their  female 

leads to take diet pills or copulate with rams. 

And talk about hypocrisy! In 1952, the Supreme Court made another “ruling.” 

This time, it was that movies were protected by the First Amendment! That’s 

right,  just  four  years  after  they  criminalized  Hollywood’s  free  market,  they 

upheld Hollywood’s free speech! Which is it, Supreme Court? Are “free” things 

Ewe!

were for kings!

you couldn’t. 

Tragically, the 1952 First Amendment decision all but killed off the Production 

Code, the industry’s guidelines for keeping movies moral. It was like the Bill of 

Rights, only for movies, and instead of saying what you could do, it said what 

THE PRODUCTION CODE: 
SO LONG, FAREWELL, AUFWIEDERSEHEN, GOODBYE 
The  Motion  Picture  Production  Code  of  1930,  often  called  the  “Hays  Code” 

because that’s what it forbade onscreen couples from rolling in, was a strict set 

of guidelines meant to ensure that motion pictures set a positive example. It 

was created to curb the corrupting influence of movies like The Bathing Kuties 

of ’28 and Gangbang Dames of ’29. The Code took effect on March 31, 1930, 

five months too late to prevent the Wall Street Crash, but early enough to keep 

The Sixties from happening until approximately 1964. The Hays Code is gone 

now, but a look back at some of its clauses shows how much we have lost.

CODE OF CONDUCT (cont.) 

657. A man and a woman must never be shown lying in the same bed, unless it has  
been previously established that one of them is dead. 

658. Lascivious dancing shall be prohibited unless it is performed by dusky  
native girls. Dusky native girls shall be prohibited unless they are portrayed  
by white actresses. 

659. Cannibalism shall not be portrayed or implied, unless hunger first drives 
the  cannibalistic  character  to  visualize  his  victim  as  an  enormous  roast 
chicken. 

660. Seduction and rape are never proper subjects for comedy. Copping a feel 
shall be considered on a case-by-case basis. 

661. Characters may not walk and chew gum at the same time. 

662. Scenes of childbirth, in fact or in silhouette, are never to be presented.  
The same restriction applies to rabbits being pulled from hats. 

663. If a character places a folded towel over a second character's eyes and  
then invites him to do a sit-up while a third character removes his pants and  
squats in such a manner that the sit-up will bring the second character's nose  
into contact with the third character's naked nether sphincter, this action  
must  be  followed  by  a  fourth  character,  preferably  a  member  of  the  clergy, 
expressing disapproval. 

664. Characters must never discuss the high suicide rate among dentists in a  
manner that implies they “have it coming.” 

665. If a scene includes a train entering a tunnel, the tunnel shall not be  
portrayed as enjoying it. 

667. Should it be necessary to the story for a character to burp, sneeze and  
pass gas at the same time, the action must result in death. 

668. If the story calls for an animal character such as Lassie or Rin Tin Tin  
to save a child’s life, the reward may not be “a free ride on Timmy's leg.” 

670. For Christ's sake, somebody put a bra on Jean Harlow.

By  1968,  the  Production  Code  was  no  more.  But,  sorry  Supreme  Court,  its 

death wasn’t excessive, lustful, or perverted. 

Fittingly, it went out 
without a “bang.” 

FUN FACT: If we still had the Hays Code, they could never have 

made The DaVinci Code! 

For  your  moral  convenience,  you  can  use  this  book  as  an  improvised 

Production Code.

Don’t cut here 

Just cut along the line and watch movies made after 1968 through the hole.

A WORD ON CENSORSHIP: The creative class says it’s unconstitutional, 

but I advocate censorship. It’s my First Amendment right to do so. They 

want you to believe censorship hinders creativity. Hogwash. Just the 

opposite! Take foul language. It’s easy for a lazy screenwriter to put the 

words “fuck you, cocksucker” into a character’s mouth, but the artist who 

translates that phrase for an airing on prime time television or a transcon-

tinental flight is forced to come up with the much more interesting “flip 

you, cod bucket!” I ask you, which is more “creative”? 

NEWS ON THE MARCH! 

The Time: The 1950s. America loves Ike! 

The scene: Washington! Cheese-fed senators from the Heartland 

lead a desperate fight to keep Communist sympathizers from writing 

“I Remember Mama.” 

Luckily, the Golden Age of Hollywood was followed by an even Goldener Age, 

the Age of the Blacklist. Patriotic Americans secretly denounced Hollywood’s 

most dangerous Fellow Travellers to America’s House Un-American Activities 

Committee, led by American hero Joe McCarthy. America. 

MY TURN: One of my greatest regrets is that I never got the opportunity to 

“name  names.”  And  I  would  have  named  enough  names  to  fill  the  Moscow 

phone book. 

Luckily, I do have the opportunity to rename some names that were named 

all those years ago. So, here they are, a collection of blacklisted Hollywood 

comrades who were stopped from destroying our nation right in the nick of 

time. Most of the charges never added up to anything more than whispers and 

innuendo,  but  in  Hollywood,  whispers  and  innuendo  are  accepted  as  truth.

Like any great era, the glorious days of the Blacklist had to end, but instead of 

spawning a new, Goldenest Age, Hollywood handed the keys to the kingdom 

to a generation of director-rebels fresh from Film School. 

Once  again,  Higher  Education  took  a  perfectly  decent  slice  of  Americana, 

threw it to the ground and had its way. (Read Chapter 8 – at your own risk!) 

Your  Scorseses,  your  Coppolas,  and  a  few  non-Italian  directors  turned 

Hollywood on its ear in the name of a gritty, “realistic” style of filmmaking.4 

Movies, once fantastic dreamscapes where cowboys fought Indians and gay 

men  kissed  Elizabeth  Taylor,  became  squalid  nightmares  where  cowboys 

turned tricks and hillbillies kissed Ned Beatty. 

Tip 10%  
(unless they cut your  
steak into tiny pieces  
for you) 

These  new  Frank  Crapras  wanted  to  be  “important.”  To  regular  folks  like 

you and me, “important” is remembering to tip before tax and not putting tin 

foil in the microwave. To Hollywood, “important” means picking an issue no 

one  cares  about  and  making  it  a  movie.  Well,  guess  what?  The  Golden  Age 

of movies tackled their fair share of “difficult issues.” I can think of several 

memorable films that tackled the difficult issue of how to get a large number 

of women to fall into a pool like dominos. 

Just  because  these  days  a  few  Hollywood  elites 

decide some issue is “important” enough to make 

a  movie  out  of,  why  do  I  have  to  suffer  through

guy shot bad-guy-monster-bugs with lasers in space. Four stars!

Somewhere  along  the  line,  these  A-list  A-holes  confused  “box  office”  with 

“running for office.” Hey  Celebrities! Just because 20 million people went 

to see your movie, that doesn’t mean 20 million people 

care  about  your  opinions!  Your  job  is  to  distract  us 

from the horrors of the world, not to call our attention 

to them! We just want to be entertained. We want you 

to make us laugh, or cry, or worry if two cheerleaders 

from such different backgrounds can ever bridge their

stand up for This Land of Ours, at least be consumed 

by some inner demons. Snort glue. Make a sex tape. Spiral out of control in a 

headline-grabbing way until you’re wandering toothless through Malibu back-

yards or telling Larry King that you speak in a musical birdlike tongue to the 

alien beings that visit you at night in the form of vibrating bands of color on 

your bedroom wall. This is very entertaining while also being a cautionary tale 

for our children.

So  now that you know  what’s wrong with  Hollywood, let me ask you 

a Question. If someone screwed off the top of your head, scooped out your 

brain and filled your skull with garbage, would you fight back? You bet your 

screw-top head you would. 

IT’S A CULTURE WAR—TIME TO STRIKE BACK! 

Unlike Paul Newman, who seems to think that salad dressing is the cure-all for 

America’s ills, I’m a man of action. Here are a few simple steps you can take to 

end the stranglehold that the Entertainment industry has on our need for being 

entertained. 

Boycott!  Cut  them  off  from  your  money.  But  just  as  importantly,  cut  their 

message off from your eyes. Immediately stop consuming all entertainment. 

This  means  TV,  radio,  movies,  music,  video  games,  magazines,  newspapers, 

books, cell phone ringtones, the backs of cereal boxes, Bazooka Joe wrappers, 

riddles on Dixie Cups, fortune cookies, novelty t-shirts, and seafood restaurant 

placemats. Boredom will be your greatest enemy, so make your own fun. Time 

was a family could get a wonderful evening out of some sheet music and an 

egg timer. Bonus: You’ll be an empty-nester years earlier than your friends. 

Switch to Christian entertainment! For every corrupt Hollywood influence 

there’s a life-affirming Christian equivalent. For instance, instead of rotting my 

mind with the mindless violence of a game like “Grand Theft Auto,” I play “Left 

Behind: Eternal Forces.” That way, I know every enemy I kill goes directly to 

Hell. 

Write  letters!  Let  the  child-poisoners  know  that  you’re  keeping  an  eye  on 

them. Write them e-mails on an hourly basis to tell them how offensive you 

find  the  movies  you’re  not  seeing.  It’s  amazing  how  easy  it  is  to  make  “I’m 

praying for you” sound like a threat. 

I’m praying for you. 

Go  camping! Drop off the grid and get away from the corroding influences 

of the debased culture and return to nature, preferably to Idaho with a group 

of like-minded patriots, their child brides, and a cache of weapons. You never 

know  when  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and  Firearms  is  going  to  show  up  and  try  to 

make you watch Capote. 

Truman?

If all else fails pull the old switcheroo and: 

Consume  everything!  Totally  immerse  yourself  in  the  filth  of  pop  culture  to 

build a callus on your soul. It’s like when my Dad caught me with cigarettes 

when I was twelve and forced me to finish an entire carton of Kools. Worked 

like a charm. Haven’t smoked a menthol since.

If you don’t think Hollywood has tricks up its sleeve, maybe you should get

A  C H A N C E  FO R  AV E R AG E  A M E R I C A N S  TO  AG R E E  W I T H  W H AT  I  T H I N K  

Here’s a joke for you: 

A man walks into a bar. The bartender says, “What will it be, 

Mac?” The man looks at the drink menu and says, “How ’bout a 

revolution of the proletariat?” 

Zing! I wrote that one for Dinah Shore back in 1954. 

You see, I used to be a comedy writer, and like many 

comedians during the ’50s, there was nothing I wanted more 

than to use my jokes to overthrow the government and replace 

it with a classless Communist society.  

It all started when I was a kid. I remember sitting in the 

movie house watching The Three Stooges, hearing everyone 

Mort Sinclair, 
Former TV Comedy 
Writer, Communist 

laugh, and thinking to myself, “I know what I want to do. Undermine the capitalist 

system and replace it with collective farms.” 

Quick! A man and his wife are lying in bed. The wife says, “Honey, why don’t you 

roll over here and kiss me?” The man says, “I would, but I’m shackled by my capitalist 

oppressors!” Hot-cha! 

The first job interview I had was with Milton Berle. I’ll never forget what he said to 

me after reading my joke packet: “Good material, kid, but I think you can inject more 

references to the industrial class structure.” 

And he was right. Only three of my jokes mentioned the evils of private owner-

ship. That’s comedy gold!  To me the perfect joke didn’t end with a laugh, but with an 

agonizing reappraisal of the worker’s suppression by the entrenched plutocrats. 

It’s funny because it’s true. 

Of course, my career as a TV comedy writer wasn’t always easy. But whenever 

things got rough, I’d remind myself that if my jokes got just one person to sell nuclear 

secrets to the Russians, then it was all worth it. 

I’ll leave you with this joke I wrote for Sid Caesar: 

“President Truman is like Communist ideology. No class.” 

Za-bang!

MY AMERICAN MATURITY 

In  1997,  I  was  made  the  anchor  of  the  Channel  7  News  on  WPTS  Patterson 
Springs, North Carolina. I got promoted after I narced out the previous anchor, 
Wayne Colt, for his coke addiction and won a local Emmy for my investigative 
report, “Anchor Away: The Tragic Downward Spiral of Wayne Colt.” 

I was getting too big for Patterson Springs (Pop. 620), so that fall I sent out 
a reel of my best reports: “From Wayne to Worse: The Continuing Struggles 
of  Wayne  Colt,”  “Wayne  Damage:  The  Hidden-Camera  Footage  Wayne  Colt 
Begged Me Not to Show You,” “Wayne, Wayne Go Away: Living in Fear of a 
Former Colleague,” and “Never the Wayne Shall Meet: My Restraining Order 
Against Wayne Colt, Coke Fiend.” 

I immediately got a call from The Daily Show. I had made it to the Big Time, 

so I moved to the Big City and bought the Big House. 

Now I had real responsibilities. If something goes wrong with your house, 
it’s your problem. And boy, can things go haywire. There’s electricity and fuse 
boxes  and  three-prong  outlets.  It’s  like  living  in  the  Space  Station.  No  one 
warned me that life would involve science, except my science teacher. But, of 
course, he’s going to say that. He’s got a job to protect. 

Four months after moving in, I noticed that the yard looked terrible. When 
we did the final walk-through, the lawn was beautiful. Now the grass was waist 
high and shaggy. Had I been sold a bill of goods? I faced the problem like a man 
and I called my lawyer. 

He called a landscaper. 
Now  I  knew  a  lot  of  yard  guys  were  illegal  immigrants—Blue-Collar 
Banditos  stealing  manual  labor  jobs  away  from  Americans  who  had  moved 
onto something less strenuous. So I let them do the lawn, then asked to see 
their green cards. They didn’t have any, so I went inside and called INS. When 
Los Federales rolled up, I shouted from the window, “Enjoy mowing Mexico!” 
It  was  an  ugly  scene.  Turns  out,  they  didn’t  have  green  cards  because 
they were all Americans. In fact, African-Americans. I explained that I don’t 
see  Race.  On  that  subject,  I  am  very  enlightened—and  equally  endarkened. 
Eventually, everything was smoothed over with some sizeable tips to the land-
scapers, and to the cops. 

I  tell  this  story  to  illustrate  the  issues  we  all  face  as  American  Adults.  I 
call  them  the  four  Ss  and  one  M  of  Maturity:  Socioeconomics,  Segregation, 
Science, Sombreros, and the Media.

Past

The  beauty  of  new  media  is  that  no  evidence  is  necessary.  The  brave  blog -
troopers  have  stormed  the  cockpit  of  news,  and  wrested  the  joystick  of   
authority  away  from  the  seasoned  pilots  of  the  press  who  would  land  our   
country at Facts International Airport. Now there’s fresh blood at the controls,  
without any of the preconceived notions of the rudder-and-flaps crowd. 

This  is  the  age  of  the  open-source  encyclopedia.  Words  like  “research”  and   
“corroborated” now mean whatever the majority says they mean. Personally,  
I’m voting for “research” to mean “speculation” and “corroborated” to mean “a  
zesty sour cream-based dip.”  

Example: 
Recent  research  indicates  that  Barack  Obama’s  ties  to  Al  Qaeda  have  been

Hi! I’m Amy! 

To be honest, I don’t watch much TV news. The 24-hour 

cable stations focus too much on garbage I don’t want my kids 

to see. And what with working as a cashier at ShopCo, I don’t 

have time to read a newspaper. So, I mostly get my news from 

Time

and Newsweek and Modern Bride and the other news 

weeklies on the rack. A glance at their covers is all I need to 

keep me in touch with what’s going on in the world. 

And let me tell you, it is a mess. Just look at Iraq. “Can We 

Win?” Or “Is It Too Late to Win the War?” I guess it all depends 

on “How Soon We Can Get Out.” “Looking for a Way Out” is part 

Amy Anatoly  
Canton, Ohio 

of “The Way Out,” but we can’t forget there are “6 Ways to Fix It” and 

“75 Ways to Make Your Wedding Fabulous!” I think everybody over there just needs to 

“Stress Less, Relax More” and “Have Vacation Sex Without Leaving Home!” 

Plus, from what I gather, “The Search for Historical Jesus” is going no better than 

“The Search for the Real Jesus” or even “The Search for Jesus.” And until we find 

Jesus, “The Search for Mary” seems like jumping the gun. 

Of course, we’ve got problems here at home, too. I have to wonder, “Toxic Toys? 

Are Kids Safe?” For that matter, “Are Kids Too Wired For Their Own Good?” “Do Kids 

Have Too Much Power?” “Are We Giving Kids Too Many Drugs?” But, most impor-

tantly, “Do We Care About Our Kids?” 

One thing’s for sure. We should all “Be Worried. Be Very Worried.” Especially 

because, even though our brains are “Wired for Worry,” no one really knows “Why We 

Worry About the Wrong Things.” “Is Anything Safe?” 

It gets so bad that some days, the only thing that gives me hope is that “Space 

Tourism May Be Closer Than You Think!” 

Well, that’s my break. Gotta get back to the Express Lane. Lotta pressure. 

See you “Inside the iPhone!”

about Class. 

WHAT  IS  CLASS?  Class is a way of looking at society that divides people 

into different categories based on how much money they’re willing to make. 

England has 2: 
Cockneys and 
Guv’ners. 

BY THE NUMBERS: Every society has its own class structure with a unique 

number of classes. France has five: Les Aristocrats, Les Bourgeoisie, Les 

Petit-Déjeuners,  Les  Grand  Mal,  and  Les  Moonves.  India  has  one  of  the 

most rigid and complex class structures. Based upon their behavior in past 

lives, all Indians are born into different stratas of society called “castes.” 

These castes forever determine what level of tech support questions they 

are allowed to answer.

the fence. 
We’re at War. Pick

We in America have three classes: Upper, Middle and Lower. 

When I was growing up, we were in the Lower, and today, I’m in the Upper. 

SO WHICH CLASS ARE YOU? 

Ever have a nagging suspicion that you’re poor? I know my staff does. And 

that’s one of the reasons I devised this handy “Know Your Class” chart.

As a pundit, it’s my job to fight for the little guy. In terms of the percentage of 

population, that means the Upper class. But all Americans are important to 

me. I won’t be satisfied until everyone is in the top one percent. 

See, we’re lucky here in America. We live in a free market society. Think of 

it as a ladder. No matter what rung you’re born on, you have the exact same 

opportunity as everyone else to get to the top. Sure, you might say that some 

folks have less distance to climb than others, or that many of the lower rungs 

are slippery because they’re covered with garbage and your high school didn’t 

have an AP Ladder Climbing class, and the rung right above you is out of order 

and your landlord keeps saying he’s going to fix it but he never does and all the 

while the guy who hangs out on the corner of your rung is constantly trying to 

get you high, and you’re wondering if maybe you could get a little help up this 

ladder? Well, Mister, all the help you need is at your fingertips, if your finger- 

tips are touching your ankles. I’m talking about bootstraps.

own way, they’d rather go on welfare, and the liberals are more than happy 

to give it to them. 

Now,  I’m  not  the  smartest  knife  in  the  spoon,  so  explain  this  to  me.  We’re 

supposed  to  help  folks  out  of  poverty  by  giving  them  a  financial  reward 

for being poor? Doesn’t add up. If being poor is a never-ending money party, 

where’s the incentive to get rich? 

Answer  me  this:  what’s  going  to  help  a  shiftless  vagabond  more,  a  page

AT  THIS  POINT:  You’re  probably  wondering  why  I  titled  this  chapter 

“Combat of the Class Commandos: The Coming Cashpocalypse.” My editor 

may  have  changed  it  to  something  else.  But  he’ll  regret  it.  Publishing  101: 

Alliteration sells books. (I spent hours trying to make that rule alliterative, 

but it’s impossible.) 

GUT SPEAKING: Now some people might say it’s callous not giving food 

stamps to poor people. They would say it’s just another example of class 

warfare.  Well,  there  is  no  class  war  in  this  country.  The  Upper  class  has 

such a tactical advantage that if the Lower class makes a sudden move we’ll 

have a class massacre. 

If  you  ask  me,  the  Upper  class  shows  admirable  restraint.  They  could  easily 

freeze out the poor and man their factories with robots or mice. Instead, they 

offer them the opportunity for a decent wage, and up to two bathroom breaks. 

But  do  folks  in  the  Lower  classes  respond  with  even  a  simple  gesture  of 

gratitude like giving up a decent wage and one of those bathroom breaks? No. 

Instead, they form unions, which they use to bully our nation’s factory owners 

with walkouts, strikes, and that one Sally Field movie where she plays a labor 

organizer with sixteen personalities.

Now  at  first  I  thought  this  was  just  another  buzz-shackle  attempt  by  the 

envious hippie nut-jobs who can’t afford a new car every season because 

chaining yourself to a maple tree doesn’t pay what it used to in the 60s. 

But then it hit me: something more insidious was going on here. Who spends 

a lot of time breathing in that new-car smell? The Upper Class. 

Who’s  loading  those  cars  up  with  toxic  chemicals?  Factory  Workers.

colors live in perfect harmony. 

But it hasn’t always been that way. 

Once upon a time, racism was a terrible problem in this country,1 and it’s still a 

subject you’re supposed to handle delicately.2 Sorry, folks, that’s not my style. 

I’m not actually sorry. 

I’m not afraid to disturb the skeletons in America’s closet, no matter what race 

those skeletons are. (You can tell by measuring the eye-teeth.) 

I’m going to talk about race, and I’m not taking any racial prisoners. 

NOT slaves 

WHERE DID RACISM COME FROM? 

Well, before the Civil War, skin color didn’t matter, because all black people 

were slaves. But then after they were freed that name “slave” didn’t really fit 

anymore,  so  former  slaves  started  calling  themselves  “Black”  or  “Negro”  or

“colored.” 3 In short, skin began to matter, and, folks, racism was off to the races. 

Suddenly, the world was divided. White people had their drinking fountains, 

and Black people had their drinking fountains. White people had their schools, 

and Black people had their drinking fountains.4 

After  about  a  hundred  years  of  this,  a  very  smart  man  named  Dr.  The 

Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech and said, “I have a dream that 

this should end!” 

And it did.5 

May vary on a 
block-by-block basis 

Racism no longer exists in America. 

Museum gift shop

sleep mask. 

Don’t  believe  me? Down in Selma, Alabama, they recently opened up The 

National  Civil  Rights  Museum.  It’s  all  about  the  fight  against  racism.  Well, 

folks,  it  stands  to  reason  that  you  don’t  open  a  museum  for  something  that 

still exists. Case in point: the Air and Space museum. Once we “landed on the 

moon,”  Air  and  Space  was  over.  Scotchguard  Neil  Armstrong  and  hang  him 

from the ceiling. 

But  even  though  racism  is  over,  for  many  people,  sadly,  race  still  exists.  As 

long as any part of that word still lingers, we’re all in trouble. So, how do we 

erase Race? 6 Let me tell you how I did it. 

NEWS FLASH: I don’t see race.7 

THIS JUST IN: I used to see race. 

Caught your breath yet? I’ll say it again. 

I. Used. To. See. Race. In fact, I used to see it everywhere. I was very good at it, 

if I’m to believe what people shouted at me. 

My struggle 

But all that changed the day I read Ralph Ellison’s thought-provoking novel 

Invisible  Man.  I  found  myself  deeply  moved  by  his  tale  of  a  black  scientist 

who, through no fault of his own, becomes invisible and is driven mad. 

172  3  I’m pretty sure there are other terms, but my publicist insists that there aren’t. 

4  The stereotype ends now. Black people DO NOT drink more water than other races. 
5  With the help of Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney. 
6  eRace is a registered trademark of Stephen Colbert’s web-based diversity program. 
7  In the same way I assume that everybody is White, I assume that every traffic light is green. 
   This sort of  positive thinking gets me home 15 minutes sooner. 

R A C E  

Reading Invisible Man made me realize something very important: If you’re 

invisible, it means you’re the same color as air. And air has no color. Then it hit 

me: If race is no longer to divide us, our races all need to be invisible! 

So,  maybe  until  that  great  day  when  all  humans  can’t  see  color,8  those  with 

darker  skin  should  take  the  Invisible  Man’s  brave  example  and  wrap  them-

selves in the white bandages of unity so that we all truly look the same color.  Albinos, you’re 
halfway there. 

You see, White people are already wrapped in bandages: the skin God gave us 

to protect us from racism. People of all colors deserve no less. 

MY VISION OF A RACE-FREE FUTURE 

Burn victim or Black guy? 
(It shouldn’t matter!) 

REMEMBER: While skin and race are often synonymous, skin cleansing is 

good, race cleansing is bad.

We’re  all  the  same.  Unfortunately,  not  everyone  sees  that.  They  get  too 

hung up on little things like “appearance” and “history” and “cultural identity.” 

In fact… 

I prefer to 
divide people by 
brand-loyalty. 

Some  People  seem  to  think  racism  still  exists.  These  people  are  racists. 

What’s their angle? I say follow the money. They have something to gain from 

keeping the race game afloat. What is it? 

BLIGHTS! SCAM-ERA! AFFIRMATIVE ACTION! 

Affirmative action is a prime example of the Leftist campaign to make ideas 

Like “ living wage” 

seem less dangerous than they are, through the strategic use of positive words. 

Think about it. How can something be bad if it is “affirmative”? And how can 

we ignore it if it is “action”? 9 See, its name does nothing to describe what “affir-

mative action” actually is: a system that rewards Group A and punishes Group 

B just because long ago something bad happened to Group A that incidentally 

made Group B a whole lot of money. 

Short version: 
“Never feel guilty.” 

One  of  my  mottos  is,  “Never  make  a  decision  because  you  feel  guilty.”  The 

bleeding hearts that came up with affirmative action back in the anything-goes 

1960s could have used my advice. They felt bad about the racial injustices of 

the past, so they decided to make it a crazy law that gave minorities preferen-

tial treatment when it came to the choicest jobs, scholarships, and roster spots 

Stay strong, NHL! 

on NBA teams. 

Like friendship, 
discrimination is a 
two-way street. 

GUT  SPEAKING:  The  worst  thing  about  affirmative  action  is  that  it 

encourages  reverse  discrimination,  so-called  because  it  goes  in  the 

opposite way of how we naturally discriminate. 

Here’s a typical story: A well-qualified young White man doesn’t get into the 

College  of  His  Choice,  but  has  a  strong  suspicion  that  a  lot  of  Black  guys 

might have. It gets worse: A hard-working White employee is passed over for a 

promotion in favor of a coworker who seems like he could be gay. What’s next? 

Should there be affirmative action in my bedroom? Should Chinese guys get a 

shot at my wife just because the conditions on the Transcontinental Railroad 

weren’t ideal? 

174  9 Sign me up! Sarcastically.

But  the  worst  thing  about  affirmative  action  is  that  it’s  Big  Government 

intruding into the world of business. I don’t need some bureaucrat telling me 

to be an equal opportunity employer. When it comes to job applicants at the 

Report, race is irrelevant. All they have to do is answer a skill-testing ques-

tionnaire: 

Sample Question: 

Question 43: We·re shooting an episode of The Colbert Report at the beach. 
It·s a very sunny day. What number SPF sunblock do you use? Support your 
answer: 

When it comes to affirmative action, I quote myself: “Hogwash!” However, most 

people quote noted beagle-abuser President Lyndon Johnson, who summed up 

his stance on the issue with the following analogy: “Imagine a hundred yard 

dash in which one of the two runners had his legs shackled together. He has 

progressed ten yards, while the unshackled runner has gone fifty yards. How 

do they rectify the situ-

ation?  Do  they  merely 

remove 

the  shackles 

and  allow  the  race  to 

proceed?…Would it not 

be  the  better  part  of 

justice  to  allow  the 

previously 

shackled 

runner to make up the 

forty-yard  gap,  or  to 

start  the  race  all  over 

again?”10 

The press was a lot easier to entertain in 1964. 

10  He actually said this. 

175 

I   A M   A M E R I C A   ( A N D   S O   C A N   Y O U ! )  

Johnson was right on one point: Racial issues in this country deserve the same 

amount of attention we give track and field events. 

While Johnson’s idea was terrible for public policy, he stumbled upon what I 

think would be a great improvement for track and field: shackles! How exciting 

would it be to give each runner a unique, massive obstacle to overcome! 

Here’s how I see the 100 yard dash of tomorrow: 

LANE

Runner forced to wear a sandwich board 

Runner in ice skates 

Runner must run backward holding a hand mirror 

Runner’s pockets filled with sausages with a pack

Bare feet on a lane of wet bathroom tile—
 responsible for 80% of household fatalities! 

Runner given horrible news moments before start—

Shout it from the loftiest mountaintops and through the 

deepest valleys: Racism is no more! Bigotry, that grim hydra, 

which once reared its heads in every corner of our proud 

society, infecting all Americans with its venomous bite, has 

been vanquished. And I have done my part to slay it. 

I marched on Washington shoulder-to-shoulder with Dr. 

King. I labored alongside Reverend Jackson in Chicago. I 

was instrumental in bringing integration to the University of 

Rev. George A. Lewis, 
Ex-Civil Rights Leader 

Alabama, and thanks in part to my actions, racism gave way to 

equality, oppression to justice, and segregation to brotherhood. 

But as justice rose like a mighty tide from the Mississippi 

delta to the highest corridors of power, my own sense of purpose receded. What is a 

Civil Rights leader to do once Civil Rights have been permanently achieved? 

For a while, I returned to full-time Reverending. But being a preacher is hard work, 

and let’s face it, without racism to rail against, my sermons didn’t have the same zazz. 

So I left my church and sought new causes to champion. 

I tried marching alongside another oppressed group, the homosexuals. But then I 

found out what they did when they weren’t marching. 

Other protests proved no better fit. I couldn’t in good conscience join the No-Nukes 

movement, because I’m a firm believer in America’s nuclear first strike capabilities. 

And I’d rather not recount the lack of appetite for political change at the St. Patrick’s 

Day Parade. 

After that, I flailed around a bit. I remained committed to the principles of non-

violence, but I adapted it to the injustices I encountered in the new post-racist world. 

I organized a sit-in to protest the unfair practices of a local restaurant. ($13.00 for a 

spicy tuna roll? Come on!) But it failed to achieve change. 

I grew isolated and disconsolate. And as painful as it is to admit, in the depths of my 

despair I once tried to reintroduce racism, but those Korean grocers would not rise to 

my bait. 

As of this writing, I am unemployed, and let me tell you, the pension benefits 

177 

offered by the Civil Rights Movement are meager at best.  I am currently available to 

fight for the downtrodden, freelance mass-rallying, and light roof repair.

I’m free at last.” If only he had known the cost.

WE  ARE  BEING  COLONIZED  BY  AN 

INVADING  FORCE!  DID  YOU  KNOW 

THAT  THERE  ARE  MORE  ILLEGAL 

MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS IN AMERICA 

TODAY  THAN  THERE  WERE  AMERICAN  TROOPS  IN 

OCCUPIED GERMANY AFTER WORLD WAR II? UNLIKE MOST 

OF MY FACTS, I CAN BACK THAT ONE UP WITH REALITY. 

Experts say there are 12 to 14 million illegal immigrants in the United States. 

To put that into perspective, if you took all the foreigners who have no business 

living in America and put them into Dodge Caravans (remember, those seat 

six) and drove them out of the country taking up all three lanes of a highway, 

the line of minivans would stretch for I don’t care how long, because the more 

important question is: How can we get them into those vans? 

GOOD NEWS: You won’t need any documentation to get into my opinions 

on  immigration,  because  through  the  very  act  of  buying  this  book  your 

identity has been electronically entered into a secret government registry. 

DO WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ILLEGALS? 

I’ll say! 

We still need a urine

Carnegie was an immigrant!!!!!!!!” 

I   A M   A M E R I C A   ( A N D   S O   C A N   Y O U ! )  

Now a lot of people, including my spellcheck, have a problem with the term 

“illegals.” They say it’s not a word, and even if it were it would be insensitive to 

the feelings of the people who are breaking our nation’s laws. Fine. Let’s call 

them “immorals” because what could be more immoral than a Guatemalan 

crossing into this country to pick our American fruit just because her kids 

are poor? 

I  can  hear  the  cries  now:  “How  can  you  suggest  that  we  slam  the  door?! 

America  is  a  nation  of  immigrants!!  We  all  have  ancestors  who  left  their 

crowded,  impoverished  homelands  behind  for  America!!!!  Even  Andrew 

First of all, cool it with the exclamation marks.1 The cost of this ink comes 

out  of  my  advance.  Second,  it’s  interesting  you  should  bring  up  Andrew 

Carnegie—one  of  our  nation’s  most  esteemed  robber  barons.  Yes,  he  was 

born in Scotland. So what makes him different from the type of “immorals” 

we’re experiencing today? 

Uncover your ears and listen. 

Once upon a Time, there was the right kind of foreigner. 

Yes, Virginia, there is a right kind of foreigner. The kind who comes to America, 

loses his brogue and creates U.S. Steel. When he dies, he leaves the legacy 

of  breaking  the  Homestead  Strike  of  1892,  paving  the  road  for  non-union 

workers everywhere! If he admits to any foreign ties, it’s to having a hunting 

estate  at  Skilbo  Castle  in  Scotland.  And  that’s  it.  No  parades.  No  crazy  hat 

dances.  His  only  clubs  are  ones  like  “The  South  Fork  Fishing  and  Hunting 

Club” whose manmade, trout-stuffed lake burst through its dam leaving 2,200 

dead in one of the greatest floods in American history, the Johnstown Flood 

of 1889. Sad event, great social club. Over 60 millionaires, and that was back 

I wonder what they 
cost today. 

when trolley rides cost a penny. 

GUT SPEAKING: Of course, we can’t all be Andrew Carnegies, but we can 

honor the struggles and ambitions of our immigrant ancestors by doing as 

they did: leaving the past behind for the sake of a brighter future. 

182  1 And don’t you dare put any of them upside-down and in front of sentences. 

I M M I G R A N T S  

MY  STRUGGLE: I am a member of a mixed-race marriage. While I am the 

proud product of hardy Irish Catholic stock, my wife is Scots Presbyterian. In 

the Old Country, our love could never have been. In fact, a glance at my wife’s 

family records shows that her ancestors moved onto the very land my family 

was forced to abandon when that Roundhead son-of-a-bitch Oliver Cromwell 

More like Crom-bad 

forced the Irish west of the river Shannon to farm rocks. But when the Colbert 

clan  set  sail  for  America,  they  harbored  two  shining  hopes:  that  they  could 

survive a three-month steerage passage on coal-and-onion-peel soup; and that 

one  day  their  children  could  forget  the  enmity  of  the  past  and  live  a  life  of 

freedom.  I’ve  done  them  one  better.  Seven  generations  on,  I’ve  “planted  my 

Irish flag” on the very family that stole our land. 

See, the great thing about my marriage is that it symbolizes the hope America 

once  offered  its  immigrants.  Here,  immigrants  received  a  gift  never  given 

before  in  world  history:  They  could  leave  the  past  behind. (Another  less 

exciting gift was cholera.) How lucky they were to get to erase all remnants 

of their previous lives, languages and cultures and go about the business of 

becoming an American Christian. 

Arrivederci, 
“Arrivederci” 

So let’s take that beautiful idea to its logical conclusion and not only leave the 

past behind but deny the past ever happened.2 Like this: 

America is not a land of immigrants. 

There. Was that so hard to say? It makes sense if you think about it. It feels like 

we’ve been here forever, doesn’t it? Let’s just assume we have been. 

How does it taste to smash the shackles of our past? It tastes like freedom. 

And freedom doesn’t 
need chipotle sauce 

Now that we’ve liberated ourselves from the old factual myth of our immigrant 

history, we can focus on the future. And let me tell you, there are dark times 

ahead, because for the first time in our new history we are being swarmed by 

legions of immigrants.

Here are three things we can do to secure the borders today. 

The ponchos are 
coming! The ponchos 
are coming! 

1  Heavily arm our volunteer militias. The failure of leadership in 

Washington has given rise to a new border patrol of selfless patriots 

called the Minutemen. I have hung out with these guys. Let me 

assure you they take their duties deadly seriously. Let me also assure 

you that night-vision goggles are cool. Get a pair.3 

A lesson for us all 

2 

Take a lesson from the Chinese. We need to build a 2000-mile 

long wall along our southern border. This will have two benefits. 

First of all, when I’m worried I like to stay busy. Building a giant wall 

is a great way to keep the nation’s mind off how many immigrants 

enter the country through airports. Second, this wall might actually 

keep people out. If it’s built right, not like that picket fence the 

Russians threw up across Berlin. We don’t want these Mexican 

Jumping Beans hopping over whenever they feel like it. Make it tall. 

I mean tall enough that if you bake at the top of it, you’d need to use 

the high-altitude instructions.4 I’m talking about something that can

be seen from space, with double-wall construction, machine-gun 

nests and a flaming moat loaded with fireproof crocodiles. 

3  You want to end the swarm, take away the honey pot. 

Everybody says immigrants just do the jobs Americans don’t want 

to do, but let’s test that theory. They pick our fruits and vegetables. 

Who wouldn’t want to have a job that got them out in the fresh 

air more often? Hell, I pay twenty bucks a pop for the privilege of 

picking apples and pumpkins every October. And the hay ride is 

extra!

4  And you’d better be baking an apple pie. 

I M M I G R A N T S  

If  we  really  want  to  get  rid  of  these  occupational  interlopers,  I  say  we  give 

them the jobs nobody wants to do. Here are a few American jobs that will have 

them packing their piñatas in no time:

CANARY IN A COAL MINE 

You will never hear me criticize the Statue of Liberty. You can’t get more 

American than her—that’s why the French gave her up. 

I can, however, criticize poetry. Just look at this item I saw in the 

New York Sun. 

Misprint Is Spied In Lazarus Poem At Liberty Island
 BY GARY SHAPIRO— Staff Reporter of the Sun 

December 8, 2006 

There appears to be an error on the bronze plaque inside the pedestal 
of the Statue of Liberty, inscribed with the famous sonnet “The New 
Colossus” by Emma Lazarus. 
Lazarus’s poem contains the immortal lines: “ ‘Give me your tired, 
your  poor,  /  Your  huddled  masses  yearning  to  breathe  free,  /  The 
wretched refuse of your teeming shore.’” Just prior to these lines on 
the  plaque  are  inscribed  the  following  lines:  “ ‘Keep  ancient  lands, 
your  storied  pomp!’  cries  she  /  With  silent  lips.”  But  in  the  hand-
written manuscript for a collection of poems that Lazarus compiled 
in 1886, a year before her death, the phrase “ancient lands” is set off 
by commas: “ ‘Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!’ ” 

Whatever  happened  to  the  old  adage,  “Copy  edit  twice,  cast  in  bronze 

once”? Now we’ve spent 120 years thinking our “pomp” should be keeping 

“ancient  lands,”  instead  of  “ancient  lands”  keeping  our  “pomp”!  That 

changes everything. 

Up till now, this poem has always been interpreted to mean that we should 

throw our arms wide open to every Dutch Boy who wants to paddle his 

bong across the Atlantic. 

But with the discovery of this error, who knows what in the hell Lazarus 

meant to say?  Maybe there are other manuscripts of the poem out there 

with all different punctuation.  Different words, even. 

There’s no certainty 

186 

The Old Colossus 

anymore whether this statue was intended to be welcoming to immigrants at all.  Maybe 

that torch isn’t meant to be a beacon, but a searchlight to make it easier for the INS to 

spot people sneaking over the border. 

I say, let’s use this opportunity to replace the error-filled, unverifiable and troublesome 

Lazarus  poem  with  something  a  little  more  in  tune  with  the  times. 

Something  that’s 

impossible to punctuate incorrectly.

Those guys down on the field, they gotta go out and earn it every day. Your average

we let our average go down too low, I mean our average of real Americans, we’ll end

about foreigners. They’re bringin’ our stats down.

the way reality works. They look at the world and ask questions about it. Only

Kill two birds: add

You see, like a load of dirty laundry spontaneously generates rats, questions 

spontaneously  generate  data  and  facts.  And  trust  me:  I  wouldn’t  italicize 

these things if I didn’t believe they were dangerous. It’s not like I’m looking 

for extra work. 

Just take a look at history. Over the centuries, scientific evidence has viciously 

attacked the status quo. There’s a reason we have a status quo: It ensures that 

the status of our lives is consistent so we can meet our quotas. When 18th-

century scientist Edward Jenner discovered that parents could protect their 

children from smallpox with a vaccine, it may have saved a few thousand lives, 

but it also destroyed the magic amulet industry. 

Science attacks our most cherished opinions. Opinions which come straight 

from  our  collective  gut.  Oh,  wait,  according  to  gastroenterologists,  the  only 

thing that comes from the gut is waste left from the digestion of food. That’s 

right, “waste.” I guess that means that scientists literally think our opinions 

should be flushed down the toilet! 

Well, I’m not flushing and neither should you! In the last few centuries science 

has made some giant strides in our understanding of the world, but it’s time to 

turn back the clock. Speaking of clocks, how about we stop letting the earth’s 

rotation dictate what time it is? I say it’s Morning in America!2

pot of coffee. This might take a while. 

Step 1: Observation: “Mankind has a pretty nice relationship with God.” 

Step 2: Hypothesis: “I bet people would start to doubt the existence of God 

if I claimed that the Earth revolves around the Sun, 

instead of the other way around like the Bible says.”

It’s natural to be curious about our world, but the scientific method is just one 

theory about how to best understand it. We live in a democracy, which means 

Just don’t be curious 
about your body. 

that we should treat every theory equally. 

So here’s an alternative two-step method for understanding the universe: 

Step 1: Remember: Six thousand years ago, God created the  

Heavens and the Earth. 

Step 2: Repeat as necessary. 

Step 3? Repent as 
necessary. 

Isn’t  that  a  whole  lot  easier  than  analyzing  electromagnetic  background  for 

evidence of some “Big Bang” fourteen billion years ago? Fourteen billion is a 

pretty big number, and God didn’t create us so we could waste time trying to 

picture fourteen billion cupcakes. (DON’T TRY THIS!) 

One… two… aaargh! 

MOVING  ON:  That  about  covers  science,  but  what  about  the  folks  who 

practice this crackpot doctrine? I spend a lot of time with scientists (about 6 

minutes with each one that comes on my show), and I can honestly say that 

despite appearances, most of them are decent, well-intentioned people. They’re 

just  dangerously  deluded.  It’s  easy  to  see  how  they  get  sucked  in.  They’re

physically awkward and lonely, so they spent their adolescence down by the 

creek studying the creatures that live there. “I may be ridiculed at school,” they 

think, “but a crayfish would never judge me.”5 

So  my  heart  goes  out  to  them.  Figuratively.  I  would  never  actually  entrust 

my heart to scientists—they’d probably implant it in a baboon. And a baboon 

with my heart would be practically unstoppable. Baboon strength and agility 

combined with my determination and media savvy? It would be a threat to all 

of humanity.6 

But a baboon with

ELITE E-LERT: Scientists claim that the earth is four billion years old. Yet 

they still can’t explain many of the enduring mysteries of the universe. Hey, 

scientists, if you’re so smart, why do you need more than four billion years 

to figure stuff out? 

NO  HEROES  ALLOWED: I’ve said it before (see above), science is elitist. 

Making rules, setting boundaries, constantly telling us what is and isn’t flam-

mable7—all without input from the very people who are expected to abide by 

those laws. I know I never consented to Gravity Without Representation. 

So who gave some lab-coated pipette wielder permission to act like he knows 

more  than  I  do  about  mitochondria,  just  because  he  spent  twenty  years  of 

his life studying them in a laboratory? PhDs and 300-page dissertations don’t 

make his opinion any more valid. I happen to have some mitochondria myself, 

Furthermore,  why  should  I  care  that  four  out  of  five  dentists  recommend 

Crest? What qualifies some fluoride-pusher to call the shots when it comes to 

my oral hygiene? A diploma from Dental Camp? 

The point is, no one is more qualified to tell me what the world means to me, 

than me. And don’t think you’re any different: No one is more qualified to tell 

you what the world means to you than me. 

So  I’ve  prepared  an  itemized  and  exhaustive  list  of  my  thoughts  on  various 

scientific disciplines. You won’t find these opinions in any textbook, unless it 

happens to be one I’ve defaced. 

Mytochondria!

Evolution 

I’m thinking about it 
right now. 

To put it simply, evolution is an affront to God. Anyone who believes in it will 

burn in eternal hellfire, probably while being prodded by flaming chimpan-

zees with razor-sharp bananas. 

Evolutionists’ main claim is that one day we decided to stop being 

monkeys and turned ourselves into humans. Well, if that’s true, why aren’t 

more monkeys escaping from zoos? Think about it. They could turn into 

humans, then disguise themselves as janitors and walk out of their cages. But 

I guess evolution doesn’t have an answer for that one. 

The main perpetrator of this monkey lie is Charles Darwin. He wrote all 

about it in his 1859 book The Origin of Species. He claims to have developed 

this “theory” after studying “finches” on the Galapagos “Islands,” but I can 

guess why he really came up with it. He was on the Galapagos Islands for 

Spring Break, got smashed, woke up in bed next to a monkey, and then had to 

come up with a theory that made it all okay. 

I used to be pro-Fahrenheit—after all, it’s the American way of measuring heat. 

That is, until I learned it was named after some Dutch guy. Sorry, but I don’t

Hey, Kids! Now you can disprove evolution

in your own backyard! 

Here’s what you’ll need: 

One (1) 
fishbowl 

One (1) 
pitcher of water 

One (1) 
hamster, alive 

One (1) 
hardbound copy, 
Charles Darwin’s 
Origin of Species 

…and now here’s the experiment! 

DISCLAIMER: The following demonstration is for educational purposes 

only, in the sense that you will “only” become “educated” by doing it.  

In other 

words: Don’t try this at home. (Try it at a PETA rally.)  

Step 1:  Fill your fishbowl with the water. 

I don’t want to give anything away, 

but soon it’s going to be a bowl for another kind of animal. 

Step 2:  Drop the hamster (you can call it “Skip”) into the fishbowl. 

Step 3:  Cover the fishbowl with 

Charles Darwin’s 

Origin of Species. 

Step 4:  Seems like a pretty desperate situation Skip has gotten himself into. 

This would be an ideal time for evolution to kick in! 

Step 5:  Follow the Scientific Method—observe! Is the hamster “evolving” 

gills? Has he “evolved” a jackhammer to drill through the fishbowl, or 

“adapted to his environment” with a tiny hamster flamethrower to burn 

through Origin of Species

? Didn’t think so. 

Step 6: Let the hamster go. Just because Darwin was a sick twist with a God 

Complex doesn’t mean we have to buy into his power trip. 

(You could also call the hamster “Teddy.”)

INSTRUCTIONS ON DEFROSTING MY HEAD 

Defrosting isn’t as easy as you’d think. 

The best way to defrost my head is simply to move it from the cryogenic freezer 

to a refrigerator. Make sure you place my head in a pan at least two inches 

deep; you’re going to want to catch all my juices. 

If you want my head up and shouting sooner, then place my head in a big pot 

full of cold water. Allow a half an hour of soaking time per pound of head until 

thawing  is  complete.  Replace  the  water  every  half  hour  and  make  sure  my 

head is in a leak-proof package because brain tissue can absorb moisture and 

become mushy. 

It’s also possible to defrost my head in the microwave. Set the power to low-

medium for six minutes per pound, rotating my head occasionally. 

DO  NOT  thaw  my  head  by  leaving  it  out  overnight  in  a  room-temperature 

environment  (like  a  picnic  cooler).  I  will  become  susceptible  to  contamina-

tion by bacteria like salmonella or something. Do not let me be contaminated 

with salmonella or something, because when you reattach me to that prisoner’s 

body, I will be angry!

DON’T MAKE THIS ABOUT ME. YOU ALWAYS DO THAT. IT’S 

ABOUT YOU AND WHAT YOU’VE LEARNED FROM  ME. 

But make no mistake—my book isn’t a monologue; it’s a dialogue—a dialogue 

between me and my opinions, and you’ve been welcomed to eavesdrop on us. 

Just a glance back at the Table of Contents should give you a pretty good idea 

of those things about which you didn’t know my opinions before you read the 

book, which you know now. 

You’ve learned about the forces aligned to destroy America—whether they be 

terrorists, environmentalists, or Kashi brand breakfast cereals. You’ve learned 

how  to  detect  left-wing  media  bias  by  looking  at  the  media  and  saying  “It’s 

biased.”  You’ve  learned  that  my  dog’s  name  is  Gipper.  What’s  more,  you’ve 

learned many things that will anger you when they are left out or altered in the 

eventual movie adaptation of this book.

And  there’s  so  much  more.  In  fact,  however  carefully  you’ve  just  read  this 

book, there are sure to be lessons within it that you’ve yet to fully compre-

hend. That’s why you should buy a fresh copy and read it again. The smell and 

feel of a new book is part of the lesson. 

And remember, just because you bought this book, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t 

buy the audio book. There are some things that simply cannot be conveyed in 

print. Inflection, for instance. 

Plus, I’m working on a quote-a-day calendar (as well as an audio quote-a-day 

calendar). There’s a lot of repurposing of content yet to be done, believe me! 

I’m  certain  that  each  of  these  products  will  become  a  valuable  tool  in  your 

social  justice  toolbox,  and  each  will  probably  feature  a  small  amount  of 

original bonus material. 

FROM HERE, TO WHERE NOW, DO WE GO? 

This  is  where  you  come  in.  You  need  to  take  the  lessons  of  this  book  and 

apply them in your community—at the ballot box, at your local School Board 

meeting,  when  you’re  crossing  a  picket  line,  when  you’re  volunteering  your 

time  and  firearms  at  a  Texas  border  fence.  Heck,  there’s  no  reason  not  to 

try cold-calling random people out of the phone book and telling them what 

you’ve learned. (If they’re not home, leave a long message—maybe the chapter 

on The Media?) 

Once you’re armed with my knowledge, you should never again be afraid to 

speak up. For the more you speak up, the louder you become. And the more 

you speak up in my voice, the louder I become. If someone has a problem with 

it, just say, “Well, it’s not just my opinion, it’s Stephen Colbert’s opinion, and I 

happen to agree.” Then it’s two against one, and we win. 

I promise to hold up my end of the bargain. I will continue to bring you the best 

my gut has to offer via my hit television broadcast, The Colbert Report. I will 

continue to make a wide variety of products available at my website that will

Well,  you’ve  reached  the  end  of  this  book.  If  you  read  it  hard  enough,  you 

should now be hearing my voice in your head. Put down the book for a second. 

Can you still hear me? Don’t be afraid to answer out loud. I can hear you, too. 

Good. 

You should also be seeing my thoughts in the margins of other books. I know in 

the introduction I said not to make a habit out of reading, but just like the main 

character in any truly great novel/autobiography, at the end, I’ve found myself 

a changed man. I’ve come to realize that my biggest problem with other books 

was simply that I didn’t write them. 

Stay  strong.  Be  brave.  Share  (newly  bought  copies  of)  this  book  with  your 

friends  and  family.  You’ll  be  glad  you  did.  And  more  importantly,  so  will  I. 

Because after all: 

I Am America (And So Can You!) 

And you can take that to the bank. I know I will. 

Amen.

Fold the upper half of the cover, Section A, lengthwise over the field of text,

Gently bring Section A to rest upon Section B and Section C being careful to 
support book from underside, or back cover, Section E. If executed correctly,

AP PEND IX 

THE W HITE HO US E 
CORRESPONDENTS ’ DINNE R 

Wherever I go, from P. Diddy’s annual White Party to 
Hollywood  premieres  to  the  men’s  room  at  Sharper 
Image, I meet Heroes.1 And they all want to know the 
same  thing:  “What  was  it  like  to  be  you,  Stephen  T. 
Colbert,  at  the  2006  White  House  Correspondents’ 
Dinner?” This is for them. 

It  was  an  average  Thursday  afternoon  at  The  Report.  I  was  making  minor 

repairs to my power massage recliner when the phone rang. 

“Colbert. Go.”  

“Go on, Mr. Smith.” 

“Mr.  Colbert,  it’s  Mark  Smith,  President  of  the  White  House  Press  Corps   
Association.” 

I was suspicious. Mark Smith? It sounded like a made up name. 

“Well, every year the Association holds a charity dinner and we would like you  
to be our after-dinner speaker. The President will be there.” 

The President will be there. His words rang in my ear. I was interested, but 

first I had question: How much does it pay? I don’t care what the event is or 

who is going to be there. No. Free. Rides.

After my price was met, I threw myself into the preparations. Every night after 

the show, I would eat heavy banquet food and then stand behind a podium and 

try to talk. It was grueling work and there were some nights that I thought I 

couldn’t make it. But by the day before the event, I could talk for 30 minutes on 

a stomachful of Chicken Kiev and cheesecake. Nothing could stop me now. All 

that was left was to write the speech. 

Now the Heroes know how fast I can write when I don’t edit myself. Caring 

about whether something “makes sense” or “promotes violence” only leads to 

writer’s block and ultimately suicide. I don’t play that game. My plan was to 

write the speech on the car ride over to the dinner. Unfortunately, the dinner 

turned out to be at the Washington Hilton—the same hotel where I was staying. 

That meant whatever remarks I was going to prepare would have to be written 

in the elevator ride from my suite to the banquet room. I’d have to wing every-

thing else straight from my gut. So be it. I love a challenge, plus elevators have 

emergency stop buttons. 

Finally, the night came. April 29, 2006. Was I nervous? Sure. But I put on my 

game  face.  I  also  put  on  my  game  clothes.  The  Tuxedo.  I  was  born  to  wear 

a tux. In fact, as a child my parents used to rent me out as a ring bearer for 

shotgun weddings. 

Barry Manilow. 

NEWS FLASH: I wore my White House Correspondents’ Dinner tuxedo to 

the 2006 Emmy Awards. After I lost, I had it cremated and scattered over 

First stop was a private VIP cocktail party with the President. How exclusive 

was it? Two words: Open Bar. Not even drink tickets. Karl Rove just stamped 

the back of your hand when you came in. 

I was mixing with the crème de la crème of Republican celebrities. Names like 

Tommy Lasorda and the wife from Everybody Loves Raymond. 

Then, George W. Bush arrived. He made a beeline for me, in that, like a bee, he 

went all around the room and then came up to me last. 

“Pleased to meet you, ColberT.” 

219 

I   A M   A M E R I C A   ( A N D   S O   C A N   Y O U ! )  

Then he extended the hand that signed off on “Shock and Awe.” It was as soft 

as a mitten made from angel food cake. His eyes were steely, and he had the 

faraway look of a man who was replaying a video game in his mind. 

With the President by my side, I was now ready to give the Washington Press 

Corps a pranging they would not soon forget. I was inspired, I was focused, and 

I had to pee like a racehorse at an iced tea convention. I approached a Secret 

Service agent and asked where the Little Pundits’ room was. He led me down 

a hallway to a door emblazoned with the Great Seal and the words “POTUS 

Only.” I was going to use the bathroom reserved for our Commander in Chief. 

My  heart  swelled  with  pride  as  I  lifted  the  seat  and  imagined  Eisenhower, 

Nixon, and Reagan doing the same—really made it hard to get a flow started. 

But I’m proud to say I left my mark in that true Hall of Presidents. My only 

regret was that I had a light lunch. 

Sitting on the dais overlooking Washington’s elite, I felt like the Best Man at 

a wedding between the Statue of Liberty and Mount Rushmore. Everywhere I 

looked there were members of Congress, Justices of the Supreme Court, and 

Distinguished Black Actors. My months of training came in handy when the 

meal turned out to be both surf and turf. I entered what climbers call the Death 

Zone.  With  a  bellyful  of  protein,  I  watched  President  Bush’s  presentation, 

which co-starred a President Bush impersonator. By this point, I was so high 

on endorphins that I had double vision, so to me, there were four President 

Bushes up there. Ecstasy! 

hot and hard: 

Then it was my turn. My heart raced as I strode to the podium and brought it

14  black  bulletproof  SUVs  out  front, 

could you please move them? They are

SUVs and they need to get out. 

Wow. Wow, what an honor. The White House Correspondents’ Dinner. To actu-

ally sit here, at the same table with my hero, George W. Bush, to be this close 

to  the  man.  I  feel  like  I’m  dreaming.  Somebody  pinch  me.  You  know  what?

helped. 

By the way, before I get started, if anybody needs anything else at their tables, 

just  speak  slowly  and  clearly  into  your  table  numbers.  Somebody  from  the 

NSA will be right over with a cocktail. Mark Smith, ladies and gentlemen of the 

press corps, Madame First Lady, Mr. President, my name is Stephen Colbert 

and tonight it’s my privilege to celebrate this President. We’re not so different, 

he and I. We get it. We’re not brainiacs on the nerd patrol. We’re not members 

of the Factinista. We go straight from the gut, right sir? That’s where the truth 

lies, right down here in the gut. Do you know you have more nerve endings 

in your gut than you have in your head? You can look it up. I know some of 

you are going to say “I did look it up, and that’s not true.” That’s because you 

looked it up in a book.

Next time, look it up in your gut. I did. 

My gut tells me that’s how our nervous 

system works. Every night on my show, 

The  Colbert  Report,  I  speak  straight 

from  the  gut,  OK?  I  give  people  the

51, if you count both 
Dakotas. 

I’m a simple man with a simple mind. I hold a simple set of beliefs that I live 

by. Number one, I believe in America. I believe it exists. My gut tells me I live 

there.  I  feel  that  it  extends  from  the  Atlantic  to  the  Pacific,  and  I  strongly 

believe  it  has  50  states.  And  I  cannot  wait  to  see  how  the  Washington  Post 

spins that one tomorrow. I believe in democracy. I believe democracy is our 

greatest export. At least until China figures out a way to stamp it out of plastic 

for three cents a unit. 

In fact, Ambassador Zhou Wenzhong, welcome. Your great country makes our 

Happy Meals possible. I said it’s a celebration. I believe the government that 

governs best is the government that governs least. And by these standards, we 

have set up a fabulous government in Iraq. 

I also saw an 
after-hours show 
in Vegas called 
The Trickle-Down. 
Truly uplifting. 

I believe in pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps. I believe it is possible— 

I  saw  this  guy  do  it  once  in  Cirque  du  Soleil.  It  was  magical.  And  though  I 

am a committed Christian, I believe that everyone has the right to their own 

religion, be you Hindu, Jewish or Muslim. I believe there are infinite paths to 

accepting Jesus Christ as your personal savior. 

Ladies and gentlemen, I believe it’s yogurt. But I refuse to believe it’s not butter. 

Most of all, I believe in this President. 

Now I know there are some polls out there saying this man has a 32% approval 

rating.  But  guys  like  us,  we  don’t  pay  attention  to  the  polls.3 We  know  that 

polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in 

“reality.” And reality has a well-known liberal bias. 

So,  Mr.  President,  please,  pay  no  attention  to  the  people  who  say  the  glass

important  to  set  up  your  jokes  prop-

erly,  sir.  Sir,  pay  no  attention  to  the 

people who say the glass is half empty, 

because  32%  means  it’s  2/3  empty. 

There’s still some liquid in that glass is 

my  point,  but  I  wouldn’t  drink  it.  The 

last third is usually backwash.

T H E   W H I T E   H O U S E   C O R R E S P O N D E N T S ’   D I N N E R  

Okay,  look,  folks,  my  point  is  that  I  don’t  believe  this  is  a  low  point  in  this 

presidency. I believe it is just a lull before a comeback. I mean, it’s like the 

movie Rocky. All right. The President in this case is Rocky Balboa and Apollo 

Creed is—everything else in the world. It’s the tenth round. He’s bloodied. His 

corner man is Mick, who in this case I guess would be the Vice President, and 

Maybe he’s more like 
Stallone’s Demolition 
Man—someone from 
the past who blows 
things up.

Bush is yelling, “Cut me, Dick, cut me!,” and every time he falls everyone says, 

“Stay down! Stay down!” Does he stay down? No. Like Rocky, he gets back up, 

and in the end he—actually, he loses in the first movie. 

 Spoiler alert! 

OK. Doesn’t matter. The point is it is the heartwarming story of a man who was 

repeatedly punched in the face. So don’t pay attention to the approval ratings 

that say 68% of Americans disapprove of the job this man is doing. I ask you 

this,  does  that  not  also  logically  mean  that  68%  approve  of  the  job  he’s  not 

doing? Think about it. I haven’t. 

I stand by this man. I stand by this man because he stands for things. Not only 

for  things,  he  stands  on  things.  Things  like  aircraft  carriers  and  rubble  and 

recently flooded city squares. And that sends a strong message: that no matter 

what happens to America, she will always rebound—with the most powerfully 

staged photo ops in the world. 

Now there may be an energy crisis. This President has a very forward-thinking 

energy policy. Why do you think he’s down on the ranch cutting that brush all 

the time? He’s trying to create an alternative energy source. By 2008 we will 

have a mesquite-powered car! 

And I just like the guy. He’s a good Joe. Obviously loves his wife, calls her his 

better half. And polls show America agrees. She’s a true lady and a wonderful 

woman. But I just have one beef, ma’am. I’m sorry, but this reading initiative. 

I’m sorry—I’ve never been a fan of books. I don’t trust them. They’re all fact, 

no heart. I mean, they’re elitist, telling us what is or isn’t true, or what did or 

didn’t happen. Who’s Britannica to tell me the Panama Canal was built in 1914? 

If I want to say it was built in 1941, that’s my right as an American!4 I’m with the 

President—let history decide what did or did not happen. 

4 “The Panama Canal was built in 1941.” Now it’s in a book, so it must be a fact. Eat it, Britannica! 

223 

The snapshots heard 
’round the world. 

I   A M   A M E R I C A   ( A N D   S O   C A N   Y O U ! )  

The greatest thing about this man is he’s steady. You know where he stands. 

He believes the same thing Wednesday that he believed on Monday, no matter 

what happened Tuesday. Events can change; this man’s beliefs never will. 

Never switch belief-
horses midstream-of-
consciousness. 

As  excited  as  I  am  to  be  here  with 

the  President,  I  am  appalled  to  be 

surrounded by the liberal media that is 

destroying America, with the exception 

of Fox News. Fox News gives you both 

sides of every story: the President’s side 

Geraldo also gives his 
mustache’s side. 

and the Vice President’s side.5 

But the rest of you, what are you thinking, reporting on NSA wiretapping or 

secret prisons in Eastern Europe?6 Those things are secret for a very impor-

tant  reason:  they’re  super-depressing.  And  if  that’s  your  goal,  well,  misery 

accomplished. 

Over the last five years you people were so good—over tax cuts, WMD intel-

ligence, the effect of global warming. We Americans didn’t want to know, and 

you had the courtesy not to try to find out. Those were good times, as far as

we knew. 

But,  listen,  let’s  review  the  rules.  Here’s  how  it  works:  the  President  makes 

decisions. He’s the Decider. The press secretary announces those decisions, 

and you people of the press type those decisions down. Make, announce, type. 

Just put ’em through a spellcheck and go home. Get to know your family again. 

Make love to your wife. Write that novel you got kicking around in your head. 

You know—the one about the intrepid Washington reporter with the courage

Or Fantasy. 

to stand up to the administration. You know—fiction! 

Because really, what incentive do these people have to answer your questions, 

after all? I mean, nothing satisfies you. Everybody asks for personnel changes. 

So  the  White  House  has  personnel  changes.  Then  you  write,  “Oh,  they’re 

just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.” First of all, that is a terrible 

metaphor. This administration is not sinking. This administration is soaring. If 

anything, they are rearranging the deck chairs on the Hindenburg! 

And we’ve got a 
window seat!

General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They still support

Rumsfeld. 

Now Rumsfeld can

causing all this trouble: don’t let them retire! Come on, we’ve got a stop-loss 

program;  let’s  use  it  on  these  guys.  I’ve  seen  Zinni  and  that  crowd  on  Wolf

Jesse  Jackson  is  here,  the  Reverend.  Haven’t  heard  from  the  Reverend  in  a 

little while. I had him on the show. Very interesting and challenging interview. 

You can ask him anything, but he’s going to say what he wants, at the pace that 

he wants. It’s like boxing a glacier. Enjoy that metaphor, by the way, because 

your grandchildren will have no idea what a glacier is.

I  meant  to  say  he  brought  along  his  lovely  wife,  Joe  Wilson’s  wife.  Patrick

And, of course, we can’t forget the man of the hour, new press secretary, Tony

nothing like nobody else. McClellan, of course, eager to retire. Really felt like 

he needed to spend more time with Andrew Card’s children. Mr. President, I 

wish you hadn’t made the decision so quickly, sir. 

I  was  vying  for  the  job  myself.  I  think  I  would  have  made  a  fabulous  press 

secretary. I have nothing but contempt for these people. I know how to handle 

these clowns. 

In fact, sir, I brought along an audition tape, and with your indulgence, I’d like 

to at least give it a shot. So, ladies and gentlemen, my press conference.

INTRODUCTION: EXPOSITION OF THE QUESTION OF THE

MEANING OF BEING

 

I: THE NECESSITY, STRUCTURE, AND PRIORITY OF THE

QUESTION OF BEING

1. The Necessity for Explicitly Restating the Question of Being

 

 

 

H. 2

the  utmost 

intellectual  effort  from 

THIS  question  has  today  been  forgotten.  Even  though  in  our  time  we
deem it progressive to give our approval to ‘metaphysics’ again, it is held
that  we  have  been  exempted  from  the  exertions  of  a  newly  rekindled
γιγαντομαχία περὶ τῆς οὐσίας. Yet the question we are touching upon is not
just  a n y question. It is one which provided a stimulus for the researches of
Plato  and  Aristotle,  only  to  subside  from  then  on  as  a  theme  for  actual
investigation.(1) What these two men achieved was to persist through many
alterations and ‘retouchings’ down to the ‘logic’ of Hegel. And what they
the  phenomena,
wrested  with 
fragmentary and incipient though it was, has long since become trivialized.
Not only  that. On the  basis of the  Greeks’ initial contributions  towards
an  Interpretation  of  Being,  a  dogma  has  been  developed  which  not  only
declares  the  question  about  the  meaning  of  Being  to  be  superfluous,  but
sanctions its complete neglect. It is said that ‘Being’ is the most universal
and the emptiest of concepts. As such it resists every attempt at definition.
Nor  does  this  most  universal  and  hence  indefinable  concept  require  any
definition, for everyone uses it constantly and already understands what he
means  by  it.  In  this  way,  that  which  the  ancient  philosophers  found
continually  disturbing  as  something  obscure  and  hidden  has  taken  on  a
clarity and self-evidence such that if anyone continues to ask about it he is
charged with an error of method.
 

1. ‘…als thematische Frage wirklicher Untersuchung’. When Heidegger speaks of a question as
‘thematisch’,  he  thinks  of  it  as  one  which  is  taken  seriously  and  studied  in  a  systematic  manner.
While  we  shall  often  translate  this  adjective  by  its  cognate,  ‘thematic’,  we  may  sometimes  find  it

convenient to choose more flexible expressions involving the word ‘theme’. (Heidegger gives a fuller
discussion on H. 363.)

H. 3

 

At the beginning of our investigation it is not possible to give a detailed
account  of  the  presuppositions  and  prejudices  which  are  constantly
reimplanting  and  fostering  the  belief  that  an  inquiry  into  Being  is
unnecessary.  They  are  rooted  in  ancient  ontology  itself;  and  it  will  not  be
possible  to  interpret  that  ontology  adequately  until  the  question  of  Being
has been clarified and answered and taken as a clue—at least, if we are to
have  regard  for  the  soil  from  which  the  basic  ontological  concepts
developed,  and  if  we  are  to  see  whether  the  categories  have  been
demonstrated in a way that is appropriate and complete. We shall therefore
carry the discussion of these presuppositions only to the point at which the
necessity  for  restating  the  question  about  the  meaning  of  Being  becomes
plain. There are three such presuppositions.

1.  First,  it  has  been  maintained  that  ‘Being’  is  the  ‘most  universal’
concept: τὸ ὂν έστι καθόλου μάλιστα πάντων.(i) Illud quod primo cadit sub
apprehensione est ens, cuius intellectus includitur in omnibus, quaecumque
quis  apprehendit.  ‘An  understanding  of  Being  is  already  included  in
conceiving  anything  which  one  apprehends  in  entities.’(1)(ii)  But  the
‘universality’  of  ‘Being’  is  not  that  of  a  class  or genus.  The  term  ‘Being’
does  not  define  that  realm  of  entities  which  is  uppermost  when  these  are
Articulated conceptually according to genus and species: οὔτε τὸ ὂν γένος.
(iii) The ‘universality’ of Being ‘transcends’  any universality of genus. In
medieval  ontology  ‘Being’  is  designated  as  a  ‘transcendens’.  Aristotle
himself  knew  the  unity  of  this  transcendental  ‘universal’  as  a  unity  of
analogy  in  contrast  to  the  multiplicity  of  the  highest  generic  concepts
applicable to things. With this discovery, in spite of his dependence on the
way in which the ontological question had been formulated by Plato, he put
the  problem  of  Being  on  what  was,  in  principle,  a  new  basis.  To  be  sure,
even  Aristotle  failed  to  clear  away  the  darkness  of  these  categorial
interconnections. In medieval ontology this problem was widely discussed,
especially in the Thomist and Scotist schools, without reaching clarity as to
principles.  And  when  Hegel  at  last  defines  ‘Being’  as  the  ‘indeterminate
immediate’  and  makes  this  definition  basic  for  all  the  further  categorial
explications of his ‘logic’, he keeps looking in the same direction as ancient

ontology, except that he no longer pays heed to Aristotle’s problem of the
unity of Being as over against the multiplicity of ‘categories’ applicable to
things. So if it is said that ‘Being’ is the most universal concept, this cannot
mean  that  it  is  the  one  which  is  clearest  or  that  it  needs  no  further
discussion. It is rather the darkest of all.

1.  ‘  “…was  einer  am  Seienden  erfasst”  ’.  The  word  ‘Seiendes’,  which  Heidegger  uses  in  his
paraphrase, is one of the most important words in the book. The substantive ‘das Seiende’ is derived
from  the  participle  ‘seiend’  (see  note  1,  H.  1),  and  means  literally  ‘that  which  is’;  ‘ein  Seiendes’
means ‘something which is’. There is much to be said for translating ‘Seiendes’ by the noun ‘being’
or ‘beings’ (for it is often used in a collective sense). We feel, however, that it is smoother and less
confusing  to  write  ‘entity’  or  ‘entities’.  We  are  well  aware  that  in  recent  British  and  American
philosophy the term ‘entity’ has been used more generally to apply to almost anything whatsoever,
no  matter  what  its  ontological  status.  In  this  translation,  however,  it  will  mean  simply  ‘something
which  is’.  An  alternative  translation  of  the  Latin  quotation  is  given  by  the  English  Dominican
Fathers, Summa Theologica, Thomas Baker, London, I 915: ‘For that which, before aught else, falls
under  apprehension,  is  being,  the  notion  of  which  is  included  in  all  things  whatsoever  a  man
apprehends.’

2.  It  has  been  maintained  secondly  that  the  concept  of  ‘Being’  is
indefinable.  This  is  deduced  from  its  supreme  universality,(iv)  and  rightly
so,  if  definitio  fit  per  genus  proximum  et  differentiam  specificam.  ‘Being’
cannot indeed be conceived as an entity; enti non additur aliqua natura: nor
can  it  acquire  such  a  character  as  to  have  the  term  “entity”  applied  to  it.
“Being” cannot be derived from higher concepts by definition, nor can it be
presented  through  lower  ones.  But  does  this  imply  that  ‘Being’  no  longer
offers a problem? Not at all. We can infer only that ‘Being’ cannot have the
character  of  an  entity.  Thus  we  cannot  apply  to  Being  the  concept  of
‘definition’ as presented in traditional logic, which itself has its foundations
in ancient ontology and which, within certain limits, provides a justifiable
way  of  characterizing  “entities”.  The  indefinability  of  Being  does  not
eliminate the question of its meaning; it demands that we look that question
in the face.

3. Thirdly, it is  held  that ‘Being’  is  of all concepts the  one that is  self-
evident. Whenever one cognizes anything or makes an assertion, whenever

one comports oneself towards entities, even towards oneself,(1) some use is
made  of  ‘Being’;  and  this  expression  is  held  to  be  intelligible  ‘without
further ado’, just as everyone understands ‘The sky is blue’,  ‘I am  merry’,
and  the  like.  But  here  we  have  an  average  kind  of  intelligibility,  which
merely demonstrates that this is unintelligible. It makes manifest that in any
way of comporting oneself towards entities as entities—even in any Being
towards entities as entities—there lies a priori an enigma.(2) The very fact
that we already live in an understanding of Being and that the meaning of
Being  is  still  veiled  in  darkness  proves  that  it  is  necessary  in  principle  to
raise this question again.

Within  the  range  of  basic  philosophical  concepts—especially  when  we
come  to  the  concept  of  ‘Being’—it  is  a  dubious  procedure  to  invoke  self-
evidence,  if  indeed  the  ‘self-evident’  (Kant’s  ‘covert  judgments  of  the
common  reason’)(3)  is  to  become  the  sole  explicit  and  abiding  theme  for
one’s analytic—‘the business of philosophers’.

By considering these prejudices, however, we have made plain not only
that  the  question  of  Being  lacks  an  answer,  but  that  the  question  itself  is
obscure and without direction. So if it is to be revived, this means that we
must first work out an adequate way of formulating it.
 

iv.  Cf.  Pascal,  Pensées  et  Opuscules  (ed.  Brunschvicg),  Paris,  1912,  p.  169;  ‘On  ne  peut
entreprendre  de  définir  l’être  sans  tomber  dans  cette  absurdité:  car  on  ne  peut  définir  un  mot  sans
commencer  par  celui-ci,  c’est,  soit  qu’on  l’exprime  ou  qu’on  le  sous-entende.  Donc  pour  définir
l’être, il faudrait dire c’est, et ainsi employer le mot défini dans sa définition.’
 

1.  ‘..in  jedem  Verhalten  zu  Seiendem,  in  jedem  Sich-zu-sich-selbst-verhalten…’  The  verb
‘verhalten’ can refer to any kind of behaviour or way of conducting oneself, even to the way in which
one  relates  oneself  to  something  else,  or  to  the  way  one  refrains  or  holds  oneself  back.  We  shall
translate it in various ways.

2. ‘Sie macht offenbar, dass in jedem Verhalten und Sein zu Seiendem als Seiendem a priori ein
Rätsel  liegt.’  The  phrase  ‘Sein  zu  Seiendem’  is  typical  of  many  similar  expressions  an  which  the
substantive ‘Sein’ is followed by the preposition ‘zu’. In such expressions we shall usually translate
‘zu’  as  ‘towards’:  for  example,  ‘Being-towards-death’,  ‘Being  towards  Others’,  ‘Being  towards
entities within-the-world’.

2. The Formal Structure of the Question of Being

 

 

H. 5

The  question  of  the  meaning  of  Being  must  be  formulated.  If  it  is  a
fundamental question, or indeed the fundamental question, it must be made
transparent, and in an appropriate way.(1) We must therefore explain briefly
what  belongs  to  any  question  whatsoever,  so  that  from  this  standpoint  the
question  of  Being  can  be  made  visible  as  a  very  special  one  with  its  own
distinctive character.

Every  inquiry  is  a  seeking  [Suchen].  Every  seeking  gets  guided
beforehand by what is sought. Inquiry is a cognizant seeking for an entity
both with regard to the fact  t h a t  i t  i s  and with regard to its Being  a s  i
t    i  s.(2)  This  cognizant  seeking  can  take  the  form  of  ‘investigating’
[“Untersuchen”],  in  which  one  lays  bare  that  which  the  question  is  about
and ascertains its character. Any inquiry, as an inquiry about something, has
that which is asked about [sein Gefragtes]. But all inquiry about something
is somehow a questioning of something [Anfragen bei…]. So in addition to
what  is  asked  about,  an  inquiry  has  that  which  is  interrogated  [ein
Befragtes].  In  investigative  questions—that  is,  in  questions  which  are
specifically 
is  determined  and
conceptualized.  Furthermore,  in  what  is  asked  about  there  lies  also  that
which is to be found out by the asking [das Erfragte]; this is what is really
intended:(3)  with  this  the  inquiry  reaches  its  goal.  Inquiry  itself  is  the
behaviour  of  a  questioner,  and  therefore  of  an  entity,  and  as  such  has  its
own  character  of  Being.  When  one  makes  an  inquiry  one  may  do  so  ‘just
casually’  or  one  may  formulate  the  question  explicitly.  The  latter  case  is
peculiar  in  that  the  inquiry  does  not  become  transparent  to  itself  until  all
these  constitutive  factors  of  the  question  have  themselves  become
transparent.
 

theoretical—what 

is  asked  about 

1.  ‘…dann  bedarf  solches  Fragen  der  angemessenen  Durchsichtigkeit’.  The  adjective
‘durchsichtig’  is  one  of  Heidegger’s  favourite  expressions,  and  means  simply  ‘transparent’,
‘perspicuous’, something that one can ‘see through’. We shall ordinarily translate it by ‘transparent’.
See H. 146 for further discussion.

2. ‘…in seinem Dass- und Sosein’.
3. ‘…das eigentlich Intendierte…’ The adverb ‘eigentlich’ occurs very often in this work. It may
be used informally where one might write ‘really’ or ‘on its part’, or in a much stronger sense, where
something like ‘genuinely’ or ‘authentically’ would be more appropriate. It is not always possible to
tell which meaning Heidegger has in mind. In the contexts which seem relatively informal we shall
write ‘really’; in the more technical passages we shall write ‘authentically’, reserving ‘genuinely’ for
‘genuin’  or  ‘echt’.  The  reader  must  not  confuse  this  kind  of  ‘authenticity’  with  the  kind,  which
belongs  to  an  ‘authentic  text’  or  an  ‘authentic  account’.  See  H.  42  for  further  discussion.  In  the
present  passage, the verb ‘intendieren’  is presumably used in the medieval sense of ‘intending’,  as
adapted and modified by Brentano and Husserl.

The question about the meaning of Being is to be formulated. We  must

therefore discuss it with an eye to these structural items.

Inquiry,  as  a  kind  of  seeking,  must  be  guided  beforehand  by  what  is
sought.  So  the  meaning  of  Being  must  already  be  available  to  us  in  some
way.  As  we  have  intimated,  we  always  conduct  our  activities  in  an
understanding  of  Being.  Out  of  this  understanding  arise  both  the  explicit
question of the meaning of Being and the tendency that leads us towards its
conception.  We  do  not  know  what  ‘Being’  means.  But  even  if  we  ask,
‘What is “Being”?’, we keep within an understanding of the ‘is’, though we
are unable to fix conceptually what that ‘is’ signifies. We do not even know
the horizon in terms of which that meaning is to be grasped and fixed. But
this vague average understanding of Being is still a Fact.

H. 6

 

However much this understanding of Being (an understanding which is
already  available  to  us)  may  fluctuate  and  grow  dim,  and  border  on  mere
acquaintance  with  a  word,  its  very  indefiniteness  is  itself  a  positive
phenomenon which needs to be clarified. An investigation of the meaning
of Being cannot be expected to give this clarification at the outset. If we are
to  obtain  the  clue  we  need  for  Interpreting  this  average  understanding  of
Being,  we  must  first  develop  the  concept  of  Being.  In  the  light  of  this
concept  and  the  ways  in  which  it  may  be  explicitly  understood,  we  can
make  out  what  this  obscured  or  still  unillumined  understanding  of  Being
means,  and  what  kinds  of  obscuration—or  hindrance  to  an  explicit
illumination—of the meaning of Being are possible and even inevitable.

Further, this vague average understanding of Being may be so infiltrated
with traditional theories and opinions about Being that these remain hidden
as sources of the way in which it is prevalently understood. What we seek
when we inquire into Being is not something entirely unfamiliar, even if at
first(1) we cannot grasp it at all.

In the question which we are to work out, what is asked about is  Being
—that  which  determines  entities  as  entities,  that  on  the  basis  of  which
[woraufhin] entities are already understood, however we may discuss them
in  detail.  The  Being  of  entities  ‘is’  not  itself  an  entity.  If  we  are  to
understand  the  problem  of  Being,  our  first  philosophical  step  consists  in
μῦθόν  τινα  διηγεῖσθαι,(v)  in  not  ‘telling  a  story’—that  is  to  say,  in  not

defining  entities  as  entities  by  tracing  them  back  in  their  origin  to  some
other entities, as if Being had the character of some possible entity. Hence
Being, as that which is asked about, must be exhibited in a way of its own,
essentially  different  from  the  way  in  which  entities  are  discovered.
Accordingly, what is to be found out by the asking—the meaning of Being
—also  demands  that  it  be  conceived  in  a  way  of  its  own,  essentially
contrasting  with  the  concepts  in  which  entities  acquire  their  determinate
signification.
 

v. Plato, Sophistes 242c.

1. ‘zunächst’. This word is of very frequent occurrence in Heidegger, and he will discuss his use
of it on H. 370 below. In ordinary German usage the word may mean ‘at first’, ‘to begin with’, or ‘in
the first instance’, and we shall often translate it in such ways. The word is, however, cognate with
the  adjective  ‘nah’  and  its  superlative  ‘nächst’,  which  we  shall  usually  translate  as  ‘close’  and
‘closest’ respectively; and Heidegger often uses ‘zunächst’ in the sense of ‘most closely’, when he is
describing  the  most  ‘natural’  and  ‘obvious’  experiences  which  we  have  at  an  uncritical  and  pre-
philosophical  level.  We  have  ventured  to  translate  this  Heideggerian  sense  of  ‘zunächst’  as
‘proximally’,  but  there  are  many  border-line  cases  where  it  is  not  clear  whether  Heidegger  has  in
mind  this  special  sense  or  one  of  the  more  general  usages,  and  in  such  cases  we  have  chosen
whatever expression seems stylistically preferable.

 

 

H. 7

In  so  far  as  Being  constitutes  what  is  asked  about,  and  “Being”  means
the  Being  of  entities,  then  entities  themselves  turn  out  to  be  what  is
interrogated. These are, so to speak, questioned as regards their Being. But
if the characteristics of their Being can be yielded without falsification, then
these  entities  must,  on  their  part,  have  become  accessible  as  they  are  in
themselves.  When  we  come  to  what  is  to  be  interrogated,  the  question  of
Being  requires  that  the  right  way  of  access  to  entities  shall  have  been
obtained  and  secured  in  advance.  But  there  are  many  things  which  we
designate as ‘being’ [“seiend”], and we do so in various senses. Everything
we  talk  about,  everything  we  have  in  view,  everything  towards  which  we
comport ourselves in any way, is being; what we are is being, and so is how
we are. Being lies in the fact that something is, and in its Being as it is; in
Reality;  in  presence-at-hand;  in  subsistence;  in  validity;  in  Dasein;  in  the
‘there  is’.(1)  In  which  entities  is  the  meaning  of  Being  to  be  discerned?
From which entities is the disclosure of Being to take its departure? Is the
starting-point optional, or does some particular entity have priority when we

come to work out the question of Being? Which entity shall we take for our
example, and in what sense does it have priority?

If  the  question  about  Being  is  to  be  explicitly  formulated  and  carried
through in such a manner as to be completely transparent to itself, then any
treatment  of  it  in  line  with  the  elucidations  we  have  given  requires  us  to
explain how Being is to be looked at, how its meaning is to be understood
and conceptually grasped; it requires us to prepare the way for choosing the
right entity for our example, and to work out the genuine way of access to
it. Looking at something, understanding and conceiving it, choosing, access
to  it—all  these  ways  of  behaving  are  constitutive  for  our  inquiry,  and
therefore  are  modes  of  Being  for  those  particular  entities  which  we,  the
inquirers, are ourselves. Thus to work out the question of Being adequately,
we must make an entity—the inquirer—transparent in his own Being. The
very asking of this question is an entity’s mode of Being; and as such it gets
its essential character from what is inquired about—namely, Being.
 

1. ‘Sein liegt im Dass- und Sosein, in Realität, Vorhandenheit, Bestand, Geltung, Dasein, im “es

gibt”.’ On ‘Vorhandenheit’ (‘presence-at-hand’) see note 1, H. 25. On ‘Dasein’, see note 1, H. 8.

This entity which each of us is himself and which includes inquiring as
one of the possibilities of its Being, we shall denote by the term “Dasein”.
(1) If we are to formulate our question explicitly and transparently, we must
first give a proper explication of an entity (Dasein), with regard to its Being.
Is  there  not,  however,  a  manifest  circularity  in  such  an  undertaking?  If
we must first define an entity in its Being, and if we want to formulate the
question of Being only on this basis, what is this but going in a circle? In
working out our question, have we not ‘presupposed’ something which only
the  answer  can  bring?  Formal  objections  such  as  the  argument  about
‘circular  reasoning’,  which  can  easily  be  cited  at  any  time  in  the  study  of
first principles, are always sterile when one is considering concrete ways of
investigating.  When  it  comes  to  understanding  the  matter  at  hand,  they
carry no weight and keep us from penetrating into the field of study.

H. 8

 

But  factically(2)  there  is  no  circle  at  all  in  formulating  our  question  as
we have described. One can determine the nature of entities in their Being

without necessarily having the explicit concept of the meaning of Being at
one’s disposal. Otherwise there could have been no ontological knowledge
heretofore.  One  would  hardly  deny  that  factically  there  has  been  such
knowledge.(3) Of course ‘Being’ has been presupposed in all ontology up
till now, but not as a concept at one’s disposal—not as the sort of thing we
are seeking. This ‘presupposing’ of Being has rather the character of taking
a look at it beforehand, so that in the light of it the entities presented to us
get provisionally Articulated in their Being.
 

1.  The  word  ‘Dasein’  plays  so  important  a  role  in  this  work  and  is  already  so  familiar  to  the
English-speaking reader who has read about Heidegger, that it seems simpler to leave it untranslated
except in the relatively rare passages in which Heidegger himself breaks it up with a hypthen (‘Da-
sein’)  to  show  its  etymological  construction:  literally  ‘Being-there’.  Though  in  traditional  German
philosophy it may be used quite generally to stand for almost any kind of Being or ‘existence’ which
we can say that something has (the ‘existence’ of God, for example), in everyday usage it tends to be
used  more  narrowly  to  stand  for  the  kind  of  Being  that  belongs  to  persons. Heidegger  follows  the
everyday  usage  in  this  respect,  but  goes  somewhat  further  in  that  he  often  uses  it  to  stand  for  any
person who has such Being, and who is thus an ‘entity’ himself. See H. 11 below.

2. ‘faktisch’. While this word can often be translated simply as ‘in fact’ or ‘as a matter of fact’, it
is  used  both  as  an  adjective  and  as  an  adverb  and  is  so  characteristic  of  Heidegger’s  style  that  we
shall as a rule translate it either as ‘factical’ or as ‘factically’, thus preserving its connection with the
important  noun  ‘Faktizität’  (‘facticity’),  and  keeping  it  distinct  from  ‘tatsächlich’  (‘factual’)  and
‘wirklich’  (‘actual’).  See  the  discussion  of  ‘Tatsächlichkeit’  and  ‘Faktizität’  in  Sections  12  and  29
below (H. 56, 135).

3. ‘…deren faktischen Bestand man wohl nicht leugnen wird’.

to 

This guiding activity of taking a look at Being arises from the average
understanding  of  Being  in  which  we  always  operate  and  which  in  the  end
belongs 
itself.  Such
the  essential  constitution(1)  of  Dasein 
‘presupposing’ has nothing to do with laying down an axiom from which a
sequence  of  propositions  is  deductively  derived.  It  is  quite  impossible  for
there  to  be  any  ‘circular  argument’  in  formulating  the  question  about  the
meaning  of  Being;  for  in  answering  this  question,  the  issue  is  not  one  of
grounding something by such a derivation; it is rather one of laying bare the
grounds for it and exhibiting them.(2)

In the question of the meaning of Being there is no ‘circular reasoning’
but rather a remarkable ‘relatedness backward or forward’ which what we
are asking about (Being) bears to the inquiry itself as a mode of Being of an
entity.  Here  what  is  asked  about  has  an  essential  pertinence  to  the  inquiry
itself,  and  this  belongs  to  the  ownmost  meaning  [eigensten  Sinn]  of  the
question of Being. This only means, however, that there is a way—perhaps

even a very special one—in which entities with the character of Dasein are
related to the question of Being. But have we not thus demonstrated that a
certain kind of entity has a priority with regard to its Being? And have we
not thus presented that entity which shall serve as the primary example to
be  interrogated  in  the  question  of  Being?  So  far  our  discussion  has  not
demonstrated Dasein’s priority, nor has it shown decisively whether Dasein
may  possibly  or  even  necessarily  serve  as  the  primary  entity  to  be
interrogated. But indeed something like a priority of Dasein has announced
itself.
 

1. ‘Wesensverfassung’. ‘Verfassung’ is the standard word for the ‘constitution’ of a nation or any
political  organization,  but  it  is  also  used  for  the  ‘condition’  or  ‘state’  in  which  a  person  may  find
himself. Heidegger seldom uses the word in either of these senses; but he does use it in ways which
are  somewhat  analogous.  In  one  sense  Dasein’s  ‘Verfassung’  is  its  ‘constitution’,  the  way  it  is
constituted,  ‘sa  condition  humaine’.  In  another  sense  Dasein  may  have  several  ‘Verfassungen’  as
constitutive  ‘states’  or  factors  which  enter  into  its  ‘constitution’.  We  shall,  in  general,  translate
‘Verfassung’ as ‘constitution’ or ‘constitutive state’ according to the context; but in passages where
‘constitutive  state’  would  be  cumbersome  and  there  is  little  danger  of  ambiguity,  we  shall  simply
write ‘state’. These states, however, must always be thought of as constitutive and essential, not as
temporary  or  transitory  stages  like  the  ‘state’  of  one’s  health  or  the  ‘state  of  the  nation’.  When
Heidegger uses the word ‘Konstitution’, we shall usually indicate this by capitalizing ‘Constitution’.
2. ‘...weil es in der Beantwortung der Frage nicht um eine ableitende Begründung, sondern um
aufweisende Grund-Freilegung geht.’ Expressions of the form ‘es geht... um...’ appear very often in
this work. We shall usually translate them by variants on ‘...is an issue for...’.

3. The Ontological Priority of the Question of Being

When we pointed out the characteristics of the question of Being, taking
as  our  clue  the  formal  structure  of  the  question  as  such,  we  made  it  clear
that  this  question  is  a  peculiar  one,  in  that  a  series  of  fundamental
considerations is required for working it out, not to mention for solving it.
But  its  distinctive  features  will  come  fully  to  light  only  when  we  have
delimited it adequately with regard to its function, its aim, and its motives.

 

 

H. 9

Hitherto  our  arguments  for  showing  that  the  question  must  be  restated
have been motivated in part by its venerable origin but chiefly by the lack
of a definite answer and even by the absence of any satisfactory formulation

of the question itself. One may, however, ask what purpose this quest ion is
supposed to serve. Does it simply remain—or is it at all—a mere matter for
soaring speculation about the most general of generalities, or is it rather, of
all questions, both the most basic and the most concrete?

Being  is  always  the  Being  of  an  entity.  The  totality  of  entities  can,  in
accordance  with  its  various  domains,  become  a  field  for  laying  bare  and
delimiting certain definite areas of subject-matter. These areas, on their part
(for  instance,  history,  Nature,  space,  life,  Dasein,  language,  and  the  like),
can serve as objects which corresponding scientific investigations may take
as  their  respective  themes.  Scientific  research  accomplishes,  roughly  and
naïvely,  the  demarcation  and  initial  fixing  of  the  areas  of  subject-matter.
The basic structures of any such area have already been worked out after a
fashion  in  our  pre-scientific  ways  of  experiencing  and  interpreting  that
domain of Being in which the area of subject-matter is itself confined. The
‘basic concepts’ which thus arise remain our proximal clues for disclosing
this  area  concretely  for  the  first  time.  And  although  research  may  always
lean  towards  this  positive  approach,  its  real  progress  comes  not  so  much
from  collecting  results  and  storing  them  away  in  ‘manuals’  as  from
inquiring into the ways in which each particular area is basically constituted
[Grundverfassungen]—an inquiry to which we have been driven mostly by
reacting against just such an increase in information.

The  real  ‘movement’  of  the  sciences  takes  place  when  their  basic
concepts  undergo  a  more  or  less  radical  revision  which  is  transparent  to
itself. The level which a science has reached is determined by how far it is
capable of  a  crisis  in  its  basic  concepts.  In  such  immanent  crises  the  very
relationship  between  positively  investigative  inquiry  and  those  things
themselves that are under interrogation comes to a point where it begins to
totter.  Among  the  various  disciplines  everywhere  today  there  are  freshly
awakened tendencies to put research on new foundations.

H. 10

 

Mathematics,  which  is  seemingly  the  most  rigorous  and  most  firmly
constructed of the sciences, has reached a crisis in its ‘foundations’. In the
controversy between the formalists and the intuitionists, the issue is one of
obtaining  and  securing  the  primary  way  of  access  to  what  are  supposedly
the objects of this science. The relativity theory of physics arises  from  the

tendency to exhibit the interconnectedness of Nature as it is ‘in itself’. As a
theory  of  the  conditions  under  which  we  have  access  to  Nature  itself,  it
seeks to preserve the changelessness of the laws of motion by ascertaining
all relativities, and thus comes up against the question of the structure of its
own  given  area  of  study—the  problem  of  matter.  In  biology  there  is  an
awakening  tendency  to  inquire  beyond  the  definitions  which  mechanism
and vitalism have given for “life” and “organism”, and to define anew the
kind of Being which belongs to the living as such. In those humane sciences
which  are  historiological  in  character,(1)  the  urge  towards  historical
actuality itself has been strengthened in the course of time by tradition and
by  the  way  tradition  has  been  presented  and  handed  down:  the  history  of
literature is to become the history of problems. Theology is seeking a more
primordial  interpretation  of  man’s  Being  towards  God,  prescribed  by  the
meaning  of  faith  itself  and  remaining  within  it.  It  is  slowly  beginning  to
understand  once  more  Luther’s  insight  that  the  ‘foundation’  on  which  its
system  of  dogma  rests  has  not  arisen  from  an  inquiry  in  which  faith  is
primary, and that conceptually this ‘foundation’ not only is inadequate for
the problematic of theology, but conceals and distorts it.

Basic  concepts  determine  the  way  in  which  we  get  an  understanding
beforehand of the area of subject-matter underlying all the objects a science
takes  as  its  theme,  and  all  positive  investigation  is  guided  by  this
understanding. Only after the area itself has been explored beforehand in a
corresponding  manner  do  these  concepts  become  genuinely  demonstrated
and  ‘grounded’.  But  since  every  such  area  is  itself  obtained  from  the
domain  of  entities  themselves,  this  preliminary  research,  from  which  the
basic  concepts  are  drawn,  signifies  nothing  else  than  an  interpretation  of
those entities with regard to their basic state of Being. Such research must
run ahead of the positive sciences, and it can. Here  the  work  of  Plato  and
Aristotle is evidence enough. Laying the foundations for the sciences in this
way  is  different  in  principle  from  the  kind  of  ‘logic’  which  limps  along
after,  investigating  the  status  of  some  science  as  it  chances  to  find  it,  in
order to discover its ‘method’.
 

‘Historie’  and 

1.  ‘In  den  historischen  Geisteswissenschaften...’  Heidegger  makes  much  of  the  distinction
between 
‘historisch’  and
‘geschichtlich’. ‘Historie’ stands for what Heidegger calls a ‘science of history’. (See H. 375, 378.)
‘Geschichte’ usually stands for the kind of ‘history’ that actually happens. We shall as a rule translate
these respectively as ‘historiology’ and ‘history’, following similar conventions in handling the two
adjectives. See especially Sections 6 and 76 below.

the  corresponding  adjectives 

‘Geschichte’  and 

Laying the foundations, as we have described it, is rather a productive
logic—in the sense that it leaps ahead, as it were, into some area of Being,
discloses it for the first time in the constitution of its Being, and, after thus
arriving  at  the  structures  within  it,  makes  these  available  to  the  positive
sciences  as  transparent  assignments  for  their  inquiry.(1)  To  give  an
example, what is philosophically primary is neither a theory of the concept-
formation  of  historiology  nor  the  theory  of  historiological  knowledge,  nor
yet  the  theory  of  history  as  the  Object  of  historiology;  what  is  primary  is
rather  the  Interpretation  of  authentically  historical  entities  as  regards  their
historicality.(2)  Similarly  the  positive  outcome  of  Kant’s  Critique  of  Pure
Reason  lies  in  what  it  has  contributed  towards  the  working  out  of  what
belongs  to  any  Nature  whatsoever,  not  in  a  ‘theory’  of  knowledge.  His
transcendental logic is an a priori logic for the subject-matter of that area of
Being called “Nature”.

H. 11

 

But  such  an  inquiry  itself—ontology  taken  in  the  widest  sense  without
favouring  any  particular  ontological  directions  or  tendencies—requires  a
further clue. Ontological inqury is indeed more primordial, as over against
the  ontical(3)  inquiry  of  the  positive  sciences.  But  it  remains  itself  naïve
and opaque if in its researches into the Being of entities it fails to discuss
the meaning of Being in general. And the ontological task of a genealogy of
the  different  possible  ways  of  Being  (which  is  not  to  be  constructed
deductively) is precisely of such a sort as to require that we first come to an
understanding of ‘what we really mean by this expression “Being” ’.

The  question  of  Being  aims  therefore  at  ascertaining  the  a  priori
conditions  not  only  for  the  possibility  of  the  sciences  which  examine
entities as entities of such and such a type, and, in so doing, already operate
with  an  understanding  of  Being,  but  also  for  the  possibility  of  those
ontologies  themselves  which  are  prior  to  the  ontical  sciences  and  which
provide  their  foundations. Basically,  all  ontology,  no  matter  how  rich  and
firmly compacted a system of categories it has at its disposal, remains blind
and perverted from its ownmost aim, if it has not first adequately clarified
the  meaning  of  Being,  and  conceived  this  clarification  as  its  fundamental
task.

Ontological  research  itself,  when  properly  understood,  gives  to  the
question  of  Being  an  ontological  priority  which  goes  beyond  mere
resumption  of  a  venerable  tradition  and  advancement  with  a  problem  that
has  hitherto  been  opaque.  But  this  objectively  scientific  priority  is  not  the
only one.
 

1. ‘…als durchsichtige Anweisungen des Fragens...’
2.  ‘…sondern  die  Intepretation  des  eigentlich  geschichtlich  Seienden  auf  seine  Ges.
chichtlichkeit’. We shall translate the frequently occurring term ‘Geschichtlichkeit’ as ‘historicality’.
Heidegger  very  occasionally  uses  the  term  ‘Historizität’,  as  on  H.  20  below,  and  this  will  be
translated as ‘historicity’.

3.  While  the  terms  ‘ontisch’  (‘ontical’)  and  ‘ontologisch’  (‘ontological’)  are  not  explicitly
defined, their meanings will emerge rather clearly. Ontological inquiry is concerned primarily with
Being; ontical inquiry is concerned primarily with entities and the facts about them.

4. The Ontical Priority of the Question of Being

 

 

H. 12

Science in general may be defined as the totality established through an
interconnection of true propositions.(1) This definition is not complete, nor
does  it  reach  the  meaning  of  science.  As  ways  in  which  man  behaves,
sciences  have  the  manner  of  Being  which  this  entity—man  himself—
possesses. This entity we denote by the term “Dasein”. Scientific  research
is not the only manner of Being which this entity can have, nor is it the one
which  lies  closest.  Moreover,  Dasein  itself  has  a  special  distinctiveness  as
compared with other entities, and it is worth our while to bring this to view
in a provisional way. Here our discussion must anticipate later analyses, in
which our results will be authentically exhibited for the first time.

Dasein  is  an  entity  which  does  not  just  occur  among  other  entities.
Rather  it  is  ontically  distinguished  by  the  fact  that,  in  its  very  Being,  that
Being  is  an  issue  for  it.  But  in  that  case,  this  is  a  constitutive  state  of
Dasein’s Being, and this implies that Dasein, in its Being, has a relationship
towards that Being—a relationship which itself is one of Being.(2) And this
means further that there is some way in which Dasein understands itself in
its Being, and that to some degree it does so explicitly. It is peculiar to this
entity  that  with  and  through  its  Being,  this  Being  is  disclosed  to  it.

Understanding of Being is itself a definite characteristic of Dasein’s Being.
Dasein is ontically distinctive in that it is ontological.(3)

Here  “Being-ontological”  is  not  yet  tantamount  to  “developing  an
ontology”. So if we should reserve the term “ontology” for that theoretical
inquiry which is explicitly devoted to the meaning of entities, then what we
have  had  in  mind  in  speaking  of  Dasein’s  “Being-ontological”  is  to  be
designated  as  something  “pre-ontological”.  It  does  not  signify  simply
“being-ontical”,  however,  but  rather  “being  in  such  a  way  that  one  has  an
understanding of Being”.
 

1. ‘...das Ganze eines Begründungszusammenhanges wahrer Sätze...’ See H. 357 below.
2  .‘Zu  dieser  Seinsverfassung  des  Daseins  gehört  aber  dann,  dass  es  in  seinem  Sein  zu  diesem
Sein  ein  Seinsverhältnis  hat.’  This  passage  is  ambiguous  and  might  also  be  read  as:  ‘...and  this
implies that Dasein, in its Being towards this Being, has a relationship of Being.’

3. ‘...dass es ontologisch ist’. As ‘ontologisch’ may be either an adjective or an adverb, we might
also  write:  ‘...that  it  is  ontologically’.  A  similar  ambiguity  occurs  in  the  two  following  sentences,
where we read ‘Ontologisch-sein’ and ‘ontisch-seiend’ respectively.

That kind of Being towards which Dasein can comport itself in one way
or  another,  and  always  does  comport  itself  somehow,  we  call  “existence”
[Existenz].  And  because  we  cannot  define  Dasein’s  essence  by  citing  a
“what”  of  the  kind  that  pertains  to  a  subject-matter  [eines  sachhaltigen
Was], and because its essence lies rather in the fact that in each case it has
its Being to be, and has it as its own,(1) we have chosen to designate this
entity  as  “Dasein”,  a  term  which  is  purely  an  expression  of  its  Being  [als
reiner Seinsausdruck].

Dasein always understands itself in terms of its existence—in terms of a
possibility of itself: to be itself or not itself. Dasein has either chosen these
possibilities itself, or got itself into them, or grown up in them already. Only
the particular Dasein decides its existence, whether it does so by taking hold
or  by  neglecting.  The  question  of  existence  never  gets  straightened  out
except  through  existing  itself.  The  understanding  of  oneself  which  leads
along this way we call “existentiell”.(2) The question of existence is one of
Dasein’s  ontical  ‘affairs’.  This  does  not  require  that  the  ontological
structure  of  existence  should  be  theoretically  transparent.  The  question
about  that  structure  aims  at  the  analysis  [Auseinanderlegung]  of  what
constitutes  existence.  The  context  [Zusammenhang]  of  such  structures  we
call “existentiality”. Its analytic has the character of an understanding which
is not existentiell, but rather existential. The  task  of  an  existential  analytic

of Dasein has been delineated in advance, as regards both its possibility and
its necessity, in Dasein’s ontical constitution.

H. 13

 

So  far  as  existence  is  the  determining  character  of  Dasein,  the
ontological  analytic  of  this  entity  always  requires  that  existentiality  be
considered beforehand. By “existentiality” we understand the state of Being
that  is  constitutive  for  those  entities  that  exist.  But  in  the  idea  of  such  a
constitutive state of Being, the idea of Being is already included. And thus
even the possibility of carrying through the analytic of Dasein depends on
working out beforehand the question about the meaning of Being in general.
Sciences  are  ways  of  Being  in  which  Dasein  comports  itself  towards
entities  which  it  need  not  be  itself.  But  to  Dasein,  Being  in  a  world  is
something  that  belongs  essentially.  Thus  Dasein’s  understanding  of  Being
pertains with equal primordiality both to an understanding of something like
a  ‘world’,  and  to  the  understanding  of  the  Being  of  those  entities  which
become accessible within the world.(3) So whenever an ontology takes for
its theme entities whose character of Being is other than that of Dasein, it
has its own foundation and motivation in Dasein’s own ontical structure, in
which  a  pre-ontological  understanding  of  Being  is  comprised  as  a  definite
characteristic.
 

1. ‘…dass es je sein Sein als seiniges zu sein hat…’
2. We shall translate ‘existenziell’ by ‘existentiell’, and ‘existenzial’ by ‘existential’. There seems

to be little reason for resorting to the more elaborate neologisms proposed by other writers.

3. ‘…innerhalb der Welt...’ Heidegger uses at least three expressions which might be translated
as ‘in the world’: ‘innerhalb der Welt’, ‘in der Welt’, and the adjective (or adverb) ‘innerweltlich’.
We shall translate these respectively by ‘within the world’, ‘in the world’, and ‘within-the-world’.

Therefore fundamental  ontology, from  which  alone  all  other  ontologies

can take their rise, must be sought in the existential analytic of Dasein.

Dasein accordingly takes priority over all other entities in several ways.
The first priority is an ontical one: Dasein is an entity whose Being has the
determinate  character  of  existence.  The  second  priority  is  an  ontological
one:  Dasein 
thus
determinative for it. But with equal primordiality Dasein also possesses—as
constitutive  for  its  understanding  of  existence—an  understanding  of  the

itself  ‘ontological’,  because  existence 

in 

is 

is 

Being of all entities of a character other than its own. Dasein has therefore a
third  priority  as  providing  the  ontico-ontological  condition  for  the
possibility of any ontologies. Thus Dasein has turned out to be, more than
any other entity, the one which must first be interrogated ontologically.

H. 14

 

But  the  roots  of  the  existential  analytic,  on  its  part,  are  ultimately
existentiell, that is, ontical. Only if the inquiry of philosophical research is
itself seized upon in an existentiell manner as a possibility of the Being of
each  existing  Dasein,  does  it  become  at  all  possible  to  disclose  the
existentiality  of  existence  and  to  undertake  an  adequately  founded
ontological problematic. But with this, the ontical priority of the question of
being has also become plain.

Dasein’s ontico-ontological priority was seen quite early, though Dasein
itself was not grasped in its genuine ontological structure, and did not even
become a problem in which this structure was sought. Aristotle says: ἡ ψυχὴ
τὰ ὄντα πώς ἐστιν.(vi) “Man’s soul is, in a certain way, entities.” The ‘soul’
which makes up the Being of man αἴσθησις and νόησις among  its  ways  of
Being, and in these it discovers all entities, both in the fact  t h a t  they are,
and in their Being  a s  they are—that is, always in their Being. Aristotle’s
principle, which points back to the ontological thesis of Parmenides, is one
which Thomas Aquinas has taken up in a characteristic discussion. Thomas
is engaged in the task of deriving the ‘transcendentia’—those characters of
Being  which  lie  beyond  every  possible  way  in  which  an  entity  may  be
classified  as  coming  under  some  generic  kind  of  subject-matter  (every
modus specialis entis), and which belong necessarily to anything, whatever
it  may  be.  Thomas  has  to  demonstrate  that  the  verum  is  such  a
transcendens. He does this by invoking an entity which, in accordance with
its very manner of Being, is properly suited to ‘come together with’ entities
of  any  sort  whatever.  This  distinctive  entity,  the  ens  quod  natum  est
convenire  cum  omni  ente,  is  the  soul  (anima).(vii)  Here  the  priority  of
‘Dasein’  over  all  other  entities  emerges,  although  it  has  not  been
ontologically clarified. This priority has obviously nothing in common with
a vicious subjectivizing of the totality of entities.

By  indicating  Dasein’s  ontico-ontological  priority  in  this  provisional
manner, we have grounded our demonstration that the question of Being is

ontico-ontologically distinctive. But when we analysed the structure of this
question as such (Section 2), we came up against a distinctive way in which
this  entity  functions  in  the  very  formulation  of  that  question.  Dasein  then
revealed  itself  as  that  entity  which  must  first  be  worked  out  in  an
ontologically  adequate  manner,  if  the  inquiry  is  to  become  a  transparent
one. But now it has been shown that the ontological analytic of Dasein in
general is what makes up fundamental ontology, so that Dasein functions as
that  entity  which  in  principle  is  to  be  interrogated  beforehand  as  to  its
Being.

vii. Thomas Aquinas, Quaestiones de Veritate, q. I, a l c; cf. the somewhat different and in part
more rigorous way in which he carries out a ‘deduction’ of the transcendentia in  his  opuscule  ‘De
Natura Generis’.

H. 15

 

If to Interpret the meaning of Being becomes our task, Dasein is not only
the  primary  entity  to  be  interrogated;  it  is  also  that  entity  which  already
comports itself in its Being, towards what we are asking about when we ask
this  question.  But  in  that  case  the  question  of  Being  is  nothing  other  than
the  radicalization  of  an  essential  tendency-of-Being  which  belongs  to
Dasein itself—the pre-ontological understanding of Being.

II: THE TWOFOLD TASK IN WORKING OUT THE QUESTION

OF BEING. METHOD AND DESIGN OF OUR INVESTIGATION

 

5. The Ontological Analytic of Dasein as Laying Bare the Horizon for

an Interpretation of the Meaning of Being in General
 

IN designating the tasks of ‘formulating’ the question of Being, we have
shown  not  only  that  we  must  establish  which  entity  is  to  serve  as  our
primary object of interrogation, but also that the right way of access to this
entity is one which we must explicitly make our own and hold secure. We
have already discussed which entity takes over the principal role within the
question of Being. But how are we, as it were, to set our sights towards this
entity,  Dasein,  both  as  something  accessible  to  us  and  as  something  to  be
understood and interpreted?

In demonstrating that Dasein is ontico-ontologically prior, we may have
misled the reader into supposing that this entity must also be what is given
as  ontico-ontologically  primary  not  only  in  the  sense  that  it  can  itself  be
grasped ‘immediately’, but also in that the kind of Being which it possesses
is presented just as ‘immediately’. Ontically, of course, Dasein is not only
close to us—even that which is closest: we are it, each of us, we ourselves.
In spite of this, or rather for just this reason, it is ontologically that which is
farthest. To be sure, its ownmost Being is such that it has an understanding
of that Being, and already maintains itself in each case as if its Being has
been interpreted in some manner. But we are certainly not saying that when
Dasein’s own Being is thus interpreted pre-ontologically in the way which
lies closest, this interpretation can be taken over as an appropriate clue, as if
this way of understanding Being is what must emerge when one’s ownmost
state of Being is considered(1) as an ontological theme. The kind of Being
which belongs to Dasein is rather such that, in understanding its own Being,
it has a tendency to do so in terms of that entity towards which it comports
itself proximally and in a way which is essentially constant—in terms of the
‘world’. In Dasein itself, and therefore in its own understanding of Being,

the  way  the  world  is  understood  is,  as  we  shall  show,  reflected  back
ontologically upon the way in which Dasein itself gets interpreted.
 

1. ‘Besinnung’. The earliest editions have ‘Bestimmung’ instead.

H. 16

 

Thus because Dasein is ontico-ontologically prior, its own specific state
of  Being  (if  we  understand  this  in  the  sense  of  Dasein’s  ‘categorial
structure’) remains concealed from it. Dasein is ontically ‘closest’ to itself
and ontologically farthest; but pre-ontologically it is surely not a stranger.

Here  we  have  merely  indicated  provisionally  that  an  Interpretation  of
this  entity  is  confronted  with  peculiar  difficulties  grounded  in  the  kind  of
Being  which  belongs  to  the  object  taken  as  our  theme  and  to  the  very
behaviour  of  so  taking  it.  These  difficulties  are  not  grounded  in  any
shortcomings of the cognitive powers with which we are endowed, or in the
lack of a suitable way of conceiving—a lack which seemingly would not be
hard to remedy.

in  philosophical  psychology, 

Not only, however, does an understanding of Being belong to Dasein, but
this  understanding  develops  or  decays  along  with  whatever  kind  of  Being
Dasein may possess at the time; accordingly there are many ways in which
it has been interpreted, and these are all at Dasein’s disposal. Dasein’s ways
of  behaviour,  its  capacities,  powers,  possibilities,  and  vicissitudes,  have
in
been  studied  with  varying  extent 
anthropology,  ethics,  and  ‘political  science’,  in  poetry,  biography,  and  the
writing  of  history,  each  in  a  different  fashion.  But  the  question  remains
whether  these  interpretations  of  Dasein  have  been  carried  through  with  a
primordial  existentiality  comparable  to  whatever  existentiell  primordiality
they  may  have  possessed.  Neither  of  these  excludes  the  other  but  they  do
not  necessarily  go  together.  Existentiell  interpretation  can  demand  an
existential  analytic,  if  indeed  we  conceive  of  philosophical  cognition  as
something possible and necessary. Only when the basic structures of Dasein
have  been  adequately  worked  out  with  explicit  orientation  towards  the
problem  of  Being  itself,  will  what  we  have  hitherto  gained  in  interpreting
Dasein get its existential justification.

Thus  an  analytic  of  Dasein  must  remain  our  first  requirement  in  the
question  of Being.  But in  that case  the  problem  of obtaining  and securing

the kind of access which will lead to Dasein, becomes even more a burning
one.  To  put  it  negatively,  we  have  no  right  to  resort  to  dogmatic
constructions and to apply just any idea of Being and actuality to this entity,
no  matter  how  ‘self-evident’  that  idea  may  be;  nor  may  any  of  the
‘categories’  which such an idea  prescribes be forced  upon  Dasein without
proper  ontological  consideration.  We  must  rather  choose  such  a  way  of
access  and  such  a  kind  of  interpretation  that  this  entity  can  show  itself  in
itself and from itself [an ihm selbst von ihm selbst her].

H. 17

 

And this means that it is to be shown as it is proximally and for the most
part—in its average everydayness.(1) In this everydayness there are certain
structures  which  we  shall  exhibit—not  just  any  accidental  structures,  but
essential  ones  which,  in  every  kind  of  Being  that  factical  Dasein  may
possess,  persist  as  determinative  for  the  character  of  its  Being.  Thus  by
having  regard  for  the  basic  state  of  Dasein’s  everydayness,  we  shall  bring
out the Being of this entity in a preparatory fashion.

if  anything 

When taken in this way, the analytic of Dasein remains wholly oriented
towards the guiding task of working out the question of Being. Its limits are
thus  determined.  It  cannot  attempt  to  provide  a  complete  ontology  of
Dasein,  which  assuredly  must  be  constructed 
like  a
‘philosophical’ anthropology is to have a philosophically adequate basis.(2)
If  our  purpose  is  to  make  such  an  anthropology  possible,  or  to  lay  its
ontological  foundations,  our  Interpretation  will  provide  only  some  of  the
‘pieces’, even though they are by no means inessential ones. Our analysis of
Dasein,  however,  is  not  only  incomplete;  it  is  also,  in  the  first  instance,
provisional.  It  merely  brings  out  the  Being  of  this  entity,  without
Interpreting  its meaning.  It  is  rather a preparatory  procedure by  which the
horizon for the most primordial way of interpreting Being may be laid bare.
Once  we  have  arrived  at  the  horizon,  this  preparatory  analytic  of  Dasein
will have to be repeated on a higher and authentically ontological basis.

We  shall  point  to  temporality(3)  as  the  meaning  of  the  Being  of  that
entity which we call “Dasein”. If this is to be demonstrated, those structures
of  Dasein  which  we  shall  provisionally  exhibit  must  be  Interpreted  over
again  as  modes  of  temporality.  In  thus  interpreting  Dasein  as  temporality,
however,  we  shall  not  give  the  answer  to  our  leading  question  as  to  the

meaning  of  Being  in  general.  But  the  ground  will  have  been  prepared  for
obtaining such an answer.
 

1.  ‘Und  zwar  soll  sie  das  Seiende  in  dem  zeigen,  wie  es  zunächst  und  zumeist  ist,  in  seiner
durchschnittlichen Alltäglichkeit.’ The phrase ‘zunächst und zumeist’ is one that occurs many times,
though Heidegger does not explain it until Section 71 (H. 370 below), where ‘Alltäglichkeit’ too gets
explained. On ‘zunächst’ see our note 1, H. 6.

2. The ambiguity of the pronominal references in this sentence and the one before it, reflects a
similar ambiguity in the German. (The English-speaking reader should be reminded that the kind of
philosophical ‘anthropology’ which Heidegger has in mind is a study of man in the widest sense, and
is not to be confused with the empirical sciences of ‘physical’ and ‘cultural’ anthropology.)

3.  ‘Zeitlichkeit’.  While  it  is  tempting  to  translate  the  adjective  ‘zeitlich’  and  the  noun
‘Zeitlichkeit’  by  their  most  obvious  English  cognates,  ‘timely’  and  ‘timeliness’,  this  would  be
entirely  misleading;  for  ‘temporal’  and  ‘temporality’  come  much  closer  to  what  Heidegger  has  in
mind, not only when he is discussing these words in their popular senses (as he does on the following
page)  but  even  when  he  is  using  them  in  his  own  special  sense,  as  in  Section  65  below.  (See
especially H. 326 below, where ‘Zeitlichkeit’ is defined.) On the other hand, he occasionally uses the
noun ‘Temporalität’ and the adjective ‘temporal’ in a sense which he will explain later (H. 19). We
shall translate these by ‘Temporality’ and ‘Temporal’, with initial capitals.

H. 18

 

We have already intimated that Dasein has a pre-ontological Being as its
ontically  constitutive  state.  Dasein is in  such  a  way  as  to    b  e    something
which  understands  something  like  Being.(1)  Keeping  this  interconnection
firmly in mind, we shall show that whenever Dasein tacitly understands and
interprets something like Being, it does so with time as its standpoint. Time
must be brought to light—and genuinely conceived—as the horizon for all
understanding of Being and for any way of interpreting it. In order for us to
discern this, time needs to be explicated primordially as the horizon for the
understanding of Being, and in terms of temporality as the Being of Dasein,
which understands Being. This task as a whole requires that the conception
of  time  thus  obtained  shall  be  distinguished  from  the  way  in  which  it  is
ordinarily  understood.  This  ordinary  way  of  understanding  it  has  become
explicit  in  an  interpretation  precipitated  in  the  traditional  concept  of  time,
which has persisted from Aristotle to Bergson and even later. Here we must
make clear that this conception of time and, in general, the ordinary way of
understanding it, have sprung from temporality, and we must show how this
has  come  about.  We  shall  thereby  restore  to  the  ordinary  conception  the
autonomy which is its rightful due, as against Bergson’s thesis that the time
one has in mind in this conception is space.

and 

entities 

(spatial 

‘non-temporal’ 

‘Time’  has  long  functioned  as  an  ontological—or  rather  an  ontical—
criterion for naïvely discriminating various realms of entities. A distinction
has been made between ‘temporal’ entities (natural processes and historical
and  numerical
happenings) 
relationships). We are accustomed to contrasting the ‘timeless’ meaning of
propositions with the ‘temporal’ course of propositional assertions. It is also
held  that  there  is  a  ‘cleavage’  between  ‘temporal’  entities  and  the  ‘supra-
temporal’ eternal, and efforts are made to bridge this over. Here ‘temporal’
always  means  simply  being  [seiend]  ‘in  time’—a  designation  which,
admittedly, is still pretty obscure. The Fact remains that time, in the sense
of ‘being [sein] in time’, functions as a criterion for distinguishing realms of
Being.  Hitherto  no  one  has  asked  or  troubled  to  investigate  how  time  has
come  to  have  this  distinctive  ontological  function,  or  with  what  right
anything  like  time  functions  as  such  a  criterion;  nor  has  anyone  asked
whether  the  authentic  ontological  relevance  which  is  possible  for  it,  gets
expressed when “time” is used in so naïvely ontological a manner. ‘Time’
has acquired this ‘self-evident’ ontological function ‘of its own accord’, so
to speak; indeed it has done so within the horizon of the way it is ordinarily
understood. And it has maintained itself in this function to this day.

In  contrast  to  all  this,  our  treatment  of  the  question  of  the  meaning  of
Being must enable us to show that the central problematic of all ontology is
rooted in the phenomenon of time, if rightly seen and rightly explained, and
we must show how this is the case.

H. 19

 

If Being is to be conceived in terms of time, and if, indeed, its various
modes  and  derivatives  are  to  become  intelligible  in  their  respective
modifications and derivations by taking time into consideration, then Being
itself (and not merely entities, let us say, as entities ‘in time’) is thus made
visible in its ‘temporal’ character. But in that case, ‘temporal’ can no longer
mean  simply  ‘being  in  time’.  Even  the  ‘non-temporal’  and  the  ‘supra-
temporal’ are ‘temporal’ with regard to their Being, and not just privatively
by  contrast  with  something  ‘temporal’  as  an  entity  ‘in  time’,  but  in  a
positive sense,  though  it  is  one  which  we  must  first  explain.  In  both  pre-

philosophical  and  philosophical  usage  the  expression  ‘temporal’  has  been
pre-empted  by 
the  following
the  signification  we  have  cited; 
investigations, however, we shall employ it for another signification. Thus
the  way  in  which  Being  and  its  modes  and  characteristics  have  their
meaning determined primordially in terms of time, is what we shall call its
“Temporal”  determinateness.(1)  Thus  the  fundamental  ontological  task  of
Interpreting Being as such includes working out the Temporality of Being.
In  the  exposition  of  the  problematic  of  Temporality  the  question  of  the
meaning of Being will first be concretely answered.

Because  Being  cannot  be  grasped  except  by 

into
consideration,  the  answer  to  the  question  of  Being  cannot  lie  in  any
proposition that is blind and isolated. The answer is not properly conceived
if  what  it  asserts  propositionally  is  just  passed  along,  especially  if  it  gets
circulated as a free-floating result, so that we merely get informed about a
‘standpoint’ which may perhaps differ from the way this has hitherto been
treated. Whether the answer is a ‘new’ one remains quite superficial and is
of no importance. Its positive character must lie in its being ancient enough
for us to learn to conceive the possibilities which the ‘Ancients’ have made
ready  for  us.  In  its  ownmost  meaning  this  answer  tells  us  that  concrete
ontological research must begin with an investigative inquiry which keeps
within the horizon we have laid bare; and this is all that it tells us.

If, then, the answer to the question of Being is to provide the clues for
our  research,  it  cannot  be  adequate  until  it  brings  us  the  insight  that  the
specific  kind  of  Being  of  ontology  hitherto,  and  the  vicissitudes  of  its
inquiries,  its  findings,  and  its  failures,  have  been  necessitated  in  the  very
character of Dasein.

6. The Task of Destroying the History of Ontology

 

 

H. 20

All research—and not least that which operates within the range of the
central  question  of  Being—is  an  ontical  possibility  of  Dasein.  Dasein’s
Being finds its meaning in temporality. But temporality is also the condition

which  makes  historicality  possible  as  a  temporal  kind  of  Being  which
Dasein itself possesses, regardless of whether or how Dasein is an entity ‘in
time’.  Historicality,  as  a  determinate  character,  is  prior  to  what  is  called
“history” (world-historical historizing).(1)

“Historicality”  stands  for  the  state  of  Being  that  is  constitutive  for
Dasein’s  ‘historizing’  as  such;  only  on  the  basis  of  such  ‘historizing’  is
anything like ‘world-history’ possible or can anything belong historically to
world-history. In its factical Being, any Dasein is as it already was, and it is
‘what’ it already was. It is its past, whether explicitly or not. And this is so
not only in that its past is, as it were, pushing itself along ‘behind’ it, and
that  Dasein  possesses  what  is  past  as  a  property  which  is  still  present-at-
hand and which sometimes has after-effects upon it: Dasein ‘is’ its past in
the  way  of  its own  Being,  which,  to  put  it  roughly,  ‘historizes’  out  of  its
future on each occasion.(2) Whatever the way of being it may have at the
time, and thus with whatever understanding of Being it may possess, Dasein
has grown up both  i n t o  and  i n  a traditional way of interpreting itself: in
terms  of  this  it  understands  itself  proximally  and,  within  a  certain  range,
constantly. By this understanding, the possibilities of its Being are disclosed
and  regulated.  Its  own  past—and  this  always  means  the  past  of  its
‘generation’—is  not  something  which  follows  along  after  Dasein,  but
something which already goes ahead of it.

This  elemental  historicality  of  Dasein  may  remain  hidden  from  Dasein
itself.  But  there  is  a  way  by  which  it  can  be  discovered  and  given  proper
attention. Dasein can discover tradition, preserve it, and study it explicitly.
The discovery of tradition and the disclosure of what it ‘transmits’ and how
this  is  transmitted,  can  be  taken  hold  of  as  a  task  in  its  own  right.  In  this
way  Dasein  brings  itself  into  the  kind  of  Being  which  consists  in
historiological  inquiry  and  research.  But  historiology—or  more  precisely
historicity(3)—is  possible  as  a  kind  of  Being  which  the  inquiring  Dasein
may  possess,  only  because  historicality  is  a  determining  characteristic  for
Dasein in the very basis of its Being.
 

1.  ‘weltgeschichtliches  Geschehen’.  While  the  verb  ‘geschehen’  ordinarily  means  to  ‘happen’,
and  will  often  be  so  translated,  Heidegger  stresses  its  etymological  kinship  to  ‘Geschichte’  or
‘history’.  To  bring  out  this  connection,  we  have  coined  the  verb  ‘historize’,  which  might  be
paraphrased  as  to  ‘happen  in  a  historical  way’;  we  shall  usually  translate  ‘geschehen’  this  way  in
contexts  where  history  is  being  discussed.  We  trust  that  the  reader  will  keep  in  mind  that  such
‘historizing’ is characteristic of all historical entities, and is not the sort of thing that is done primarily

by historians (as ‘philosophizing’, for instance, is done by philosophers). (On ‘world-historical’ see
H. 381 ff.)

2. ‘Das Dasein “ist” seine Vergangenheit in der Weise seines Seins, das, roh gesagt, jeweils aus

seiner Zukunft her “geschieht”.’

3. ‘Historizität’. Cf. note 2, H. 10 above.

If  this  historicality  remains  hidden  from  Dasein,  and  as  long  as  it  so
remains,  Dasein  is  also  denied  the  possibility  of  historiological  inquiry  or
the  discovery  of  history.  If  historiology  is  wanting,  this  is  not  evidence
against Dasein’s historicality; on the contrary, as a deficient mode(1) of this
state of Being, it is evidence for it. Only because it is ‘historical’ can an era
be unhistoriological.

H. 21

 

On  the  other  hand,  if  Dasein  has  seized  upon  its  latent  possibility  not
only of making its own existence transparent to itself but also of inquiring
into  the  meaning  of  existentiality  itself  (that  is  to  say,  of  previously
inquiring into the meaning of Being in general), and if by such inquiry its
eyes have been opened to its own essential historicality, then one cannot fail
to see that the inquiry into Being (the ontico-ontological necessity of which
we  have  already  indicated)  is  itself  characterized  by  historicality.  The
ownmost meaning of Being which belongs to the inquiry into Being as an
historical inquiry, gives us the assignment [Anweisung] of inquiring into the
history of that inquiry itself, that is, of becoming historiological. In working
out  the  question  of  Being,  we  must  heed  this  assignment,  so  that  by
positively  making  the  past  our  own,  we  may  bring  ourselves  into  full
possession of the ownmost possibilities of such inquiry. The question of the
meaning  of  Being  must  be  carried  through  by  explicating  Dasein
beforehand  in  its  temporality  and  historicality;  the  question  thus  brings
itself to the point where it understands itself as historiological.

Our  preparatory  Interpretation  of  the  fundamental  structures  of  Dasein
with  regard  to  the  average  kind  of  Being  which  is  closest  to  it  (a  kind  of
Being  in  which  it  is  therefore  proximally  historical  as  well),  will  make
manifest,  however,  not  only  that  Dasein  is  inclined  to  fall  back  upon  its
world (the world in which it is) and to interpret itself in terms of that world
by  its  reflected  light,  but  also  that  Dasein  simultaneously  falls  prey  to  the
tradition of which it has more or less explicitly taken hold.(2) This tradition

keeps  it  from  providing  its  own  guidance,  whether  in  inquiring  or  in
choosing. This holds true—and by no means least—for that understanding
which  is  rooted  in  Dasein’s  ownmost  Being,  and  for  the  possibility  of
developing it—namely, for ontological understanding.
 

1. ‘defizienter Modus’. Heidegger likes to think of certain characteristics as occurring in various
ways or ‘modes’, among which may be included certain ways of ‘not occurring’ or ‘occurring only to
an inadequate extent’ or, in general, occurring ‘deficiently’. It is as if zero and the negative integers
were to be thought of as representing ‘deficient modes of being a positive integer’.

2.  ‘…das  Dasein  hat  nicht  nur  die  Geneigtheit,  an  seine  Welt,  in  der  es  ist,  zu  verfallen  and
reluzent  aus  ihr  her  sich  auszulegen,  Dasein  verfällt  in  eins  damit  auch  seiner  mehr  oder  minder
ausdrücklich  ergriffenen  Tradition.’  The  verb  ‘verfallen’  is  one  which  Heidegger  will  use  many
times.  Though  we  shall  usually  translate  it  simply  as  ‘fall’,  it  has  the  connotation  of  deteriorating,
collapsing, or falling down. Neither our ‘fall back upon’ nor our ‘falls prey to’ is quite right: but ‘fall
upon’  and  ‘fall  on  to’,  which  are  more  literal,  would  be  misleading  for  ‘an…  zu  verfallen’;  and
though ‘falls to the lot of’ and ‘devolves upon’ would do well for ‘verfällt’ with the dative in other
contexts, they will not do so well here.

When tradition thus becomes master, it does so in such a way that what it
‘transmits’ is made so inaccessible, proximally and for the most part, that it
rather  becomes  concealed.  Tradition  takes  what  has  come  down  to  us  and
delivers  it  over  to  self-evidence;  it  blocks  our  access  to  those  primordial
‘sources’ from which the categories and concepts handed down to us have
been in part quite genuinely drawn.(1) Indeed it makes us forget that they
have had such an origin, and makes us suppose that the necessity of going
back  to  these  sources  is  something  which  we  need  not  even  understand.
Dasein  has  had  its  historicality  so  thoroughly  uprooted  by  tradition  that  it
confines  its  interest  to  the  multiformity  of  possible  types,  directions,  and
standpoints  of  philosophical  activity  in  the  most  exotic  and  alien  of
cultures;  and  by  this  very  interest  it  seeks  to  veil  the  fact  that  it  has  no
ground of its own to stand on. Consequently, despite all its historiological
interests  and  all  its  zeal  for  an  Interpretation  which  is  philologically
the  most
‘objective’  [“sachliche”],  Dasein  no 
elementary conditions which would alone enable it to go back to the past in
a positive manner and make it productively its own.

H. 22

 

We have shown at the outset (Section 1) not only that the question of the
meaning of Being is one that has not been attended to and one that has been

inadequately formulated,  but  that it has become quite forgotten in  spite  of
all our interest in ‘metaphysics’. Greek ontology and its history—which, in
their numerous filiations and distortions, determine the conceptual character
of philosophy even today—prove that when Dasein understands either itself
or Being in general, it does so in terms of the ‘world’, and that the ontology
which  has  thus  arisen  has  deteriorated  [verfällt]  to  a  tradition  in  which  it
gets reduced to something self-evident—merely material for reworking, as
it was for Hegel. In the Middle Ages this uprooted Greek ontology became
a fixed body of doctrine. Its systematics, however, is by no means a mere
joining together of traditional pieces into a single edifice. Though its basic
conceptions of Being have been taken over dogmatically from the Greeks, a
great  deal  of  unpretentious  work  has  been  carried  on  further  within  these
limits.  With  the  peculiar  character  which  the  Scholastics  gave  it,  Greek
ontology  has,  in  its  essentials,  travelled  the  path  that  leads  through  the
‘metaphysics’  and
Disputationes  metaphysicae  of  Suarez 
transcendental  philosophy  of  modern 
the
foundations  and  the  aims  of  Hegel’s  ‘logic’.  In  the  course  of  this  history
certain distinctive domains of Being have come into view and have served
as  the  primary  guides  for  subsequent  problematics:  the  ego  cogito  of
Descartes,  the  subject,  the  “I”,  reason,  spirit,  person.  But  these  all  remain
uninterrogated  as  to  their  Being  and  its  structure,  in  accordance  with  the
thoroughgoing way in which the question of Being has been neglected. It is
rather  the  case  that  the  categorical  content  of  the  traditional  ontology  has
been  carried  over  to  these  entities  with  corresponding  formalizations  and
purely  negative  restrictions,  or  else  dialectic  has  been  called  in  for  the
purpose of Interpreting the substantiality of the subject ontologically.

1.  In  this  passage  Heidegger  juxtaposes  a  number  of  words  beginning  with  the  prefix  ‘über-’:
‘übergibt’  (‘transmits’);  ‘überantwortet’  (‘delivers  over’);  ‘das  Überkommene’  (‘what  has  come
down to us’); ‘überlieferten’ (‘handed down to us’).

If the question of Being is to have its own history made transparent, then
this hardened tradition must be loosened up, and the concealments which it
has brought about(1) must be dissolved. We understand this task as one in
which  by  taking  the  question  of  Being  as  our  clue,  we  are  to  destroy  the
traditional  content  of  ancient  ontology  until  we  arrive  at  those  primordial
experiences in which we achieved our first ways of determining the nature
of Being—the ways which have guided us ever since.

H. 23

 

In thus demonstrating the origin of our basic ontological concepts by an
investigation in which their ‘birth certificate’ is displayed, we have nothing
to  do  with  a  vicious  relativizing  of  ontological  standpoints.  But  this
destruction is just as far from having the negative sense of shaking off the
ontological  tradition.  We  must,  on  the  contrary,  stake  out  the  positive
possibilities  of  that  tradition,  and  this  always  means  keeping  it  within  its
limits;  these  in  turn  are  given  factically  in  the  way  the  question  is
formulated at the time, and in the way the possible field for investigation is
thus bounded off. On its negative side, this destruction does not relate itself
towards the past; its criticism is aimed at ‘today’ and at the prevalent way
of  treating  the  history  of  ontology,  whether  it  is  headed  towards
doxography, towards intellectual history, or towards a history of problems.
But  to  bury  the  past  in  nullity  [Nichtigkeit]  is  not  the  purpose  of  this
destruction;  its  aim  is  positive; its  negative  function  remains  unexpressed
and indirect.

The  destruction  of  the  history  of  ontology  is  essentially  bound  up  with
the way the question of Being is formulated, and it is possible only within
such a formulation. In the framework of our treatise, which aims at working
out  that  question  in  principle,  we  can  carry  out  this  destruction  only  with
regard to stages of that history which are in principle decisive.

In  line  with  the  positive  tendencies  of  this  destruction,  we  must  in  the
first  instance  raise  the  question  whether  and  to  what  extent  the
Interpretation  of  Being  and  the  phenomenon  of  time  have  been  brought
together thematically in the course of the history of ontology, and whether
the problematic of Temporality required for this has ever been worked out
in  principle  or  ever  could  have  been.  The  first  and  only  person  who  has
gone  any  stretch  of  the  way  towards  investigating  the  dimension  of
Temporality or has even let himself be drawn hither by the coercion of the
phenomena  themselves  is  Kant.  Only  when  we  have  established  the
problematic of Temporality, can we succeed in casting light on the obscurity
of his doctrine of the schematism. But this will also show us why this area is
one  which  had  to  remain  closed  off  to  him  in  its  real  dimensions  and  its
central ontological function. Kant himself was aware that he was venturing
into an area of obscurity: ‘This schematism of our understanding as regards
appearances and their mere form is an art hidden in the depths of the human

soul,  the  true  devices  of  which  are  hardly  ever  to  be  divined  from  Nature
and laid uncovered before our eyes.’(i) Here Kant shrinks back, as it were,
in the face of something which must be brought to light as a theme and a
principle if the expression “Being” is to have any demonstrable meaning. In
the end, those very phenomena which will be exhibited under the heading
of ‘Temporality’ in our analysis, are precisely those most covert judgments
of  the  ‘common  reason’  for  which  Kant  says  it  is  the  ‘business  of
philosophers’ to provide an analytic.

H. 24

In pursuing this task of destruction with the problematic of Temporality
as our clue, we shall try to Interpret the chapter on the schematism and the
Kantian  doctrine  of time, taking that chapter as our point of departure.  At
the same time we shall show why Kant could never achieve an insight into
the  problematic  of  Temporality.  There  were  two  things  that  stood  in  his
way: in the first place, he altogether neglected the problem of Being; and, in
connection  with  this,  he  failed  to  provide  an  ontology  with  Dasein  as  its
theme or (to put this in Kantian language) to give a preliminary ontological
analytic  of  the  subjectivity  of  the  subject.  Instead  of  this,  Kant  took  over
Descartes’  position  quite  dogmatically,  notwithstanding  all  the  essential
respect in which he had gone beyond him. Furthermore, in spite of the fact
that he was  bringing  the  phenomenon of time back into the  subject  again,
his  analysis  of  it  remained  oriented  towards  the  traditional  way  in  which
time  had  been  ordinarily  understood;  in  the  long  run  this  kept  him  from
working out the phenomenon of a ‘transcendental determination of time’ in
its own structure and function. Because of this double effect of tradition the
decisive connection between  time  and  the  ‘I  think’  was  shrouded  in  utter
darkness; it did not even become a problem.

In  taking  over  Descartes’  ontological  position  Kant  made  an  essential
omission: he failed to provide an ontology of Dasein. This omission was a
decisive  one  in  the  spirit  [im  Sinne]  of  Descartes’  ownmost  tendencies.
With the ‘cogito sum’ Descartes had claimed that he was putting philosophy

on a new and firm footing. But what he left undetermined when he began in
this ‘radical’ way, was the kind of Being which belongs to the res cogitans,
or—more  precisely—the  meaning  of  the  Being  of  the  ‘s  u  m’.(1)  By
working  out  the  unexpressed  ontological  foundations  of  the  ‘cogito  sum’,
we  shall  complete  our  sojourn  at  the  second  station  along  the  path  of  our
destructive retrospect of the history of ontology. Our Interpretation will not
only prove that Descartes had to neglect the question of Being altogether; it
will  also  show  why  he  came  to  suppose  that  the  absolute  ‘Being-certain’
[“Gewisssein”) of the cogito exempted him from raising the question of the
meaning of the Being which this entity possesses.
 

1. We follow the later editions in reading ‘der Seinssinn des “sum” ’. The earlier editions have an

anacoluthic ‘den’ for ‘der’.

H. 25

 

Yet  Descartes  not  only  continued  to  neglect  this  and  thus  to  accept  a
completely indefinite ontological status for the res cogitans sive mens sive
animus  [‘the  thing  which  cognizes,  whether  it  be  a  mind  or  spirit’]:  he
regarded  this  entity  as  a  fundamentum  inconcussum,  and  applied  the
medieval ontology to it in carrying through the fundamental considerations
of  his  Meditationes.  He  defined  the  res  cogitans  ontologically  as  an  ens;
and  in  the  medieval  ontology  the  meaning  of  Being  for  such  an  ens  had
been  fixed  by  understanding  it  as  an  ens  creatum.  God,  as  ens  infinitum,
was the ens  i n c r e a t u m. But createdness [Geschaffenheit) in the widest
sense  of  something’s  having  been  produced  [Hergestelltheit],  was  an
essential  item  in  the  structure  of  the  ancient  conception  of  Being.  The
seemingly new beginning which Descartes proposed for philosophizing has
revealed  itself  as  the  implantation  of  a  baleful  prejudice,  which  has  kept
later  generations  from  making  any  thematic  ontological  analytic  of  the
‘mind’ [“Gemütes”] such as would take the question of Being as a clue and
would at the same time come to grips critically with the traditional ancient
ontology.

Everyone who is acquainted with the middle ages sees that Descartes is
‘dependent’ upon medieval scholasticism and employs its terminology. But
with  this  ‘discovery’  nothing  is  achieved  philosophically  as  long  as  it
remains  obscure  to  what  a  profound  extent  the  medieval  ontology  has

influenced the way in which posterity has determined or failed to determine
the ontological character of the res cogitans. The full extent of this cannot
be  estimated  until  both  the  meaning  and  the  limitations  of  the  ancient
ontology have been exhibited in terms of an orientation directed towards the
question  of  Being.  In  other  words,  in  our  process  of  destruction  we  find
ourselves  faced  with  the  task  of  Interpreting  the  basis  of  the  ancient
ontology in the light of the problematic of Temporality. When this is done,
it will be manifest that the ancient way of interpreting the Being of entities
is oriented towards the ‘world’ or ‘Nature’ in the widest sense, and that it is
indeed  in  terms  of  ‘time’  that  its  understanding  of  Being  is  obtained.  The
outward evidence for this (though of course it is merely outward evidence)
is  the  treatment  of  the  meaning  of  Being  as  παρουσία  or  ουσία,  which
signifies,  in  ontologico-Temporal  terms,  ‘presence’  [“Anwesenheit”].(1)
Entities  are  grasped  in  their  Being  as  ‘presence’;  this  means  that  they  are
understood with regard to a definite mode of time—the ‘Present’.(2)

The problematic of Greek ontology, like that of any other, must take its
clues from Dasein itself. In both ordinary and philosophical usage, Dasein,
man’s  Being,  is  ‘defined’  as  the  ζώον  λόγον  έχον—as  that  living  thing
whose Being is essentially determined by the potentiality for discourse.(3)
λέγειν is the clue for arriving at those structures of Being which belong to
the  entities  we  encounter  in  addressing  ourselves  to  anything  or  speaking
about  it  [im  Ansprechen  und  Besprechen].  (Cf.  Section  7  B.)  This  is  why
the  ancient  ontology  as  developed  by  Plato  turns  into  ‘dialectic’.  As  the
the
ontological  clue  gets  progressively  worked  out—namely, 
‘hermeneutic’ of the λόγον—it  becomes  increasingly  possible  to  grasp  the
problem of Being in a more radical fashion. The ‘dialectic’, which has been
a genuine philosophical embarrassment, becomes superfluous.
 

in 

1. The noun ουσία is derived from one of the stems used in conjugating the irregular verb είναι,
(‘to be’); in the Aristotelian tradition it is usually translated as ‘substance’, though translators of Plato
are  more  likely  to  write  ‘essence’,  ‘existence’,  or  ‘being’.  Heidegger  suggests  that  ουσία  is  to  be
thought of as synonymous with the derivative noun παρουσία (‘being-at’, ‘presence’). As he points
out,  παρουσία  has  a  close  etymological  correspondence  with  the  German  ‘Anwesenheit’,  which  is
similarly derived from the stem of a verb meaning ‘to be’ (Cf. O.H.G. ‘wesan’) and a prefix of the
place  or  time  at  which  (‘an-’).  We  shall  in  general  translate  ‘Anwesenheit’  as  ‘presence’,  and  the
participle ‘anwesend’ as some form of the expression ‘have presence’.

2. ‘die “Gegenwart” ’. While this noun may, like παρουσία or ‘Anwesenheit’, mean the presence
of someone at  some  place  or  on  some  occasion,  it  more  often  means  the  present,  as  distinguished
from the past and the future. In its etymological root-structure, however, it means a waiting-towards.

While Heidegger seems to think of all these meanings as somehow fused, we shall generally translate
this noun as ‘the Present’, reserving ‘in the present’ for the corresponding adjective ‘gegenwärtig’.

3. The phrase ζώον λόγον έχον is traditionally translated as ‘rational animal’, on the assumption
that λόγος refers to the faculty of reason. Heidegger, however, points out that λόγος is derived from
the same root as the verb λέγειν (‘to talk’, ‘to hold discourse’); he identifies this in turn with νοεῖν
(‘to cognize’, ‘to be aware of’, ‘to know’), and calls attention to the fact that the same stem is found
in  the  adjective  διαλεκτικός  (‘dialectical’).  (See  also  H.  165  below.)  He  thus  interprets  λόγος  as
‘Rede’,  which  we  shall  usually  translate  as  ‘discourse’  or  ‘talk’,  depending  on  the  context.  See
Section 7 B below (H. 32 ff.) and Sections 34 and 35, where ‘Rede’ will be defined and distinguished
both from ‘Sprache’ (‘language’) and from ‘Gerede’ (‘idle talk’) (H. 160 ff.).

H. 26

 

That is why Aristotle ‘no longer has any understanding’ of it, for he has
put it on a more radical footing and raised it to a new level [aufhob]. λέγειν
itself—or rather νοεῖν, that simple awareness of something present-at-hand
in  its  sheer  presence-at-hand,(1)  which  Parmenides  had  already  taken  to
guide him in his own interpretation of Being—has the Temporal structure of
a  pure  ‘making-present’  of  something.(2)  Those  entities  which  show
themselves in this and  f o r  it, and which are understood as entities in the
most authentic sense, thus get interpreted with regard to the Present; that is,
they are conceived as presence (οὐσία).(3)

Yet the Greeks have managed to interpret Being in this way without any
explicit  knowledge  of  the  clues  which  function  here,  without  any
acquaintance with the fundamental ontological function of time or even any
understanding  of  it,  and  without  any  insight  into  the  reason  why  this
function  is  possible.  On  the  contrary,  they  take  time  itself  as  one  entity
among other entities, and try to grasp it in the structure of its Being, though
that way of understanding Being which they have taken as their horizon is
one which is itself naïvely and inexplicitly oriented towards time.

Within the framework in which we are about to work out the principles
of  the  question  of  Being,  we  cannot  present  a  detailed  Temporal
Interpretation of the foundations of ancient ontology, particularly not of its
loftiest and purest scientific stage, which is reached in Aristotle. Instead we
shall  give  an  interpretation  of  Aristotle’s  essay  on  time,(ii)  which  may  be
chosen as providing a way of discriminating the basis and the limitations of
the ancient science of Being.

Aristotle’s  essay  on  time  is  the  first  detailed  Interpretation  of  this
phenomenon  which  has  come  down  to  us.  Every  subsequent  account  of
time, including Bergson’s, has been essentially determined by it. When we

analyse the Aristotelian conception, it will likewise become clear, as we go
back, that the Kantian account of time operates within the structures which
Aristotle has set forth; this means that Kant’s basic ontological orientation
remains that of the Greeks, in spite of all the distinctions which arise in a
new inquiry.

The  question  of  Being  does  not  achieve  its  true  concreteness  until  we
have carried through the process of destroying the ontological tradition. In
this way we can fully prove that the question of the meaning of Being is one
that we cannot avoid, and we can demonstrate what it means to talk about
‘restating’ this question.

In  any  investigation  in  this  field,  where  ‘the  thing  itself  is  deeply
veiled’(iii) one must take pains not to overestimate the results. For in such
an inquiry one is constantly compelled to face the possibility of disclosing
an  even  more  primordial  and  more  universal  horizon  from  which  we  may
draw  the  answer to  the  question,  “What is ‘Being’?”  We  can  discuss  such
possibilities seriously and with positive results only if the question of Being
has been reawakened and we have arrived at a field where we can come to
terms with it in a way that can be controlled.

1. ‘…von etwas Vorhandenem in seiner puren Vorhandenheit...’ The adjective ‘vorhanden’ means
literally  ‘before  the  hand’,  but  this  signification  has  long  since  given  way  to  others.  In  ordinary
German usage it may, for instance, be applied to the stock of goods which a dealer has ‘on hand’, or
to the ‘extant’ works of an author; and in earlier philosophical writing it could be used, like the word
‘Dasein’  itself,  as  a  synonym  for  the  Latin  ‘existentia’.  Heidegger,  however,  distinguishes  quite
sharply  between  ‘Dasein’ and  ‘Vorhandenheit’,  using  the latter to designate a kind of Being which
belongs  to  things  other  than  Dasein.  We  shall  translate  ‘vorhanden’  as  ‘present-at-hand’,  and
‘Vorhandenheit’ as ‘presence-at-hand’. The reader must be careful not to confuse these expressions
with  our  ‘presence’  (‘Anwesenheit’)  and  ‘the  Present’  (‘die  Gegenwart’),  etc.,  or  with  a  few  other
verbs and adjectives which we may find it convenient to translate by ‘present’.

2. ‘…des reinen “Gegenwärtigens” von etwas’. The verb ‘gegenwärtigen’, which is derived from
the  adjective  ‘gegenwärtig’,  is  not  a  normal  German  verb,  but  was  used  by  Husserl  and  is  used
extensively by Heidegger. While we shall translate it by various forms of ‘make present’, it does not
necessarily  mean  ‘making  physically  present’,  but  often  means  something  like  ‘bringing  vividly  to
mind’.

3. ‘Das Seiende, das sich in ihm für es zeigt und das als das eigentliche Seiende verstanden wird,
erhält demnach seine Auslegung in Rücksicht auf—Gegen-wart, d.h. es ist als Anwesenheit (οὐσία)
begriffen.’  The  hyphenation  of  ‘Gegen-wart’  calls  attention  to  the  structure  of  this  word  in  a  way
which  cannot  be  reproduced  in  English.  See  note  2,  H.  25  above.  The  pronouns  ‘ihm’  and  ‘es’
presumably both refer back to λέγειν, though their reference is ambiguous, as our version suggests.

7. The Phenomenological Method of Investigation

 

 

H. 27

In  provisionally  characterizing  the  object  which  serves  as  the  theme  of
our investigation (the Being of entities, or the meaning of Being in general),
it seems that we have also delineated the method to be employed. The task
of ontology is to explain Being itself and to make the Being of entities stand
out in full relief. And the method of ontology remains questionable in the
highest  degree  as  long  as  we  merely  consult  those  ontologies  which  have
come  down  to  us  historically,  or  other  essays  of  that  character.  Since  the
term  “ontology”  is  used  in  this  investigation  in  a  sense  which  is  formally
broad, any attempt to clarify the method of ontology by tracing its history is
automatically ruled out.

When, moreover, we use the term “ontology”, we are not talking about
some definite philosophical discipline standing in interconnection with the
others. Here one does not have to measure up to the tasks of some discipline
that  has  been  presented  beforehand;  on  the  contrary,  only  in  terms  of  the
objective necessities of definite questions and the kind of treatment which
the ‘things themselves’ require, can one develop such a discipline.

With the question of the meaning of Being, our investigation comes up
against  the  fundamental  question  of  philosophy.  This  is  one  that  must  be
treated  phenomenologically.  Thus  our  treatise  does  not  subscribe  to  a
‘standpoint’  or  represent  any  special  ‘direction’;  for  phenomenology  is
nothing of either sort, nor can it become so as long as it understands itself.
The  expression  ‘phenomenology’  signifies  primarily  a  methodological
conception. This expression does not characterize the  w h a t  of the objects
of  philosophical  research  as  subject-matter,  but  rather  the  how  of  that
research. The more genuinely a methodological concept is worked out and
the more comprehensively it determines the principles on which a science is
to be conducted, all the more primordially is it rooted in the way we come
to  terms  with  the  things themselves,(1) and the  farther  is  it removed from
what we call “technical devices”, though there are many such devices even
in the theoretical disciplines.
 

1. The appeal to the ‘Sachen selbst’, which Heidegger presents as virtually a slogan for Husserl’s
phenomenology, is not easy to translate without giving misleading impressions. What Husserl has in
mind  is  the  ‘things’  that  words  may  be  found  to  signify  when  their  significations  are  correctly

intuited by the right kind of Anschauung. (Cf. his  Logische Untersuchungen, vol.  2,  part  1,  second
edition, Halle, 1913, p. 6.) We have followed Marvin Farber in adopting ‘the things themselves’. (Cf.
his The Foundation of Phenomenology, Cambridge, Mass., 1943, pp. 202-3.) The word ‘Sache’ will,
of course, be translated in other ways also.

H. 28

 

Thus  the  term  ‘phenomenology’  expresses  a  maxim  which  can  be
formulated as ‘To the things themselves!’ It is opposed to all free-floating
constructions  and  accidental  findings;  it  is  opposed  to  taking  over  any
conceptions  which  only  seem  to  have  been  demonstrated;  it  is  opposed  to
those  pseudo-questions  which  parade  themselves  as  ‘problems’,  often  for
generations  at  a  time.  Yet  this  maxim,  one  may  rejoin,  is  abundantly  self-
evident,  and  it  expresses,  moreover,  the  underlying  principle  of  any
scientific  knowledge  whatsoever.  Why  should  anything  so  self-evident  be
taken up explicitly in giving a title to a branch of research? In point of fact,
the  issue  here  is  a  kind  of  ‘self-evidence’  which  we  should  like  to  bring
closer  to  us,  so  far  as  it  is  important  to  do  so  in  casting  light  upon  the
procedure of our treatise. We shall expound only the preliminary conception
[Vorbegriff] of phenomenology.

This expression has two components: “phenomenon” and “logos”. Both
of  these  go  back  to  terms  from  the  Greek:  φαινόμενον  and  λόγος.  Taken
superficially,  the  term  “phenomenology”  is  formed  like  “theology”,
“biology”,  “sociology”—names  which  may  be  translated  as  “science  of
life”,  “science  of  society”.  This  would  make
God”,  “science  of 
phenomenology  the  science  of  phenomena.  We  shall  set  forth  the
preliminary conception  of phenomenology  by characterizing what one has
in mind in the term’s two components, ‘phenomenon’ and ‘logos’, and by
establishing the meaning of the name in which these are put together.  The
history of the word itself, which presumably arose in the Wolffian school, is
here of no significance.

A. The Concept of Phenomenon

 

 

H. 29

The Greek expression φαινόμενον, to which the term ‘phenomenon’ goes
back, is derived from the verb φαίνεσθαι, which signifies  “to  show  itself”.
Thus φαινόμενον means that which shows itself, the manifest [das, was sich
zeigt, das Sichzeigende, das Offenbare]. φαίνεσθαι itself is a middle-voiced
form which comes from φαίνω—to bring  to  the  light  of day,  to  put  in  the
light. Φαίνω comes from  the  stem φα—,  like φῶς,  the  light,  that which is
bright—in  other  words,  that  wherein  something  can  become  manifest,
visible  in  itself.  Thus  we  must  keep  in  mind  that  the  expression
‘phenomenon’  signifies  that  which  shows  itself  in  itself,  the  manifest.
Accordingly the φαινόμενα or ‘phenomena’  are  the  totality of what lies  in
the light of day or can be brought to the light—what the Greeks sometimes
identified simply with τὰ ὄντα (entities). Now an entity can show itself  f r o
m  itself [von ihm selbst her] in many ways, depending in each case on the
kind of access we have to it. Indeed it is even possible for an entity to show
itself as something which in itself it is not. When it shows itself in this way,
it  ‘looks  like  something  or  other’  [“sieht”...  “so  aus  wie...”]. This  kind  of
showing-itself is what we call “seeming” [Scheinen]. Thus in Greek too the
expression  φαινόμενον  (“phenomenon”)  signifies  that  which  looks  like
something,  that  which  is  ‘semblant’,  ‘semblance’  [das  “Scheinbare”,  der
“Schein”]. Φαινόμενον ἀγαθόν means something good which looks like, but
‘in  actuality’  is  not,  what  it  gives  itself  out  to  be.  If  we  are  to  have  any
further  understanding  of  the  concept  of  phenomenon,  everything  depends
on our seeing how what is designated in the first signification of φαινόμενον
(‘phenomenon’  as  that  which  shows  itself)  and  what  is  designated  in  the
second (‘phenomenon’ as semblance) are structurally interconnected. Only
when  the  meaning  of  something  is  such  that  it  makes  a  pretension  of
showing  itself—that  is,  of  being  a  phenomenon—can  it  show  itself  as
something  which  it  is  not;  only  then  can  it  ‘merely  look  like  so-and-so’.
When  φαινόμενον  signifies  ‘semblance’,  the  primordial  signification  (the
phenomenon  as  the  manifest)  is  already  included  as  that  upon  which  the
second  signification  is  founded.  We  shall  allot  the  term  ‘phenomenon’  to
this  positive  and  primordial  signification  of  φαινόμενον,  and  distinguish
“phenomenon”  from  “semblance”,  which  is  the  privative  modification  of
“phenomenon”  as  thus  defined.  But  what  both  these  terms  express  has
proximally nothing at all to do with what is called an ‘appearance’, or still
less a ‘mere appearance’.(1)
 

1.  ‘…was  man  “Erscheinung”  oder  gar  “blosse  Erscheinung”  nennt.’  Though  the  noun
‘Erscheinung’ and the verb ‘erscheinen’ behave so much like the English ‘appearance’ and ‘appear’
that  the  ensuing  discussion  presents  relatively  few  difficulties  in  this  respect  for  the  translator,  the
passage shows some signs of hasty construction, and a few comments may be helpful. We are told
several  times  that  ‘appearance’  and  ‘phenomenon’  are  to  be  sharply  distinguished;  yet  we  are  also
reminded  that  there  is  a  sense  in  which  they  coincide,  and  even  this  sense  seems  to  be  twofold,
though it is not clear that Heidegger is fully aware of this. The whole discussion is based upon two
further  distinctions:  the  distinction  between  ‘showing’  (‘zeigen’)  and  ‘announcing’  (‘melden’)  and
‘bringing  forth’  (‘hervorbringen’),  and  the  distinction  between  (‘x’)  that  which  ‘shows  itself’  (‘das
Sichzeigende’) or which ‘does the announcing’ (‘das Meldende’) or which ‘gets brought forth’ (‘das
Hervorgebrachte’), and  (‘y’)  that  which  ‘announces  itself’  (‘das  Sichmeldende’)  or  which  does  the
bringing-forth.  Heidegger  is  thus  able  to  introduce  the  following  senses  of  ‘Erscheinung’  or
‘appearance’:

1a. an observable event y, such as a symptom which announces a disease x by showing itself, and

in or through which x announces itself without showing itself;

1b. y’s showing-itself;
2. x’s announcing-itself in or through y;
3a. the ‘mere appearance’ y which x may bring forth when x is of such a kind that its real nature

can never be made manifest;

3b.  the  ‘mere  appearance’  which  is  the  bringing-forth  of  a  ‘mere  appearance’  in  sense  3a.
Heidegger makes abundantly clear that sense 2 is the proper sense of ‘appearance’ and that senses 3a
and  3b  are  the  proper  senses  of  ‘mere  appearance’.  On  H.  30  and  31  he  concedes  that  sense  1b
corresponds to the primordial sense of ‘phenomenon’; but his discussion on H. 28 suggests that 1a
corresponds to this more accurately, and he reverts to this position towards the end of H. 30.

This is what one is talking about when one speaks of the ‘symptoms of a
disease’  [“Krankheitserscheinungen”].  Here  one  has  in  mind  certain
occurrences  in  the  body  which  show  themselves  and  which,  in  showing
themselves    a  s    thus  showing  themselves,  ‘indicate’  [“indizieren”]
something which does not show  itself. The  emergence [Auftreten]  of such
occurrences,  their  showing-themselves,  goes  together  with  the  Being-
present-at-hand  of  disturbances  which  do  not  show  themselves.  Thus
appearance,  as  the  appearance  ‘of  something’,  does  not  mean  showing-
itself; it means rather the announcing-itself by [von] something which does
not show itself, but which announces itself through something which does
show itself. Appearing is a not-showing-itself. But the ‘not’ we find here is
by  no  means  to  be  confused  with  the  privative  “not”  which  we  used  in
defining the structure of semblance.(1) What appears does not show  itself;
and  anything  which  thus  fails  to  show  itself,  is  also  something  which  can
never  s  e  e  m.(2)  All  indications,  presentations,  symptoms,  and  symbols
have  this  basic  formal  structure  of  appearing,  even  though  they  differ
among themselves.
 

1. ‘…als welches es die Struktur des Scheins bestimmt.’ (The older editions omit the ‘es’.)

2.  ‘Was  sich  in  der  Weise  nicht  zeigt,  wie  das  Erscheinende,  kann  auch  nie  scheinen.’  This
passage is ambiguous, but presumably ‘das Erscheinende’ is to be interpreted as the x, not our y. The
reader  should  notice  that  our  standardized  translation  of  ‘scheinen’  as  ‘seem’  is  one  which  here
becomes  rather  misleading,  even  though  these  words  correspond  fairly  well  in  ordinary  usage.  In
distinguishing between ‘scheinen’ and ‘erscheinen’, Heidegger seems to be insisting that ‘scheinen’
can  be  done  only  by  the  y  which  ‘shows  itself’  or  ‘does  the  announcing’,  not  by  the  x  which
‘announces itself’ in or through y, even though German usage does not differentiate these verbs quite
so sharply.

H. 30

 

In spite of the fact that ‘appearing’ is never a showing-itself in the sense
of “phenomenon”, appearing is possible only by reason of a showing-itself
of  something.  But  this  showing-itself,  which  helps  to  make  possible  the
appearing,  is  not  the  appearing  itself.  Appearing  is  an  announcing-itself
[das Sich-melden] through something that shows itself. If one then says that
with  the  word  ‘appearance’  we  allude  to  something  wherein  something
appears without being itself an appearance, one has not thereby defined the
concept of phenomenon: one has rather presupposed it. This presupposition,
however,  remains  concealed;  for  when  one  says  this  sort  of  thing  about
‘appearance’, the expression ‘appear’ gets used in two ways. “That wherein
something ‘appears’ ” means that wherein something announces itself, and
therefore does not show itself; and in the words [Rede] ‘without being itself
an  “appearance”  ’,  “appearance”  signifies  the  showing-itself.  But  this
showing-itself  belongs  essentially  to  the  ‘wherein’  in  which  something
announces  itself.  According  to  this,  phenomena  are  never  appearances,
though on the other hand every appearance is dependent on phenomena. If
one  defines  “phenomenon”  with  the  aid  of  a  conception  of  ‘appearance’
which is still unclear, then everything is stood on its head, and a ‘critique’
of phenomenology on this basis is surely a remarkable undertaking.

So  again  the  expression  ‘appearance’  itself  can  have  a  double
signification:  first,  appearing,  in  the  sense  of  announcing-itself,  as  not-
showing-itself;  and  next,  that  which  does  the  announcing  [das  Meldende
selbst]—that which in its showing-itself indicates something which does not
show itself. And finally one can use “appearing” as a term for the genuine
sense  of  “phenomenon”  as  showing-itself.  If  one  designates  these  three
different things as ‘appearance’, bewilderment is unavoidable.

But  this  bewilderment  is  essentially  increased  by  the  fact  that
‘appearance’  can  take  on  still  another  signification.  That  which  does  the

announcing—that  which,  in  its  showing-itself,  indicates  something  non-
manifest—may  be  taken  as  that  which  emerges  in  what  is  itself  non-
manifest, and which emanates [ausstrahlt] from it in such a way indeed that
the  non-manifest  gets  thought  of  as  something  that  is  essentially  never
manifest.  When  that  which  does  the  announcing  is  taken  this  way,
“appearance”  is  tantamount  to  a  “bringing  forth”  or  “something  brought
forth”, but something which does not make up the real Being of what brings
it forth: here we have an appearance in the sense of ‘mere appearance’. That
which does the announcing and is brought forth does, of course, show itself,
and in such a way that, as an emanation of what it announces, it keeps this
very  thing  constantly  veiled  in  itself.  On  the  other  hand,  this  not-showing
which  veils  is  not  a  semblance.  Kant  uses  the  term  “appearance”  in  this
twofold  way.  According  to  him  “appearances”  are,  in  the  first  place,  the
‘objects of empirical intuition’: they are what shows itself in such intuition.
But  what  thus  shows  itself  (the  “phenomenon”  in  the  genuine  primordial
sense)  is  at  the  same  time  an  ‘appearance’  as  an  emanation  of  something
which hides itself in that appearance—an emanation which announces.

H. 31

 

In  so  far  as  a  phenomenon  is  constitutive  for  ‘appearance’  in  the
signification  of  announcing  itself  through  something  which  shows  itself,
though  such  a  phenomenon  can  privatively  take  the  variant  form  of
semblance,  appearance  too  can  become  mere  semblance.  In  a  certain  kind
of lighting someone can look as if his cheeks were flushed with red; and the
redness which shows itself can be taken as an announcement of the Being-
present-at-hand of a fever, which in turn indicates some disturbance in the
organism.

“Phenomenon”, the showing-itself-in-itself; signifies a distinctive way in
which something can be encountered.(1) “Appearance”, on the other hand,
means a reference-relationship which  i s  in an entity itself,(2) and which is
such that what does the referring (or the announcing) can fulfil its possible
function  only  if  it  shows  itself  in  itself  and  is  thus  a  ‘phenomenon’.  Both
appearance  and  semblance  are  founded  upon  the  phenomenon,  though  in
different ways. The bewildering multiplicity of ‘phenomena’ designated by
the words “phenomenon”, “semblance”, “appearance”, “mere appearance”,

cannot be disentangled unless the concept of the phenomenon is understood
from the beginning as that which shows itself in itself.
 

1. ‘…eine ausgezeichnete Begegnisart von etwas.’ The noun ‘Begegnis’ is derived from the verb

‘begegnen’, which is discussed in note 2, H. 44 below.

2. ‘…einen seienden Verweisungsbezug im Seienden selbst...’ The verb ‘verweisen’, which we
shall  translate  as  ‘refer’  or  ‘assign’,  depending  upon  the  context,  will  receive  further  attention  in
Section 17 below. See also our note 2, H. 68 below.

If in taking the concept of “phenomenon” this way, we leave indefinite
which entities we consider as “phenomena”, and leave it open whether what
shows itself is an entity or rather some characteristic which an entity may
have in its Being, then we have merely arrived at the formal conception of
“phenomenon”. If by “that which shows itself” we understand those entities
which are accessible through the empirical “intuition” in, let us say, Kant’s
sense,  then  the  formal  conception  of  “phenomenon”  will  indeed  be
legitimately employed. In this usage “phenomenon” has the signification of
the ordinary conception of phenomenon. But this ordinary conception is not
the  phenomenological  conception.  If  we  keep  within  the  horizon  of  the
Kantian  problematic,  we  can  give  an  illustration  of  what  is  conceived
phenomenologically  as  a  “phenomenon”,  with  reservations  as  to  other
differences; for we may then say that that which already shows itself in the
appearance  as  prior  to  the  “phenomenon”  as  ordinarily  understood  and  as
accompanying  it  in  every  case,  can,  even  though  it  thus  shows  itself
unthematically, be brought thematically to show itself; and what thus shows
itself  in  itself  (the  ‘forms  of  the  intuition’)  will  be  the  “phenomena”  of
phenomenology.  For  manifestly  space  and  time  must  be  able  to  show
themselves in this way—they must be able to become phenomena—if Kant
is claiming to make a transcendental assertion grounded in the facts when
he says that space is the a priori “inside-which” of an ordering.(1)

If,  however,  the  phenomenological  conception  of  phenomenon  is  to  be
understood  at  all,  regardless  of  how  much  closer  we  may  come  to
determining  the  nature  of  that  which  shows  itself;  this  presupposes
inevitably  that  we  must  have  an  insight  into  the  meaning  of  the  formal
conception  of  phenomenon  and  its  legitimate  employment  in  an  ordinary
signification.—But  before  setting  up  our  preliminary  conception  of
phenomenology,  we  must  also  define  the  signification  of  λόγος  so  as  to

make clear in what sense phenomenology can be a ‘science of’ phenomena
at all.

B. The Concept of the  L o g o s

 

 

H. 32

In  Plato  and  Aristotle  the  concept  of  the  λόγος  has  many  competing
significations, with no basic signification positively taking the lead. In fact,
however, this is only a semblance, which will maintain itself as long as our
Interpretation  is  unable  to  grasp  the  basic  signification  properly  in  its
primary  content.  If  we  say  that  the  basic  signification  of  λόγος  is
“discourse”,(2)  then  this  word-for-word  translation  will  not  be  validated
until  we  have  determined  what  is  meant  by  “discourse”  itself.  The  real
signification  of  “discourse”,  which  is  obvious  enough,  gets  constantly
covered  up  by  the  later  history  of  the  word  λόγος,  and  especially  by  the
numerous  and  arbitrary  Interpretations  which  subsequent  philosophy  has
provided. Λόγος gets  ‘translated’  (and  this  means  that  it  is  always  getting
interpreted) as “reason”, “judgment”, “concept”, “definition”, “ground”, or
“relationship”.(3) But how can ‘discourse’ be so susceptible of modification
that λόγος  can  signify  all  the  things  we  have  listed,  and  in  good  scholarly
usage?  Even  if  λόγος  is  understood  in  the  sense  of  “assertion”,  but  of
“assertion”  as  ‘judgment’,  this  seemingly  legitimate  translation  may  still
miss the fundamental signification, especially if “judgment” is conceived in
a  sense  taken  over  from  some  contemporary  ‘theory  of  judgment’.  Λόγος
does not mean “judgment”, and it certainly does not mean this primarily—if
one  understands  by  ‘judgment”  a  way  of  ‘binding’  something  with
something  else,  or  the  ‘taking  of  a  stand’  (whether  by  acceptance  or  by
rejection).
 

1. Cf. Critique of Pure Reason(2), ‘Transcendental Aesthetic’, Section 1, p. 34.
2. On λόγος, ‘Rede’, etc., see note 3, H. 25 above.
3. ‘...Vernunft, Urteil, Begriff, Definition, Grund, Verhältnis.’

Λόγος as “discourse” means rather the same as δηλοῦν: to make manifest
what  one  is  ‘talking  about’  in  one’s  discourse.(1)  Aristotle  has  explicated
this  function  of  discourse  more  precisely  as  ἀποφαίνεσθαι.(iv)  The  λόγος

lets  something  be  seen  (φαίνεσθαι),  namely,  what  the  discourse  is  about;
and it does so either for the one who is doing the talking (the medium) or
for persons who are talking with one another, as the case may be. Discourse
‘lets  something  be  seen’  ἀπο…: that  is,  it  lets  us  see  something  from  the
very thing which the discourse is about.(2) In discourse (ἀποφανσις), so far
as it is genuine, what is said [was geredet ist] is drawn from what the talk is
about,  so  that  discursive  communication,  in  what  it  says  [in  ihrem
Gesagten],  makes  manifest  what  it  is  talking  about,  and  thus  makes  this
accessible to the other party. This is the structure of the λόγος as ἀποφανσις.
This mode of making manifest in the sense of letting something be seen by
pointing it out, does not go with all kinds of ‘discourse’. Requesting (εὐχή),
for instance, also makes manifest, but in a different way.
 

iv. Cf. Aristotle, De Interpretatione 1—6; also Metaphysica Z 4, and Ethica Nicomachea Z.

1. ‘…offenbar machen das, wovon in der Rede “die Rede” ist.’
2. ‘…von dem selbst her, wovon die Rede ist.’

 

 

H. 33

When  fully  concrete,  discoursing  (letting  something  be  seen)  has  the
character of speaking [Sprechens]—vocal proclamation in words. The λόγος
is  φωνή,  and  indeed,  φωνή  μετὰ  φαντασίας—an  utterance  in  which
something is sighted in each case.

And only because the function of the λόγος as ἀποφανσις lies  in  letting
something be seen by pointing it out, can the λόγος have the structural form
of σύνθεσις. Here “synthesis” does not mean a binding and linking together
of  representations,  a  manipulation  of  psychical  occurrences  where  the
‘problem’  arises  of  how  these  bindings,  as  something  inside,  agree  with
something  physical  outside.  Here  the  σύν  has  a  purely  apophantical
signification  and  means  letting  something  be  seen  in  its  togetherness
[Beisammen] with something—letting it be seen as something.

Furthermore,  because  the  λόγος  is  a  letting-something-be-seen,  it  can
therefore be true or false. But here everything depends on our steering clear
of any conception of truth which is construed in the sense of ‘agreement’.
This  idea  is  by  no  means  the  primary  one  in  the  concept  of  ἀλήθεια.  The
‘Being-true’ of the λόγος as ἀλήθεύειν means that in λέγειν as ἀποφαίνεσθαι
the  entities of  which one  is  talking  must  be  taken  out  of  their  hiddenness;

one  must  let  them  be  seen  as  something  unhidden  (ἀληθές);  that  is,  they
must  be  discovered.(1)  Similarly,  ‘Being  false’  (ψεύδεσαι)  amounts  to
deceiving  in  the  sense  of  covering  up  [verdecken]:  putting  something  in
front of something (in such a way as to let it be seen) and thereby passing it
off as something which it is not.

But because ‘truth’ has this meaning, and because the λόγος is a definite
mode  of  letting  something  be  seen,  the  λόγος  is  just not the  kind  of  thing
that  can  be  considered  as  the  primary  ‘locus’  of  truth.  If,  as  has  become
quite  customary  nowadays,  one  defines  “truth”  as  something  that  ‘really’
pertains  to  judgment,(2)  and  if  one  then  invokes  the  support  of  Aristotle
with  this  thesis,  not  only  is  this  unjustified,  but,  above  all,  the  Greek
conception  of  truth  has  been  misunderstood.  Αἴσθησις,  the  sheer  sensory
perception  of  something,  is  ‘true’  in  the  Greek  sense,  and  indeed  more
primordially than the λόγος which we have been discussing. Just as seeing
aims  at  colours,  any  αἴσθησις  aims  at  its  ἴδια  (those  entities  which  are
genuinely  accessible  only  through  it  and  for  it);  and  to  that  extent  this
perception is always true. This means that seeing always discovers colours,
and  hearing  always  discovers  sounds.  Pure  νοεῖν  is  the  perception  of  the
simplest determinate ways of Being which entities as such may possess, and
it perceives them just by looking at them.(3) This νοεῖν is what is ‘true’ in
the purest and most primordial sense; that is to say, it merely discovers, and
it  does  so  in  such  a  way  that  it  can  never  cover  up.  This  νοεῖν  can  never
cover  up;  it  can  never  be  false;  it  can  at  worst  remain  a  non-perceiving,
άγνοεῖν, not sufficing for straightforward and appropriate access.

When  something  no  longer  takes  the  form  of  just  letting  something  be
seen,  but  is  always  harking  back  to  something  else  to  which  it  points,  so
that  it  lets  something  be  seen  as  something,  it  thus  acquires  a  synthesis-
structure, and with this it takes over the possibility of covering up.(4) The
‘truth of judgments’, however, is merely the opposite of this covering-up, a
secondary phenomenon of truth, with more than one kind of foundation.(5)
Both  realism  and  idealism  have—with  equal  thoroughness—missed  the
meaning  of  the  Greek  conception  of  truth,  in  terms  of  which  only  the
possibility  of  something  like  a  ‘doctrine  of  ideas’  can  be  understood  as
philosophical knowledge.

 

solchen.’

1. The Greek words for ‘truth’ (ἡ ἀλήθεια, τὸ ἀληθές are compounded of the privative prefix ἀ-
(‘not’) and the verbal stem -λαθ- (‘to escape notice’, ‘to be concealed’). The truth may thus be looked
upon as that which is un-concealed, that which gets discovered or uncovered (‘entdeckt’).
2. ‘Wenn man... Wahrheit als das bestimmt, was “eigentlich” dem Urteil zukommt...’
3.  ‘…das schlicht hinsehende Vernehmen der einfachsten Seinsbestimmungen  des Seienden als

4. ‘Was nicht mehr die Vollzugsform des reinen Sehenlassens hat, sondern je im Aufweisen auf
ein  anderes  rekurriert  und  so  je  etwas  als  etwas  sehen  lässt,  das  übernimmt  mit  dieser
Synthesisstruktur die Möglichkeit des Verdeckens.’

5.  ‘…ein  mehrfach  fundiertes  Phänomen  von  Wahrheit.’  A  ‘secondary’  or  ‘founded’
phenomenon  is  one  which  is  based  upon  something  else.  The  notion  of  ‘Fundierung’  is  one  which
Heidegger has taken over from Husserl. See our note 1, on H. 59 below.

And  because  the  function  of  the  λόγος  lies  in  merely  letting  something
be seen, in letting entities be perceived [im Vernehmenlassen des Seienden],
λόγος  can  signify  the  reason [Vernunft]. And  because,  moreover,  λόγος  is
used not only with the signification of λέγειν but also with that of λεγόμενον
(that which is exhibited, as such), and because the latter is nothing else than
the ὐποκείμενον which, as present-at-hand, already lies at the bottom [zum
Grunde] of any procedure of addressing oneself to it or discussing it, λόγος
qua λεγόμενον  means  the  ground,  the  ratio.  And  finally,  because  λόγος  as
λεγόμενον can also signify that which, as something to which one addresses
oneself,  becomes  visible  in  its  relation  to  something  in  its  ‘relatedness’,
λόγος acquires the signification of relation and relationship.(1)

This Interpretation of ‘apophantical discourse’ may suffice to clarify the

primary function of the λόγος.
 

1. Heidegger is here pointing out that the word λόγος is etymologically akin to the verb λέγειν,
which  has  among  its  numerous  meanings  those  of  laying  out,  exhibiting,  setting  forth,  recounting,
telling a tale, making a statement. Thus λόγος as λέγειν can be thought of as the faculty of ‘reason’
(‘Vernunft’) which makes such activities possible. But λόγος can also mean τὸ λεγόμενον (that which
is laid out, exhibited, set forth, told); in this sense it is the underlying subject matter (τὸ ὺποκείμενον)
to which one addresses oneself and which one discusses (‘Ansprechen und Besprechen’); as such it
lies ‘at the bottom’ (‘zum Grunde’) of what is exhibited or told, and is thus the ‘ground’ or ‘reason’
(‘Grund’) for telling it. But when something is exhibited or told, it is exhibited in its relatedness (‘in
seiner Bezogenheit’); and in this way λόγος as λεγόμενον comes to stand for just such a relation or
relationship  (‘Beziehung  und  Verhältnis’).  The  three  senses  here  distinguished  correspond  to  three
senses of the Latin ‘ratio’, by which λόγος was traditionally translated, though Heidegger explicitly
calls  attention  to  only  one  of  these.  Notice  that  ‘Beziehung’  (which  we  translate  as  ‘relation’)  can
also  be  used  in  some  contexts  where  ‘Ansprechen’  (our  ‘addressing  oneself’)  would  be  equally
appropriate.  Notice  further  that  ‘Verhältnis’  (our  ‘relationship’),  which  is  ordinarily  a  synonym  for
‘Beziehung’, can, like λόγος and ‘ratio’, also refer to the special kind of relationship which one finds
in  a  mathematical  proportion.  The  etymological  connection  between  ‘Vernehmen’  and  ‘Vernunft’
should also be noted.

C. The Preliminary Conception of Phenomenology

When  we  envisage  concretely  what  we  have  set  forth  in  our
Interpretation  of  ‘phenomenon’  and  ‘logos’,  we  are  struck  by  an  inner
relationship  between  the  things  meant  by  these  terms.  The  expression
“phenomenology”  may  be  formulated  in  Greek  as  λέγειν  τὰ  φαινόμενα,
where  λέγειν  means  ἀποφαίνεσθαι.  Thus  “phenomenology”  means
ἀποφαίνεσθαι  τὰ  φαινόμενα—to  let  that  which  shows  itself  be  seen  from
itself in the very way in which it shows itself from itself. This is the formal
meaning of that branch of research which calls itself “phenomenology”. But
here we are expressing nothing else than the maxim formulated above: ‘To
the things themselves!’

 

 

H. 35

the 

time 

ihrer 

Thus  the  term  “phenomenology”  is  quite  different  in  its  meaning  from
expressions  such  as  “theology”  and  the  like.  Those  terms  designate  the
objects  of  their  respective  sciences  according  to  the  subject-matter  which
they  comprise  at 
jeweiligen  Sachhaltigkeit].
[in 
‘Phenomenology’  neither  designates  the  object  of  its  researches,  nor
characterizes the subject-matter thus comprised. The word merely informs
us  of  the  “how”  with  which  what  is  to  be  treated  in  this  science  gets
exhibited and handled. To have a science ‘of’ phenomena means to grasp its
objects in such a way that everything about them which is up for discussion
must  be  treated  by  exhibiting  it  directly  and  demonstrating  it  directly.(1)
The  expression  ‘descriptive  phenomenology’,  which 
is  at  bottom
tautological,  has  the  same  meaning.  Here  “description”  does  not  signify
such a procedure as we find, let us say, in botanical morphology; the term
has  rather  the  sense  of  a  prohibition—the  avoidance  of  characterizing
anything  without  such  demonstration.  The  character  of  this  description
itself,  the  specific  meaning  of  the  λόγος,  can  be  established  first  of  all  in
terms of the ‘thinghood’ [“Sachheit”] of what is to be ‘described’—that is
to  say,  of  what  is  to  be  given  scientific  definiteness  as  we  encounter  it
phenomenally.  The  signification  of  “phenomenon”,  as  conceived  both
formally and in the ordinary manner, is such that any exhibiting of an entity
as  it  shows  itself  in  itself,  may  be  called  “phenomenology”  with  formal
justification.

 

1. ‘…in direkter Aufweisung und direkter Ausweisung...’

Now  what  must  be  taken  into  account  if  the  formal  conception  of
phenomenon is to be deformalized into the phenomenological one, and how
is  this  latter  to  be  distinguished  from  the  ordinary  conception?  What  is  it
that  phenomenology  is  to  ‘let  us  see’?  What  is  it  that  must  be  called  a
‘phenomenon’ in a distinctive sense? What is it that by its very essence is
necessarily 
theme  whenever  we  exhibit  something  explicitly?
Manifestly,  it  is  something  that  proximally  and  for  the  most  part  does  not
show itself at all: it is something that lies hidden, in contrast to that which
proximally and for the most part does show itself; but at the same time it is
something  that  belongs  to  what  thus  shows  itself,  and  it  belongs  to  it  so
essentially as to constitute its meaning and its ground.

the 

Yet that which remains hidden in an egregious sense, or which relapses
and gets covered up again, or which shows  itself only ‘in  disguise’, is  not
just  this  entity  or  that,  but  rather  the  Being  of  entities,  as  our  previous
observations have shown. This Being can be covered up so extensively that
it  becomes  forgotten  and  no  question  arises  about  it  or  about  its  meaning.
Thus  that  which  demands  that  it  become  a  phenomenon,  and  which
demands this in a distinctive sense and in terms of its ownmost content as a
thing,  is  what  phenomenology  has  taken  into  its  grasp  thematically  as  its
object.

Phenomenology  is  our  way  of  access  to  what  is  to  be  the  theme  of
ontology,  and  it  is  our  way  of  giving  it  demonstrative  precision.  Only  as
phenomenology, is  ontology possible.  In the  phenomenological conception
of  “phenomenon”  what  one  has  in  mind  as  that  which  shows  itself  is  the
Being of entities, its meaning, its modifications and derivatives.(1) And this
showing-itself  is  not  just  any  showing-itself,  nor  is  it  some  such  thing  as
appearing. Least of all can the Being of entities ever be anything such that
‘behind it’ stands something else ‘which does not appear’.

H. 36

 

‘Behind’ the phenomena of phenomenology there is essentially nothing
else;  on  the  other  hand,  what  is  to  become  a  phenomenon  can  be  hidden.
And just because the phenomena are proximally and for the most part not

given,  there  is  need  for  phenomenology.  Covered-up-ness  is  the  counter-
concept to ‘phenomenon’.

There are various ways in which phenomena can be covered up. In the
first place, a phenomenon can be covered up in the sense that it is still quite
undiscovered.  It 
is  neither  known  nor  unknown.(2)  Moreover,  a
phenomenon  can  be  buried  over  [verschüttet].  This  means  that  it  has  at
some  time  been  discovered  but  has  deteriorated  [verfiel]  to  the  point  of
getting covered up again. This covering-up can become complete; or rather
—and  as  a  rule—what  has  been  discovered  earlier  may  still  be  visible,
though only as a semblance. Yet so much semblance, so much ‘Being’.(3)
This  covering-up  as  a  ‘disguising’  is  both  the  most  frequent  and  the  most
dangerous,  for  here  the  possibilities  of  deceiving  and  misleading  are
especially stubborn. Within a ‘system’, perhaps, those structures of Being—
and their concepts—which are still available but veiled in their indigenous
character, may claim their rights. For when they have been bound together
constructively  in  a  system,  they  present  themselves  as  something  ‘clear’,
requiring  no  further  justification,  and  thus  can  serve  as  the  point  of
departure for a process of deduction.

1.  ‘Der  phänomenologische  Begriff  von  Phänomen  meint  als  das  Sichzeigende  das  Sein  des

Seienden, seinen Sinn, seine Modifikationen und Derivate.’

2.  ‘Über  seinen  Bestand  gibt  es  weder  Kenntnis  noch  Unkenntnis.’  The  earlier  editions  have
‘Erkenntnis’  where  the  latter  ones  have  ‘Unkenntnis’.  The  word  ‘Bestand’  always  presents
difficulties  in  Heidegger;  here  it  permits  either  of  two  interpretations,  which  we  have  deliberately
steered  between:  ‘Whether  there  is  any  such  thing,  is  neither  known  nor  unknown’,  and  ‘What  it
comprises is something of which we have neither knowledge nor ignorance.’

3. ‘Wieviel Schein jedoch, soviel “Sein”.’

The covering-up itself, whether in the sense of hiddenness, burying-over,
or disguise, has in turn two possibilities. There are coverings-up which are
accidental; there are also some which are necessary, grounded in what the
thing  discovered  consists  in  [der  Bestandart  des  Entdeckten].  Whenever  a
phenomenological  concept  is  drawn  from  primordial  sources,  there  is  a
possibility  that  it  may  degenerate  if  communicated  in  the  form  of  an
assertion. It gets understood in an empty way and is thus passed on, losing
its  indigenous  character,  and  becoming  a  free-floating  thesis.  Even  in  the
concrete work of phenomenology itself there lurks the possibility that what
has been primordially ‘within our grasp’ may become hardened so that we

can  no  longer  grasp  it.  And  the  difficulty  of  this  kind  of  research  lies  in
making it self-critical in a positive sense.

H. 37

 

The way in which Being and its structures are encountered in the mode
of phenomenon is one which must first of all be wrested from the objects of
phenomenology.  Thus  the  very  point  of  departure  [Ausgang]  for  our
analysis  requires  that  it  be  secured  by  the  proper  method,  just  as  much  as
does our access [Zugang] to the phenomenon, or our passage [Durchgang]
through  whatever  is  prevalently  covering  it  up.  The  idea  of  grasping  and
explicating  phenomena  in  a  way  which  is  ‘original’  and  ‘intuitive’
[“originären”  und  “intuitiven”]  is  directly  opposed  to  the  naïveté  of  a
haphazard, ‘immediate’, and unreflective ‘beholding’. [“Schauen”].

Now 

that  we  have  delimited  our  preliminary  conception  of
phenomenology, the terms ‘phenomenal’  and  ‘phenomenological’ can  also
be fixed in their signification. That which is given and explicable in the way
the  phenomenon  is  encountered  is  called  ‘phenomenal’;  this  is  what  we
have  in  mind  when  we  talk  about  “phenomenal  structures”.  Everything
which belongs to the species of exhibiting and explicating and which goes
to  make  up  the  way  of  conceiving  demanded  by  this  research,  is  called
‘phenomenological’.

Because  phenomena,  as  understood  phenomenologically,  are  never
anything but what goes to make up Being, while Being is in every case the
Being of some entity, we must first bring forward the entities themselves if
it is our aim that Being should be laid bare; and we must do this in the right
way. These entities must likewise show themselves with the kind of access
which genuinely belongs to them. And in this way the ordinary conception
of phenomenon becomes phenomenologically relevant. If our analysis is to
be  authentic,  its  aim  is  such  that  the  prior  task  of  assuring  ourselves
‘phenomenologically’  of  that  entity  which  is  to  serve  as  our  example,  has
already been prescribed as our point of departure.

With  regard  to  its  subject-matter,  phenomenology  is  the  science  of  the
Being of entities—ontology. In explaining the tasks of ontology we found it
necessary that there should be a fundamental ontology taking as its theme
that  entity  which  is  ontologico-ontically  distinctive,  Dasein,  in  order  to
confront  the  cardinal  problem—the  question  of  the  meaning  of  Being  in

that 

investigation 

itself  will  show 

the  meaning  of
general.  Our 
phenomenological description as a method lies in interpretation. The λόγος
of the phenomenology of Dasein has the character of a ἐρμηνεύειν, through
which  the  authentic  meaning  of  Being,  and  also  those  basic  structures  of
Being  which  Dasein  itself  possesses,  are  made  known  to  Dasein’s
understanding of Being. The phenomenology of Dasein is a hermeneutic in
the  primordial  signification  of  this  word,  where  it  designates  this  business
of interpreting. But to the extent that by uncovering the meaning of Being
and the basic structures of Dasein in general we may exhibit the horizon for
any  further  ontological  study  of  those  entities  which  do  not  have  the
character of Dasein, this hermeneutic also becomes a ‘hermeneutic’ in the
sense  of  working  out  the  conditions  on  which  the  possibility  of  any
ontological investigation depends. And finally, to the extent that Dasein, as
an  entity  with  the  possibility  of  existence,  has  ontological  priority  over
every  other  entity,  “hermeneutic”,  as  an  interpretation  of  Dasein’s  Being,
has  the  third  and  specific  sense  of  an  analytic  of  the  existentiality  of
existence;  and  this  is  the  sense  which  is  philosophically  primary. Then  so
far as this hermeneutic works out Dasein’s historicality ontologically as the
ontical condition for the possibility of historiology, it contains the roots of
what  can  be  called  ‘hermeneutic’  only  in  a  derivative  sense:  the
methodology  of  those  humane  sciences  which  are  historiological  in
character.

H. 38

 

Being, as the basic theme of philosophy, is no class or genus of entities;
yet  it  pertains  to  every  entity.  Its  ‘universality’  is  to  be  sought  higher  up.
Being and the structure of Being lie beyond every entity and every possible
character which an entity may possess. Being is the  t r a n s c e n d e n s
 pure and simple.(1) And the transcendence of Dasein’s Being is distinctive
in  that  it  implies  the  possibility  and  the  necessity  of  the  most  radical
is
individuation.  Every  disclosure  of  Being  as 
transcendental  knowledge.  Phenomenological  truth  (the  disclosedness  of
Being) is  v e r i t a s  t r a n s c e n d e n t a l i s.

transcendens 

the 

Ontology  and  phenomenology  are  not  two  distinct  philosophical
disciplines  among  others.  These  terms  characterize  philosophy  itself  with
regard  to  its  object  and  its  way  of  treating  that  object.  Philosophy  is

universal  phenomenological  ontology,  and  takes  its  departure  from  the
hermeneutic of Dasein, which, as an analytic of existence, has made fast the
guiding-line for all philosophical inquiry at the point where it arises and to
which it returns.

The following investigation would not have been possible if the ground
had  not  been  prepared  by  Edmund  Husserl,  with  whose  Logische
Untersuchungen  phenomenology  first  emerged.  Our  comments  on  the
preliminary  conception  of  phenomenology  have  shown  that  what  is
essential  in  it  does  not  lie  in  its  actuality  as  a  philosophical  ‘movement’
[“Richtung”].  Higher  than  actuality  stands  possibility.  We  can  understand
phenomenology only by seizing upon it as a possibility.(v)
 

v. If the following investigation has taken any steps forward in disclosing the ‘things themselves’,
the author must first of all thank E. Husserl, who, by providing his own incisive personal guidance
and  by  freely  turning  over  his  unpublished  investigations,  familiarized  the  author  with  the  most
diverse areas of phenomenological research during his student years in Freiburg.
 

1.  ‘Sein  und  Seinsstruktur  liegen  über  jedes  Seiende  and  jede  mögliche  seiende  Bestimmtheit

eines Seienden hinaus. Sein ist das transcendens schlechthin.’

H. 39

 

With  regard  to  the  awkwardness  and  ‘inelegance’  of  expression  in  the
analyses  to  come,  we  may  remark  that  it  is  one  thing  to  give  a  report  in
which we tell about entities, but another to grasp entities in their Being. For
the  latter  task  we  lack  not  only  most  of  the  words  but,  above  all,  the
‘grammar’. If we may allude to some earlier researches on the analysis of
Being,  incomparable  on  their  own  level,  we  may  compare  the  ontological
sections of Plato’s Parmenides or the fourth chapter of the seventh book of
Aristotle’s Metaphysics with  a  narrative  section  from  Thucydides;  we  can
then see the altogether unprecedented character of those formulations which
were  imposed  upon  the  Greeks  by  their  philosophers.  And  where  our
powers are essentially weaker, and where moreover the area of Being to be
disclosed is ontologically far more difficult than that which was presented
to the Greeks, the harshness of our expression will be enhanced, and so will
the minuteness of detail with which our concepts are formed.

8. Design of the Treatise

 

The  question  of  the  meaning  of  Being  is  the  most  universal  and  the
emptiest of questions, but at the same time it is possible to individualize it
very  precisely  for  any  particular  Dasein.  If  we  are  to  arrive  at  the  basic
concept  of  ‘Being’  and  to  outline  the  ontological  conceptions  which  it
requires and the variations which it necessarily undergoes, we need a clue
which is concrete. We shall proceed towards the concept of Being by way
of  an  Interpretation  of  a  certain  special  entity,  Dasein,  in  which  we  shall
arrive at the horizon for the understanding of Being and for the possibility
of interpreting it; the universality of the concept of Being is not belied by
the  relatively  ‘special’  character  of  our  investigation.  But  this  very  entity,
Dasein, is in itself ‘historical’, so that its own-most ontological elucidation
necessarily becomes an ‘historiological’ Interpretation.

Accordingly  our  treatment  of  the  question  of  Being  branches  out  into

two distinct tasks, and our treatise will thus have two parts:

Part  One: the  Interpretation  of  Dasein  in  terms  of  temporality,  and  the

explication of time as the transcendental horizon for the question of Being.

Part  Two:  basic  features  of  a  phenomenological  destruction  of  the

history of ontology, with the problematic of Temporality as our clue.

Part One has three divisions:
1. the preparatory fundamental analysis of Dasein;
2. Dasein and temporality;
3. time and Being.(1)

H. 40

 

Part Two likewise has three divisions(1):
1. Kant’s  doctrine  of  schematism  and  time,  as  a  preliminary  stage  in  a

problematic of Temporality;

2.  the  ontological  foundation  of  Descartes’  ‘cogito  sum’,  and  how  the
medieval  ontology  has  been  taken  over  into  the  problematic  of  the  ‘res
cogitans’;

3. Aristotle’s essay on time, as providing a way of discriminating 

the phenomenal basis and the limits of ancient ontology.

 

1. Part Two and the third division of Part One have never appeared.

PART ONE: THE INTERPRETATION OF DASEIN IN TERMS
OF TEMPORALITY, AND THE EXPLICATION OF TIME AS THE
TRANSCENDENTAL HORIZON FOR THE QUESTION OF BEING
 

DIVISION ONE: PREPARATORY FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS

OF DASEIN

 

 

H. 41

IN  the  question  about  the  meaning  of  Being,  what  is  primarily
interrogated  is  those  entities  which  have  the  character  of  Dasein.  The
preparatory  existential  analytic  of  Dasein  must,  in  accordance  with  its
peculiar  character,  be  expounded  in  outline,  and  distinguished  from  other
kinds of investigation which seem to run parallel (Chapter 1). Adhering to
the procedure which we have fixed upon for starting our investigation, we
must  lay  bare  a  fundamental  structure  in  Dasein:  Being-in-the-world
(Chapter 2). In  the  interpretation  of  Dasein,  this  structure  is  something  ‘a
priori’; it is not pieced together, but is primordially and constantly a whole.
It  affords  us,  however,  various  ways  of  looking  at  the  items  which  are
constitutive for it. The whole of this structure always comes first; but if we
keep  this  constantly  in  view,  these  items,  as  phenomena,  will  be  made  to
stand  out.  And  thus  we  shall  have  as  objects  for  analysis:  the  world  in  its
worldhood (Chapter 3), Being-in-the-world as Being-with and Being-one’s-
Self  (Chapter  4),  and  Being-in  as  such  (Chapter  5).  By  analysis  of  this
fundamental structure, the Being of Dasein can be indicated provisionally.
Its existential meaning is care (Chapter 6).

I: EXPOSITION OF THE TASK OF A PREPARATORY

ANALYSIS OF DASEIN

 

 

 

H. 42

9. The Theme of the Analytic of Dasein

WE  are  ourselves  the  entities  to  be  analysed.  The  Being  of  any  such
entity  is  in  each  case  mine.(1)  These  entities,  in  their  Being,  comport
themselves  towards  their  Being.  As  entities  with  such  Being,  they  are
delivered  over  to  their  own  Being.(2)  Being  is  that  which  is  an  issue  for
every  such  entity.(3)  This  way  of  characterizing  Dasein  has  a  double
consequence:
 

1. ‘Das Seiende, dessen Analyse zur Aufgabe steht, sind wir je selbst. Das Sein dieses Seienden
ist  je  meines.’  The  reader  must  not  get  the  impression  that  there  is  anything  solipsistic  about  the
second of these sentences. The point is merely that the kind of Being which belongs to Dasein is of a
sort which any of us may call his own.

2. ‘Als Seiendes dieses Seins ist es seinem eigenen Sein überantwortet.’ The earlier editions read

‘...seinem eigenen Zu-sein...’
3. See note 2, H. 8 above.

1. The ‘essence’ [“Wesen”] of this entity lies in its “to be” [Zu-sein]. Its
Being-what-it-is [Was-sein] (essentia) must, so far as we can speak of it at
all, be conceived in terms of its Being (existentia). But here our ontological
task is to show that when we choose to designate the Being of this entity as
“existence” [Existenz], this term does not and cannot have the ontological
signification of the traditional term “existentia”; ontologically, existentia is
tantamount  of Being-present-at-hand,  a kind  of Being  which is  essentially
inappropriate to entities of Dasein’s character. To avoid getting bewildered,
we  shall  always  use  the  Interpretative  expression  “presence-at-hand”  for
the term “existentia”, while the term “existence”, as a designation of Being,
will be allotted solely to Dasein.

The  ‘essence’  of  Dasein  lies  in  its  existence.  Accordingly  those
characteristics  which  can  be  exhibited  in  this  entity  are  not  ‘properties’
present-at-hand of some entity which ‘looks’ so and so and is itself present-
at-hand; they are in each case possible ways for it to be, and no more than
that. All the Being-as-it-is [So-sein] which this entity possesses is primarily
Being.  So  when  we  designate  this  entity  with  the  term  ‘Dasein’,  we  are
expressing not its “what” (as if it were a table, house or tree) but its Being.

2. That Being which is an issue for this entity in its very Being, is in each
case mine. Thus Dasein is never to be taken ontologically as an instance or
special case of some genus of entities as things that are present-at-hand.(1)
To  entities  such  as  these,  their  Being  is  ‘a  matter  of  indifference’;(2)  or
more precisely, they  ‘are’ such that their  Being  can be neither  a matter of
indifference  to  them,  nor  the  opposite.  Because  Dasein  has  in  each  case
mineness [Jemeinigkeit], one must always use a personal pronoun when one
addresses it: ‘I am’, ‘you are’.

Furthermore,  in  each  case  Dasein  is  mine  to  be  in  one  way  or  another.
Dasein has always made some sort of decision as to the way in which it is
in each case mine [je meines]. That entity which in its Being has this very
Being  as  an  issue,  comports  itself  towards  its  Being  as  its  ownmost
possibility. In each case Dasein is its possibility, and it ‘has’ this possibility,
but  not  just  as  a  property  [eigenschaftlich],  as  something  present-at-hand
would. And because Dasein is in each case essentially its own possibility, it
can, in its very Being, ‘choose’ itself and win itself; it can also lose itself
and  never  win  itself;  or  only  ‘seem’  to  do  so.  But  only  in  so  far  as  it  is
essentially  something  which  can  be  authentic—that  is,  something  of  its
own(3)—can it have lost itself and not yet won itself. As modes of Being,
authenticity  and  inauthenticity  (these  expressions  have  been  chosen
terminologically  in  a  strict  sense)  are  both  grounded  in  the  fact  that  any
Dasein  whatsoever  is  characterized  by  mineness.(4)  But  the  inauthenticity
of Dasein does not signify any ‘less’ Being or any ‘lower’ degree of Being.
Rather  it  is  the  case  that  even  in  its  fullest  concretion  Dasein  can  be
characterized by inauthenticity—when busy, when excited, when interested,
when ready for joyment.
 

1.  ‘…als  Vorhandenem’.  The  earlier  editions  have  the  adjective  ‘vorhandenem’  instead  of  the

substantive.

2.  ‘gleichgültig’.  This  adjective  must  be  distinguished  from  the  German  adjective  ‘indifferent’,
though they might both ordinarily be translated by the English ‘indifferent’, which we shall reserve

exclusively  for  the  former.  In  most  passages,  the  latter  is  best  translated  by  ‘undifferentiated’  or
‘without  further  differentiation’;  occasionally,  however,  it  seems  preferable  to  translate  it  by
‘Indifferent’  with  an  initial  capital.  We  shall  follow  similar  conventions  with  the  nouns
‘Gleichgültigkeit’ and ‘Indifferenz’.

3. ‘Und weil Dasein wesenhaft je seine Möglichkeit ist, kann dieses Seiende in seinem Sein sich
selbst “wählen”, gewinnen, es kann sich verlieren, bzw. nie und nur “scheinbar” gewinnen. Verloren
haben kann es sich nur und noch nicht sich gewonnen haben kann es nur, sofern es seinem Wesen
nach  mögliches  eigentliches,  das  heisst  sich  zueigen  ist.’  Older  editions  have  ‘je  wesenhaft’  and
‘zueigenes’.  The  connection  between  ‘eigentlich’  (‘authentic’,  ‘real’)  and  ‘eigen’  (‘own’)  is  lost  in
translation.

4. ‘…dass Dasein überhaupt durch Jemeinigkeit bestimmt ist.’

H. 43

 

The two characteristics of Dasein which we have sketched—the priority
of ‘existentia’ over essentia, and the  fact that Dasein is  in  each case  mine
[die Jemeinigkeit]—have already indicated that in the analytic of this entity
we are facing a peculiar phenomenal domain. Dasein does not have the kind
of  Being  which  belongs  to  something  merely  present-at-hand  within  the
world, nor does it ever have it. So neither is it to be presented thematically
as something we come across in the same way as we come across what is
present-at-hand.  The  right  way  of  presenting  it  is  so  far  from  self-evident
that  to  determine  what  form  it  shall  take  is  itself  an  essential  part  of  the
ontological analytic of this entity. Only by presenting this entity in the right
way  can  we  have  any  understanding  of  its  Being.  No  matter  how
provisional  our  analysis  may  be,  it  always  requires  the  assurance  that  we
have started correctly.

In determining itself as an entity, Dasein always does so in the light of a
possibility  which  it  is  itself  and  which,  in  its  very  Being,  it  somehow
understands. This is the formal meaning of Dasein’s existential constitution.
But  this  tells  us  that  if  we  are  to  Interpret  this  entity  ontologically,  the
problematic  of  its  Being  must  be  developed  from  the  existentiality  of  its
existence. This cannot mean, however, that “Dasein” is to be construed in
terms  of  some  concrete  possible  idea  of  existence.  At  the  outset  of  our
analysis  it  is  particularly  important  that  Dasein  should  not  be  Interpreted
with  the  differentiated  character  [Differenz]  of  some  definite  way  of
existing, but that it should be uncovered [aufgedeckt] in the undifferentiated
character  which 
the  most  part.  This
undifferentiated  character  of  Dasein’s  everydayness  is  not  nothing,  but  a

it  has  proximally  and  for 

positive phenomenal characteristic of this entity. Out of this kind of Being
—and  back  into  it  again—is  all  existing,  such  as  it  is.(1)  We  call  this
everyday 
“averageness”
character 
[Durchschnittlichkeit].

undifferentiated 

of  Dasein 

H. 44

 

And  because  this  average  everydayness  makes  up  what  is  ontically
proximal  for  this  entity,  it  has  again  and  again  been  passed  over  in
explicating  Dasein.  That  which  is  ontically  closest  and  well  known,  is
ontologically  the  farthest  and  not  known  at  all;  and  its  ontological
signification is constantly overlooked. When Augustine asks: “Quid  autem
propinquius  meipso  mihi?”  and  must  answer:  “ego  certe  laboro  hic  et
laboro  in  meipso:  factus  sum  mihi  terra  difficultatis  et  sudoris  nimii”,(i)
this  applies  not  only  to  the  ontical  and  pre-ontological  opaqueness  of
Dasein but even more to the ontological task which lies ahead; for not only
must  this  entity  not  be  missed  in  that  kind  of  Being  in  which  it  is
phenomenally  closest,  but  it  must  be  made  accessible  by  a  positive
characterization.

Dasein’s  average  everydayness,  however,  is  not  to  be  taken  as  a  mere
‘aspect’. Here too, and even in the mode of inauthenticity, the structure of
existentiality lies a priori. And here too Dasein’s Being is an issue for it in a
definite way; and Dasein comports itself towards it in the mode of average
everydayness, even if this is only the mode of fleeing in the face of it and
forgetfulness thereof.(2)
 

i. St. Augustine, Confessiones, X, 16. [‘But what is closer to me than myself? Assuredly I labour
here and I labour within myself; I have become to myself a land of trouble and inordinate sweat.’—
Tr.]
 

1. ‘Aus dieser Seinsart heraus und in sie zurück ist alles Existieren, wie es ist.’
2. ‘Auch in ihr geht es dem Dasein in bestimmter Weise um sein Sein, zu dem es sich im Modus
der durchschnittlichen Alltäglichkeit verhält und sei es auch nur im Modus der Flucht davor und des
Vergessens seiner.’ For further discussion, see Section 40 below.

But the explication of Dasein in its average everydayness does not give
us  just  average  structures  in  the  sense  of  a  hazy  indefiniteness.  Anything
which,  taken  ontically,  is  in  an  average  way,  can  be  very  well  grasped
structurally
ontologically 

structures  which  may  be 

in  pregnant 

indistinguishable  from  certain  ontological  characteristics  [Bestimmungen]
of an authentic Being of Dasein.

H. 45

 

All explicata to which the analytic of Dasein gives rise are obtained by
considering  Dasein’s  existence-structure.  Because  Dasein’s  characters  of
Being are defined in terms of existentiality, we call them “e x i s t e n t i a l i
a”. These are to be sharply distinguished from what we call “categories”—
characteristics of Being for entities whose character is not that of Dasein.(1)
Here  we  are  taking  the  expression  “category”  in  its  primary  ontological
signification, and abiding by it. In the ontology of the ancients, the entities
we  encounter  within  the  world(2)  are  taken  as  the  basic  examples  for  the
interpretation of Being. Νοεῖν (or the λόγος, as the case may be) is accepted
as  a  way  of  access  to  them.(3)  Entities  are  encountered  therein.  But  the
Being  of  these  entities  must  be  something  which  can  be  grasped  in  a
distinctive  kind  of  λέγειν  (letting  something  be  seen),  so  that  this  Being
becomes intelligible in advance as that which it is—and as that which it is
already  in  every  entity.  In  any  discussion  (λόγος)  of  entities,  we  have
previously  addressed ourselves to  Being; this addressing is κατηγορεῖσθαι.
(4) This  signifies,  in  the  first  instance,  making  a  public  accusation,  taking
someone  to  task  for  something  in  the  presence  of  everyone.  When  used
ontologically,  this  term  means  taking  an  entity  to  task,  as  it  were,  for
whatever  it  is  as  an  entity—that  is  to  say,  letting  everyone  see  it  in  its
Being.  The  κατηγορίαι  are  what  is  sighted  and  what  is  visible  in  such  a
seeing.(5)  They  include  the  various  ways  in  which  the  nature  of  those
entities which can be addressed and discussed in a λόγος may be determined
a  priori.  Existentialia  and  categories  are  the  two  basic  possibilities  for
characters of Being. The entities which correspond to them require different
kinds  of  primary  interrogation  respectively:  any  entity  is  either  a  “who”
(existence)  or  a  “what”  (presence-at-hand  in  the  broadest  sense).  The
connection between these two modes of the characters of Being cannot be
handled until the horizon for the question of Being has been clarified.
 

1. ‘Weil sie sich aus der Existenzialität bestimmen, nennen wir die Seinscharaktere des Daseins
Existenzialien.  Sie  sind  scharf  zu  trennen  von  den  Seinsbestimmungen  des  nicht  daseinsmässigen
Seienden, die wir Kategorien nennen.’

2.  ‘…das  innerhalb  der  Welt  begegnende  Seiende.’  More  literally:  ‘the  entity  that  encounters
within  the  world.’  While  Heidegger  normally  uses  the  verb  ‘begegnen’  in  this  active  intransitive
sense, a similar construction with the English ‘encounter’ is unidiomatic and harsh. We shall as a rule
use either a passive construction (as in ‘entities encountered’) or an active transitive construction (as
in ‘entities we encounter’).

3.  ‘Als  Zugangsart  zu  ihm  gilt  das  νοεῖν  bzw.  der  λόγος.’  Here  we  follow  the  reading  of  the
earlier  editions.  In  the  later  editions,  ‘Zugangsart’,  which  is  used  rather  often,  is  here  replaced  by
‘Zugangsort’,  which  occurs  very  seldom  and  is  perhaps  a  misprint.  This  later  version  might  be
translated as follows: ‘νοεῖν (or the λόγος, as the case may be) is accepted as the locus of access to
such entities.’ On νοεῖν and λόγος see Section 7 above, especially H. 32-34.

4. ‘Das je schon vorgängige Ansprechen des Seins im Besprechen (λόγος) des  Seienden  ist  das

κατηγορεῖσθαι.’

5. ‘Das in solchem Sehen Gesichtete und Sichtbare...’ On ‘Sehen’ and ‘Sicht’ see H. 147.

In  our  introduction  we  have  already  intimated  that  in  the  existential
analytic of Dasein we also make headway with a task which is hardly less
pressing  than  that  of  the  question  of  Being  itself—the  task  of  laying  bare
that a priori basis which must be visible before the question of ‘what man
is’  can  be  discussed  philosophically.  The  existential  analytic  of  Dasein
comes  before  any  psychology  or  anthropology,  and  certainly  before  any
biology. While these too are ways in which Dasein can be investigated, we
can define the theme of our analytic with greater precision if we distinguish
it from these. And at the same time the necessity of that analytic can thus be
proved more incisively.

10.  How  the  Analytic  of  Dasein  is  to  be  Distinguished  from

Anthropology, Psychology, and Biology
 

After  a  theme  for  investigation  has  been  initially  outlined  in  positive
terms, it is always important to show what is to be ruled out, although it can
easily  become  fruitless  to  discuss  what  is  not  going  to  happen.  We  must
show that those investigations and formulations of the question which have
been  aimed  at  Dasein  heretofore,  have  missed  the  real  philosophical
problem (notwithstanding their objective fertility), and that as long as they
persist in missing it, they have no right to claim that they can accomplish
that  for  which  they  are  basically  striving.  In  distinguishing  the  existential
analytic  from  anthropology,  psychology,  and  biology,  we  shall  confine
ourselves  to  what  is  in  principle  the  ontological  question.  Our  distinctions
will  necessarily  be  inadequate  from  the  standpoint  of  ‘scientific  theory’

simply  because  the  scientific  structure  of  the  above-mentioned  disciplines
(not, indeed, the ‘scientific attitude’ of those who work to advance them) is
today thoroughly questionable and needs to be attacked in new ways which
must have their source in ontological problematics.

H. 46

 

Historiologically, the aim of the existential analytic can be made plainer
by  considering  Descartes,  who  is  credited  with  providing  the  point  of
departure for modern philosophical inquiry by his discovery of the “cogito
sum”.  He  investigates  the  “cogitare”  of  the  “ego”,  at  least  within  certain
limits. On the other hand, he leaves the “sum” completely undiscussed, even
though  it  is  regarded  as  no  less  primordial  that  the  cogito.  Our  analytic
raises  the  ontological  question  of  the  Being  of  the  “sum”.  Not  until  the
nature  of  this  Being  has  been  determined  can  we  grasp  the  kind  of  Being
which belongs to cogitationes.

the 

the  phenomenal  content 

At the same time it is of course misleading to exemplify the aim of our
analytic historiologically in this way. One of our first tasks will be to prove
that if we posit an “I” or subject as that which is proximally given, we shall
completely  miss 
[Bestand]  of  Dasein.
Ontologically,  every  idea  of  a  ‘subject’—unless  refined  by  a  previous
ontological  determination  of  its  basic  character—still  posits  the  subjectum
(ὐποκείμενον)  along  with  it,  no  matter  how  vigorous  one’s  ontical
‘reification  of
protestations  against 
consciousness’.  The  Thinghood  itself  which  such  reification  implies  must
have its ontological origin demonstrated if we are to be in a position to ask
what we are to understand positively when we think of the unreified Being
of the subject, the soul, the consciousness, the spirit, the person. All these
terms  refer  to  definite  phenomenal  domains  which  can  be  ‘given  form’
[“ausformbare”]: but they are never used without a notable failure to see the
need for inquiring about the Being of the entities thus designated. So we are
not  being  terminologically  arbitrary  when  we  avoid  these  terms—or  such
expressions as ‘life’ and ‘man’—in designating those entities which we are
ourselves.

‘soul  substance’  or 

the 

On  the  other  hand,  if  we  understand  it  rightly,  in  any  serious  and
scientifically-minded  ‘philosophy  of  life’  (this  expression  says  about  as
much as “the botany of plants”) there lies an unexpressed tendency towards

an  understanding  of  Dasein’s  Being.  What  is  conspicuous  in  such  a
philosophy (and here it is defective in principle) is that here ‘life’ itself as a
kind of Being does not become ontologically a problem.

H. 47

 

tendency 

in  every 

The  researches  of  Wilhelm  Dilthey  were  stimulated  by  the  perennial
question  of  ‘life’.  Starting  from  ‘life’  itself  as  a  whole,  he  tried  to
understand its ‘Experiences’(1) in their structural and developmental inter-
connections.  His  ‘geisteswissenschaftliche  Psychologie’  is  one  which  no
longer  seeks  to  be  oriented  towards  psychical  elements  and  atoms  or  to
piece the life of the soul together, but aims rather at ‘Gestalten’ and ‘life as
a whole’. Its philosophical relevance, however, is not to be sought here, but
rather in the fact that in all this he was, above all, on  his  way  towards  the
question of ‘life’. To be sure, we can also see here very plainly how limited
were both his problematic and the set of concepts with which it had to be
put into  words.  These  limitations,  however,  are  found  not  only  in  Dilthey
and  Bergson  but  in  all  the  ‘personalistic’  movements  to  which  they  have
given  direction  and 
towards  a  philosophical
anthropology.  The  phenomenological  Interpretation  of  personality  is  in
principle more radical and more transparent; but the question of the Being
of  Dasein  has  a  dimension  which  this  too  fails  to  enter.  No  matter  how
much  Husserl(ii)  and  Scheler  may  differ  in  their  respective  inquiries,  in
their  methods  of  conducting  them,  and  in  their  orientations  towards  the
world as a whole, they are fully in agreement on the negative side of their
Interpretations of personality. The question of ‘personal Being’ itself is one
which they no longer raise. We have chosen Scheler’s Interpretation as an
example,  not  only  because  it  is  accessible  in  print,(iii)  but  because  he
emphasizes  personal  Being  explicitly  as  such,  and  tries  to  determine  its
character by defining the specific Being of acts as contrasted with anything
‘psychical’. For Scheler, the person is never to be thought of as a Thing or a
substance;  the  person  ‘is  rather  the  unity  of  living-through  [Er-lebens]
which  is  immediately  experienced  in  and  with  our  Experiences—not  a
Thing  merely  thought  of  behind  and  outside  what  is  immediately
Experienced’.(iv)  The  person  is  no  Thinglike  and  substantial  Being.  Nor
can the Being of a person be entirely absorbed in being a subject of rational
acts which follow certain laws.

 

 

 

ii. Edmund Husserl’s investigations of the ‘personality’ have not as yet been published. The basic
orientation of his problematic is apparent as early as his paper ‘Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft’,
Logos, vol. I, 1910, p. 319. His investigation was carried much further in the second part of his Ideen
zu einer reinen Phänomenologie  und  phänomenologischen  Philosophie (Husserliana  IV),  of  which
the first part (Cf. this Jahrbuch [Jahrbuch für Philosophie und phänomenologische Forschung—Tr.]
vol.  I,  1913),  presents  the  problematic  of  ‘pure  consciousness’  as  the  basis  for  studying  the
Constitution of any Reality whatsoever. His detailed Constitutional analyses are to be found in three
sections of the second part, where he treats: 1. the Constitution of material Nature; 2. the Constitution
of  animal  Nature;  3.  the  Constitution  of  the  spiritual  world  (the  personalistic  point  of  view  as
opposed to the naturalistic). Husserl begins with the words: ‘Although Dilthey grasped the problems
which point the way, and saw the directions which the work to be done would have to take, he still
failed to penetrate to any decisive formulations of these problems, or to any solutions of them which
are  methodologically  correct.’  Husserl  has  studied  these  problems  still  more  deeply  since  this  first
treatment of them; essential portions of his work have been communicated in his Freiburg lectures.

iii. This Jahrbuch, vol. 1, 2, 1913, and II, 1916; cf. especially pp. 242 ff.
iv. Ibid., II, p. 243.

1. ‘Die “Erlebnisse” dieses “Lebens”...’ The connection between ‘Leben’ (‘life’) and ‘Erlebnisse’
(‘Experiences’) is lost in translation. An ‘Erlebnis’ is not just any ‘experience’ (‘Erfahrung’) but one
which we feel deeply and ‘live through’. We shall translate ‘Erlebnis’ and ‘erleben’ by ‘Experience’
with a capital ‘E’, reserving ‘experience’ for ‘Erfahrung’ and ‘erfahren’.

H. 48

The person is not a Thing, not a substance, not an object. Here Scheler is
emphasizing what Husserl(v) suggests when he insists that the unity of the
person must have a Constitution essentially different from that required for
the  unity  of  Things  of  Nature.(1)  What  Scheler  says  of  the  person,  he
applies to acts as well: ‘But an act is never also an object; for it is essential
to  the  Being  of  acts  that  they  are  Experienced  only  in  their  performance
itself  and  given  in  reflection.”(vi)  Acts  are  something  non-psychical.
Essentially the person exists only in the performance of intentional acts, and
is therefore essentially not an object. Any psychical Objectification of acts,
and hence any way of taking them as something psychical, is tantamount to
depersonalization.  A  person  is  in  any  case  given  as  a  performer  of
intentional acts which are bound together by the unity of a meaning. Thus
psychical Being has nothing to do with personal Being. Acts get performed;
the person is a performer of acts. What, however, is the ontological meaning
of ‘performance’? How is the kind of Being which belongs to a person to be
ascertained ontologically in a positive way? But the critical question cannot
stop  here.  It  must  face  the  Being  of  the  whole  man,  who  is  customarily

taken as a unity of body, soul, and spirit. In their turn “body”, “soul”, and
“spirit”  may  designate  phenomenal  domains  which  can  be  detached  as
themes  for  definite  investigations;  within  certain  limits  their  ontological
indefiniteness may not be important.

1. ‘…wenn er für die Einheit der Person eine wesentlich andere Konstitution fordert als für die

der Naturdinge.’ The second ‘der’ appears in the later editions only.

When,  however,  we  come  to  the  question  of  man’s  Being,  this  is  not
something  we  can  simply  compute(1)  by  adding  together  those  kinds  of
Being  which  body,  soul,  and  spirit  respectively  possess—kinds  of  Being
whose  nature  has  not  as  yet  been  determined.  And  even  if  we  should
attempt such an ontological procedure, some idea of the Being of the whole
must be presupposed. But what stands in the way of the basic question of
Dasein’s  Being  (or  leads  it  off  the  track)  is  an  orientation  thoroughly
coloured by the anthropology of Christianity and the ancient world, whose
inadequate  ontological  foundations  have  been  overlooked  both  by  the
philosophy of life and by personalism. There are two important elements in
this traditional anthropology:
 

1. Reading ‘errechnet’. The earliest editions have ‘verrechnet’, with the correct reading provided

in a list of errata.

1. ‘Man’ is here defined as a ζῷον λόγον ἔχον, and this is Interpreted to
mean an animal rationale, something living which has reason. But the kind
of Being which belongs to a ζῷον  is  understood in  the  sense  of occurring
and  Being-present-at-hand.  The  λόγος  is  some  superior  endowment;  the
kind of Being which belongs to it, however, remains quite as obscure as that
of the entire entity thus compounded.

H. 49

 

2.  The  second  clue  for  determining  the  nature  of  man’s  Being  and
essence  is  a  theological  one:  καὶ  εἶπεν  ὁ  Θεός·  ποιήσωμεν  ἄνθρωπον
κατ᾿  εἰκόνα  ἡμετέραν  καὶ  καθ᾿  ὁμοίωσιν—“faciamus  hominem  ad

imaginem nostram et similitudinem”.(vii) With this as its point of departure,
the anthropology of Christian theology, taking with it the ancient definition,
arrives at an interpretation of that entity which we call “man”. But just as
the  Being  of  God  gets  Interpreted  ontologically  by  means  of  the  ancient
ontology,  so  does  the  Being  of  the  ens  finitum,  and  to  an  even  greater
extent.  In  modern  times  the  Christian  definition  has  been  deprived  of  its
theological  character.  But  the  idea  of  ‘transcendence’—that  man  is
something  that  reaches  beyond  himself—is  rooted  in  Christian  dogmatics,
which  can  hardly  be  said  to  have  made  an  ontological  problem  of  man’s
Being. The idea of transcendence, according to which man is more than a
mere  something  endowed  with  intelligence,  has  worked  itself  out  with
different variations. The following quotations will illustrate how these have
originated:  ‘His  praeclaris  dotibus  excelluit  prima  hominis  conditio,  ut
ratio,  intelligentia,  prudentia,  judicium  non  modo  ad  terrenae  vitae
gubernationem suppeterent, sed quibus  t r a n s c e n d e r e t   usque ad
Deum et aeternam felicitatem.’(viii) ‘Denn dass der mensch sin  u f s e h e n
  hat  uf  Gott  und  sin  wort,  zeigt  er  klarlich  an,  dass  er  nach  siner  natur
etwas Gott näher anerborn, etwas mee  n a c h s c h l ä g t, etwas  z u z u g s
z u  jm hat, das alles on zwyfel darus flüsst, dass er nach dem  b i l d n u s
 Gottes geschaffen ist’.(ix)

The two sources which are relevant for the traditional anthropology—the
Greek  definition  and  the  clue  which  theology  has  provided—indicate  that
over and above the attempt to determine the essence of ‘man’ as an entity,
the  question  of  his  Being  has  remained  forgotten,  and  that  this  Being  is
rather conceived as something obvious or ‘self-evident’ in the sense of the
Being-present-at-hand  of  other  created  Things.  These  two  clues  become
intertwined  in  the  anthropology  of  modern  times,  where  the  res  cogitans,
consciousness, and the interconnectedness of Experience serve as the point
of departure for methodical study. But since even the cogitationes are either
left ontologically undetermined, or get tacitly assumed as something ‘self-
evidently’  ‘given’  whose  ‘Being’  is  not  to  be  questioned,  the  decisive
ontological 
remain
undetermined.

This  is  no  less  true  of  ‘psychology’, whose  anthropological  tendencies
are  today  unmistakable.  Nor  can  we  compensate  for  the  absence  of
ontological  foundations  by  taking  anthropology  and  psychology  and
building them into the framework of a general biology. In the  order  which
any  possible  comprehension  and  interpretation  must  follow,  biology  as  a
‘science  of  life’  is  founded  upon  the  ontology  of  Dasein,  even  if  not
entirely.  Life,  in  its  own  right,  is  a  kind  of  Being;  but  essentially  it  is
accessible only in Dasein. The ontology of life is accomplished by way of a
privative Interpretation; it determines what must be the case if there can be
anything  like  mere-aliveness  [Nur-noch-leben].  Life  is  not  a  mere  Being-
present-at-hand,  nor  is  it  Dasein.  In  turn,  Dasein  is  never  to  be  defined
ontologically by regarding it as life (in an ontologically indefinite manner)
plus something else.

In suggesting that anthropology, psychology, and biology all fail to give
an unequivocal and ontologically adequate answer to the question about the
kind  of  Being which  belongs  to  those  entities  which  we  ourselves  are,  we
are not passing judgment on the positive work of these disciplines. We must
always bear in mind, however, that these ontological foundations can never
be disclosed by subsequent hypotheses derived from empirical material, but
that  they  are  always  ‘there’  already,  even  when  that  empirical  material
simply gets collected. If positive research fails to see these foundations and
holds  them  to  be  self-evident,  this  by  no  means  proves  that  they  are  not
basic or that they are not problematic in a more radical sense than any thesis
of positive science can ever be.(x)
 

x. But to disclose the a priori is not to make an ‘a-prioristic’ construction. Edmund Husserl has
not only enabled us to understand once more the meaning of any genuine philosophical empiricism;
he  has also  given us the necessary tools. ‘A-priorism’ is  the  method  of  every  scientific  philosophy
which understands itself. There is nothing constructivistic about it. But for this very reason a priori
research requires that the phenomenal basis be properly prepared. The horizon which is closest to us,
and which must be made ready for the analytic of Dasein, lies in its average everydayness.

Dasein.  The  Difficulties  of  Achieving  a  ‘Natural  Conception  of  the
World’

through 

The  Interpretation  of  Dasein  in  its  everydayness,  however,  is  not
identical with the describing of some primitive stage of Dasein with which
we  can  become  acquainted  empirically 
the  medium  of
anthropology:  Everydayness  does  not  coincide  with  primitiveness,  but  is
rather  a  mode  of  Dasein’s  Being,  even  when  that  Dasein  is  active  in  a
highly developed and differentiated culture—and precisely then. Moreover,
even  primitive  Dasein  has  possibilities  of  a  Being  which  is  not  of  the
everyday kind, and it has a specific everydayness of its own. To  orient  the
analysis of Dasein towards the ‘life of primitive peoples’ can have positive
significance  [Bedeutung]  as  a  method  because  ‘primitive  phenomena’  are
often  less  concealed  and  less  complicated  by  extensive  self-interpretation
on  the  part  of  the  Dasein  in  question.  Primitive  Dasein  often  speaks  to  us
more directly in terms of a primordial absorption in ‘phenomena’ (taken in
a  pre-phenomenological  sense).  A  way  of  conceiving  things  which  seems,
perhaps,  rather  clumsy  and  crude  from  our  standpoint,  can  be  positively
helpful in bringing out the ontological structures of phenomena in a genuine
way.

But  heretofore  our  information  about  primitives  has  been  provided  by
ethnology.  And  ethnology  operates  with  definite  preliminary  conceptions
and interpretations of human Dasein in general, even in first ‘receiving’ its
material,  and  in  sifting  it  and  working  it  up.  Whether  the  everyday
psychology  or  even  the  scientific  psychology  and  sociology  which  the
ethnologist brings with him can provide any scientific assurance that we can
have  proper  access  to  the  phenomena  we  are  studying,  and  can  interpret
them and transmit them in the right way, has not yet been established. Here
too  we  are  confronted  with  the  same  state  of  affairs  as  in  the  other
disciplines  we  have  discussed.  Ethnology  itself  already  presupposes  as  its
clue  an  inadequate  analytic  of  Dasein.  But  since  the  positive  sciences
neither ‘can’ nor should wait for the ontological labours of philosophy to be
done, the further course of research will not take the form of an ‘advance’

but will be accomplished by recapitulating what has already been ontically
discovered,  and  by  purifying  it  in  a  way  which  is  ontologically  more
transparent.(xi)
 

xi. Ernst Cassirer has recently made the Dasein of myth a theme for philosophical Interpretation.
(See his Philosophie der symbolischen Formen, vol. II, Das mythische Denken, 1925.) In this study,
clues of far-reaching importance are made available for ethnological research. From the standpoint of
philosophical problematics it remains an open question whether the foundations of this Interpretation
are  sufficiently  transparent—whether  in  particular  the  architectonics  and  the  general  systematic
content of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason can provide a possible design for such a task, or whether a
new and more primordial approach may not here be needed. That Cassirer himself sees the possibility
of such a task is shown by his note on pp. 16 ff., where he alludes to the phenomenological horizons
disclosed  by  Husserl.  In  a  discussion  between  the  author  and  Cassirer  on  the  occasion  of  a  lecture
before the Hamburg  section of the Kantgesellschaft in  December  1923  on  ‘Tasks  and  Pathways  of
Phenomenological  Research’,  it  was  already  apparent  that  we  agreed  in  demanding  an  existential
analytic such as was sketched in that lecture.

H. 52

 

No  matter  how  easy  it  may  be  to  show  how  ontological  problematics
differ  formally  from  ontical  research  there  are  still  difficulties  in  carrying
out an existential analytic, especially in making a start. This task includes a
desideratum  which  philosophy  has 
long  found  disturbing  but  has
continually refused to achieve: to work out the idea of a ‘natural conception
of  the  world’. The  rich  store  of  information  now  available  as  to  the  most
exotic and manifold cultures and forms of Dasein seems favourable to our
setting about this task in a fruitful way. But this is merely a semblance. At
bottom this plethora of information can seduce us into failing to recognize
the real problem. We shall not get a genuine knowledge of essences simply
by  the  syncretistic  activity  of  universal  comparison  and  classification.
Subjecting  the  manifold  to  tabulation  does  not  ensure  any  actual
understanding of what lies there before us as thus set in order. If an ordering
principle is genuine, it has its own content as a thing [Sachgehalt], which is
never to be found by means of such ordering, but is already presupposed in
it. So if one is to put various pictures of the world in order, one must have
an explicit idea of the world as such. And if the ‘world’ itself is something
constitutive  for  Dasein,  one  must  have  an  insight  into  Dasein’s  basic
structures in order to treat the world-phenomenon conceptually.

In this chapter we have characterized some things positively and taken a
negative  stand  with  regard  to  others;  in  both  cases  our  goal  has  been  to

promote  a  correct  understanding  of  the  tendency  which  underlies  the
following Interpretation and the kind of questions which it poses. Ontology
can contribute only indirectly towards advancing the positive disciplines as
we find them today. It has a goal of its own, if indeed, beyond the acquiring
of  information  about  entities,  the  question  of  Being  is  the  spur  for  all
scientific seeking.

II: BEING-IN-THE-WORLD IN GENERAL AS THE BASIC

STATE OF DASEIN

 

 

12.  A  Preliminary  Sketch  of  Being-in-the-World,  in  terms  of  an

Orientation towards Being-in as such
 

H. 53

IN  our  preparatory  discussions  (Section  9)  we  have  brought  out  some
characteristics  of  Being  which  will  provide  us  with  a  steady  light  for  our
further  investigation,  but  which  will  at  the  same  time  become  structurally
concrete  as  that  investigation  continues.  Dasein  is  an  entity  which,  in  its
very  Being,  comports  itself  understandingly  towards  that  Being.  In  saying
this,  we  are  calling  attention  to  the  formal  concept  of  existence.  Dasein
exists.  Furthermore,  Dasein  is  an  entity  which  in  each  case  I  myself  am.
Mineness belongs to any existent Dasein, and belongs to it as the condition
which makes authenticity  and inauthenticity possible.  In each case  Dasein
exists  in  one  or  the  other  of  these  two  modes,  or  else  it  is  modally
undifferentiated.(1)
 

1.  ‘Zum  existierenden  Dasein  gehört  die  Jemeinigkeit  als  Bedingung  der  Möglichkeit  von
Eigentlichkeit  und  Uneigentlichkeit.  Dasein  existiert  je  in  einem  dieser  Modi,  bzw.  in  der  modalen
Indifferenz ihrer.’

But  these  are  both  ways  in  which  Dasein’s  Being  takes  on  a  definite
character, and they must be seen and understood a priori as grounded upon
that  state  of  Being  which  we  have  called  “Being-in-the-world’.  An
interpretation  of  this  constitutive  state  is  needed  if  we  are  to  set  up  our
analytic of Dasein correctly.

The  compound  expression  ‘Being-in-the-world’  indicates  in  the  very
way  we  have  coined  it,  that  it  stands  for  a  unitary  phenomenon.  This
primary  datum  must  be  seen  as  a  whole.  But  while  Being-in-the-world

cannot be broken up into contents which may be pieced together, this does
not prevent it from having several constitutive items in its structure. Indeed
the phenomenal datum which our expression indicates is one which may, in
fact,  be  looked  at  in  three  ways.  If  we  study  it,  keeping  the  whole
phenomenon  firmly  in  mind  beforehand,  the  following  items  may  be
brought out for emphasis:

First,  the  ‘in-the-world’.  With  regard  to  this  there  arises  the  task  of
inquiring into the ontological structure of the ‘world’ and defining the idea
of worldhood as such. (See the third chapter of this Division.)

Second,  that  entity  which  in  every  case  has  Being-in-the-world  as  the
way in which it is. Here we are seeking that which one inquires into when
one asks the question ‘Who?’ By a phenomenological demonstration(1) we
shall determine who is in the mode of Dasein’s average everydayness. (See
the fourth chapter of this Division.)

Third,  Being-in  [In-sein]  as  such.  We  must  set  forth  the  ontological
Constitution  of  inhood  [Inheit]  itself.  (See  the  fifth  chapter  of  this
Division.). Emphasis upon any one of these constitutive items signifies that
the others are emphasized along with it; this means that in any such case the
whole  phenomenon  gets  seen.  Of  course  Being-in-the-world  is  a  state  of
Dasein(2)  which  is  necessary  a  priori,  but  it  is  far  from  sufficient  for
completely  determining  Dasein’s  Being.  Before  making  these  three
phenomena  the  themes  for  special  analyses,  we  shall  attempt  by  way  of
orientation to characterize the third of these factors.

H. 54

 

What is meant by “Being-in”? Our proximal reaction is to round out this
expression to “Being-in ‘in the world’ ”, and we are inclined to understand
this  Being-in  as  ‘Being  in  something’  [“Sein  in...”].  This  latter  term
designates the kind of Being which an entity has when it is ‘in’ another one,
as  the  water  is  ‘in’  the  glass,  or  the  garment  is  ‘in’  the  cupboard.  By  this
‘in’  we  mean  the  relationship  of  Being  which  two  entities  extended  ‘in’
space  have  to  each  other  with  regard  to  their  location  in  that  space.  Both

water  and  glass,  garment  and  cupboard,  are  ‘in’  space  and  ‘at’  a  location,
and both in the same way. This relationship of Being can be expanded: for
instance,  the  bench  is  in  the  lecture-room,  the  lecture-room  is  in  the
university, the university is in the city, and so on, until we can say that the
bench  is  ‘in  world-space’.  All  entities  whose  Being  ‘in’  one  another  can
thus  be  described  have  the  same  kind  of  Being—that  of  Being-present-at-
hand—as  Things  occurring  ‘within’  the  world.  Being-present-at-hand  ‘in’
something  which  is  likewise  present-at-hand,  and  Being-present-at-hand-
along-with  [Mitvorhandensein]  in  the  sense  of  a  definite  location-
relationship  with  something  else  which  has  the  same  kind  of  Being,  are
ontological  characteristics  which  we  call  “categorial”: they  are  of  such  a
sort as to belong to entities whose kind of Being is not of the character of
Dasein.

Being-in, on the other hand, is a state of Dasein’s Being; it is an  e x i s t
e n t i a l e. So one cannot think of it as the Being-present-at-hand of some
corporeal Thing (such as a human body) ‘in’ an entity which is present-at-
hand. Nor does the term “Being-in” mean a spatial ‘in-one-another-ness’ of
things present-at-hand, any more than the word ‘in’ primordially signifies a
spatial  relationship  of  this  kind.(i)  ‘In’  is  derived  from  “innan”—“to
reside”,(1)  “habitare”,  “to  dwell”  [sich  auf  halten].  ‘An’  signifies  “I  am
accustomed”,  “I  am  familiar  with”,  “I  look  after  something”.(2)  It  has  the
signification of “colo” in the senses of “habito” and “diligo”. The entity to
which  Being-in  in  this  signification  belongs  is  one  which  we  have
characterized  as  that  entity  which  in  each  case  I  myself  am  [bin].  The
expression ‘bin’ is connected with ‘bei’, and so ‘ich bin’ [‘I am’] means in
its turn “I reside” or “dwell alongside” the world, as that which is familiar
to me in such and such a way.(3) “Being” [Sein], as the definition of ‘ich
bin’  (that  is  to  say,  when  it  is  understood  as  an  existentiale), signifies  “to
reside alongside...”, “to  be familiar with...”. “Being-in”  is  thus  the  formal
existential  expression  for  the  Being  of  Dasein,  which  has  Being-in-the-
world as its essential state.

H. 55

 

‘Being  alongside’  the  world  in  the  sense  of  being  absorbed  in  the
world(4) (a sense which calls for still closer interpretation) is an existentiale
founded  upon  Being-in.  In  these  analyses  the  issue  is  one  of  seeing  a

primordial  structure  of  Dasein’s  Being—a  structure  in  accordance  with
whose  phenomenal  content  the  concepts  of  Being  must  be  Articulated;
because of this, and because this structure is in principle one which cannot
be grasped by the traditional ontological categories, this ‘Being-alongside’
must be examined still more closely. We shall again choose the method of
contrasting  it  with  a  relationship  of  Being  which  is  essentially  different
ontologically—viz. categorial—but which we express by the same linguistic
means.  Fundamental  ontological  distinctions  are  easily  obliterated;  and  if
they  are  to  be  envisaged  phenomenally  in  this  way,  this  must  be  done
explicitly,  even  at  the  risk  of  discussing  the  ‘obvious’.  The  status  of  the
ontological  analytic  shows,  however,  that  we  have  been  far  from
interpreting  these  obvious  matters  with  an  adequate  ‘grasp’,  still  less  with
regard  for  the  meaning  of  their  Being;  and  we  are  even  farther  from
possessing a stable coinage for the appropriate structural concepts.
 

i. Cf. Jakob Grimm, Kleinere Schriften, vol. VII, p. 247.

 

1. Reading ‘innan—wohnen’. As Heidegger points out in his footnote, this puzzling passage has
its source in Grimm’s Kleinere Schriften, Vol. VII, pp. 247 ff., where we find two short articles, the
first entitled ‘IN’ and the second ‘IN UND BEI’. The first article begins by comparing a number of
archaic  German  words  meaning  ‘domus’,  all  having  a  form  similar  to  our  English  ‘inn’,  which
Grimm  mentions.  He  goes  on  to  postulate  ‘a  strong  verb  “innan”,  which  must  have  meant  either
“habitare”, “domi esse”, or “recipere in domum” ’ (though  only a weak derivative form ‘innian’ is
actually found), with a surviving strong preterite written either as ‘an’ or as ‘ann’. Grimm goes on to
argue that the preposition ‘in’ is derived from the verb, rather than the verb from the preposition.

2. ‘…“an” bedeutet: ich bin gewohnt, vertraut mit, ich pflege etwas...’
In Grimm’s second article he adds: ‘there was also an anomalous “ann” with the plural “unnum”,
which expressed “amo”, “diligo”, “faveo”, and to which our “gönnen” and “Gunst” are immediately
related, as has long been recognized. “Ann” really means “ich bin eingewohnt”, “pflege zu bauen”;
this conceptual transition may be shown with minimal complication in the Latin “colo”, which stands
for “habito” as well as “diligo”.’

It  is  not  entirely  clear  whether  Heidegger’s  discussion  of  ‘an’  is  aimed  to  elucidate  the
preposition ‘an’ (which corresponds in some of its usages to the English ‘at’, and which he has just
used in remarking that the water and the glass are both at a location), or rather to explain the preterite
‘an’ of ‘innan’.

The reader should note that while the verb ‘wohnen’ normally means ‘to reside’ or ‘to dwell’, the
expression ‘ich bin gewohnt’ means ‘I am accustomed to’, and ‘ich bin eingewohnt’ means ‘I have
become accustomed to the place where I reside—to my surroundings’. Similarly ‘ich pflege etwas’
may mean either ‘I am accustomed to do something’ or ‘I take care of something’ or ‘I devote myself
to  it’.  (Grimm’s  ‘pflege  zu  bauen’  presumably  means  ‘I  am  accustomed  to  putting  my  trust  in
something’,  ‘I  can  build  on  it’.)  The  Latin,  ‘colo’  has  the  parallel  meanings  of  ‘I  take  care  of
something’ or ‘cherish’ it (‘diligo’) and ‘I dwell’ or ‘I inhabit’ (‘habito’).

3.  ‘...ich  wohne, halte  mich  auf bei... der Welt,  als  dem so und so Vertrauten.’ The  preposition
‘bei’, like ‘an’, does not have quite the semantical range of any English preposition. Our ‘alongside’,
with  which  we  shall  translate  it  when  other  devices  seem  less  satisfactory,  especially  in  the  phrase

‘Being alongside’ (‘Sein bei’), is often quite misleading; the sense here is closer to that of ‘at’ in such
expressions  as  ‘at  home’  or  ‘at  my  father’s’,  or  that  of  the  French  ‘chez’.  Here  again  Heidegger
seems to be relying upon Grimm, who proceeds (loc. cit.) to connect ‘bei’ with ‘bauen’ (‘build’) and
‘bin’.

4. ‘…in dem... Sinne des Aufgehens in der Welt...’ ‘Aufgehen’ means literally ‘to go up’, or ‘to
rise’ in the sense that the sun ‘rises’ or the dough ‘rises’. But when followed by the preposition ‘in’,
it  takes  on  other  meanings.  Thus  5  ‘geht  auf’  into  30  in  the  sense  that  it  ‘goes  into’  30  without
remainder; a country ‘geht auf’ into another country into which it is taken over or absorbed; a person
‘geht auf’ in anything to which he devotes himself fully, whether an activity or another person. We
shall usually translate ‘aufgehen’ by some form of ‘absorb’.

As  an  existentiale,  ‘Being  alongside’  the  world  never  means  anything
like  the  Being-present-at-hand-together  of  Things  that  occur.  There  is  no
such  thing  as  the  ‘side-by-side-ness’  of  an  entity  called  ‘Dasein’  with
another  entity  called  ‘world’.  Of  course  when  two  things  are  present-at-
hand together alongside one another,(1) we are accustomed to express this
occasionally by something like ‘The table stands “by” [“bei”] the door’ or
‘The  chair  “touches”  [“berührt”]  the  wall’.  Taken  strictly,  ‘touching’  is
never  what  we  are  talking  about  in  such  cases,  not  because  accurate
reexamination will always eventually establish that there is a space between
the chair and the wall, but because in principle the chair can never touch the
wall, even if the space between them should be equal to zero. If the chair
could touch the wall, this would presuppose that the wall is the sort of thing
‘for’  which  a  chair  would  be  encounterable.(2) An  entity  present-at-hand
within the world can be touched by another entity only if by its very nature
the  latter  entity  has  Being-in  as  its  own  kind  of  Being—only  if,  with  its
Being-there [Da-sein], something like the world is already revealed to it, so
that  from  out  of  that  world  another  entity  can  manifest  itself  in  touching,
and thus become accessible in its Being-present-at-hand. When two entities
are  present-at-hand  within  the  world,  and  furthermore  are  worldless  in
themselves, they can never ‘touch’ each other, nor can either of them ‘be’
‘alongside’ the  other.  The  clause  ‘furthermore  are  worldless’  must  not  be
left  out;  for  even  entities  which  are  not  worldless—Dasein  itself,  for
example—are  present-at-hand  ‘in’  the  world,  or,  more  exactly,  can  with
some right and within certain limits be taken as merely present-at-hand. To
do this, one must completely disregard or just not see the existential state of
Being-in.  But  the  fact  that  ‘Dasein’  can  be  taken  as  something  which  is
present-at-hand  and  just  present-at-hand,  is  not  to  be  confused  with  a
certain way of ‘presence-at-hand’ which is Dasein’s own. This latter kind of

presence-at-hand becomes accessible not by disregarding Dasein’s specific
structures but only by understanding them in advance.

2. ‘Voraussetzung dafür wäre, dass die Wand “für” den Stuhl begegnen könnte.’ (Cf. also H. 97

below.)

H. 56

 

Dasein understands its ownmost Being in the sense of a certain ‘factual
Being-present-at-hand’.(ii) And yet the ‘factuality’ of the fact [Tatsache] of
one’s own Dasein is at bottom quite different ontologically from the factual
occurrence of some kind of mineral, for example. Whenever Dasein is, it is
as  a  Fact;  and  the  factuality  of  such  a  Fact  is  what  we  shall  call  Dasein’s
“facticity”.(1) This  is  a  definite  way  of  Being  [Seinsbestimmtheit],  and  it
has  a  complicated  structure  which  cannot  even  be  grasped  as  a  problem
until Dasein’s basic existential states have been worked out. The concept of
“facticity” implies that an entity ‘within-the-world’ has Being-in-the-world
in such a way that it can understand itself as bound up in its ‘destiny’ with
the Being of those entities which it encounters within its own world.

In the first instance it is enough to see the ontological difference between
Being-in as an existentiale and the category of the ‘insideness’ which things
present-at-hand  can  have  with  regard  to  one  another.  By  thus  delimiting
Being-in,  we  are  not  denying  every  kind  of  ‘spatiality’  to  Dasein.  On  the
contrary, Dasein itself has a ‘Being-in-space’ of its own; but this in turn is
possible only on the basis of Being-in-the-world in general. Hence Being-in
is not to be explained ontologically by some ontical characterization, as if
one were to say, for instance, that Being-in in a world is a spiritual property,
and  that  man’s  ‘spatiality’  is  a  result  of  his  bodily  nature  (which,  at  the
same  time,  always  gets  ‘founded’  upon  corporeality).  Here  again  we  are
faced with the Being-present-at-hand-together of some such spiritual Thing
along  with  a  corporeal  Thing,  while  the  Being  of  the  entity  thus
compounded  remains  more  obscure  than  ever.  Not  until  we  understand
Being-in-the-world  as  an  essential  structure  of  Dasein  can  we  have  any
insight into Dasein’s existential spatiality. Such an insight will keep us from
failing  to  see  this  structure  or  from  previously  cancelling  it  out—a
procedure  motivated  not  ontologically  but  rather  ‘metaphysically’  by  the

naïve supposition that man is, in the first instance, a spiritual Thing which
subsequently gets misplaced ‘into’ a space.
 

ii. Cf. Section 29.

1.  ‘Die  Tatsächlichkeit  des  Faktums  Dasein,  als  welches  jeweilig  jedes  Dasein  ist,  nennen  wir
seine  Faktizität.’  We  shall  as  a  rule  translate  ‘Tatsächlichkeit’  as  ‘factuality’,  and  ‘Faktizität’  as
‘facticity’, following our conventions for ‘tatsächlich’ and ‘faktisch’. (See note 2, H. 7 above.) The
present  passage  suggests  a  comparable  distinction  between  the  nouns  ‘Tatsache’  and  ‘Faktum’;  so
while we find many passages where these seem to be used interchangeably, we translate ‘Faktum’ as
‘Fact’ with an initial capital, using ‘fact’ for ‘Tatsache’ and various other expressions. On ‘factuality’
and ‘facticity’ see also H. 135 below.

 

 

H. 57

it  go,  undertaking,  accomplishing,  evincing, 

Dasein’s  facticity  is  such  that  its  Being-in-the-world  has  always
dispersed  [zerstreut]  itself  or  even  split  itself  up  into  definite  ways  of
Being-in. The multiplicity of these is indicated by the following examples:
having to do with something, producing something, attending to something
and  looking  after  it,  making  use  of  something,  giving  something  up  and
letting 
interrogating,
considering,  discussing,  determining...  All  these  ways  of  Being-in  have
concern(1) as their kind of Being—a kind of Being which we have yet to
characterize in detail. Leaving undone, neglecting, renouncing, taking a rest
—these too are ways of concern; but these are all deficient modes, in which
the  possibilities  of  concern  are  kept  to  a  ‘bare  minimum’.(2)  The  term
‘concern’  has,  in  the  first  instance,  its  colloquial  [vorwissenschaftliche]
signification,  and  can  mean  to  carry  out  something,  to  get  it  done
[erledigen], to ‘straighten it out’. It can also mean to ‘provide oneself with
something’.(3)  We  use  the  expression  with  still  another  characteristic  turn
of  phrase  when  we  say  “I  am  concerned  for  the  success  of  the
undertaking.”(4)
 

1. ‘Besorgen’. As  Heidegger  points  out,  he  will  use  this  term  in  a  special  sense  which  is  to  be
distinguished from many of its customary usages. We shall, as a rule, translate it by ‘concern’, though
this  is  by  no  means  an  exact  equivalent.  The  English  word  ‘concern’  is  used  in  many  expressions
where  ‘Besorgen’  would  be  inappropriate  in  German,  such  as  ‘This  concerns  you’,  ‘That  is  my
concern’, ‘He has an interest in several banking concerns’. ‘Besorgen’ stands rather for the kind of
‘concern’  in  which  we  ‘concern  ourselves’  with  activities  which  we  perform  or  things  which  we
procure.

2. ‘…alle Modi des “Nur noch” in bezug auf Möglichkeiten des Besorgens.’ The point is that in

these cases concern is just barely (‘nur noch’) involved.

3. ‘…sich etwas besorgen im Sinne von “sich etwas verschaffen”.’
4.  ‘…ich  besorge,  dass  das  Unternehmen  misslingt.’  Here  it  is  not  difficult  to  find  a
corresponding usage of ‘concern’, as our version suggests. But the analogy is imperfect. While we
can  say  that  we  are  ‘concerned  for  the  success  of  the  enterprise’  or  ‘concerned  lest  the  enterprise
should  fail,’  we  would  hardly  follow  the  German  to  the  extent  of  expressing  ‘concern  that’  the
enterprise  should  fail;  nor  would  the  German  express  ‘Besorgen’  at  discovering  that  the  enterprise
has failed already.

Here  ‘concern’  means  something  like  apprehensiveness.  In  contrast  to
these colloquial ontical significations, the expression ‘concern’ will be used
in  this  investigation  as  an  ontological  term  for  an  existentiale,  and  will
designate the Being of a possible way of Being-in-the-world. This term has
been  chosen  not  because  Dasein  happens  to  be  proximally  and  to  a  large
extent ‘practical’ and economic, but because the Being of Dasein itself is to
be  made  visible  as  care.(1)  This  expression  too  is  to  be  taken  as  an
ontological  structural  concept.  (See  Chapter  6  of  this  Division.)  It  has
nothing to do with ‘tribulation’, ‘melancholy’, or the ‘cares of life’, though
ontically  one  can  come  across  these  in  every  Dasein.  These—like  their
opposites,  ‘gaiety’  and  ‘freedom  from  care’—are  ontically  possible  only
because Dasein, when understood ontologically, is care. Because Being-in-
the-world belongs essentially to Dasein, its Being towards the world [Sein
zur Welt] is essentially concern.

From  what  we  have  been  saying,  it  follows  that  Being-in  is  not  a
‘property’ which Dasein sometimes has and sometimes does not have, and
without which it could be just as well as it could with it. It is not the case
that  man  ‘is’  and  then  has,  by  way  of  an  extra,  a  relationship-of-Being
towards the ‘world’—a world with which he provides himself occasionally.
(2) Dasein is never ‘proximally’ an entity which is, so to speak, free from
Being-in,  but  which  sometimes  has  the  inclination  to  take  up  a
‘relationship’ towards the world. Taking up relationships towards the world
is possible only because Dasein, as Being-in-the-world, is as it is. This state
of  Being  does  not  arise  just  because  some  other  entity  is  present-at-hand
outside of Dasein and meets up with it. Such an entity can ‘meet up with’
Dasein only in so far as it can, of its own accord, show itself within a world.
 

1. ‘Sorge’. The important etymological connection between ‘Besorgen’ (‘concern’) and ‘Sorge’

(‘care’) is lost in our translation. On ‘Sorge’ see especially Sections 41 and 42 below.

gelegentlich zulegt.’

Nowadays  there  is  much  talk  about  ‘man’s  having  an  environment
[Umwelt]’;  but  this  says  nothing  ontologically  as  long  as  this  ‘having’  is
left  indefinite.  In  its  very  possibility  this  ‘having’  is  founded  upon  the
existential  state  of  Being-in.  Because  Dasein  is  essentially  an  entity  with
Being-in,  it  can  explicitly  discover  those  entities  which  it  encounters
environmentally, it can know them, it can avail  itself of them, it can have
the ‘world’. To talk about ‘having an environment’ is ontically trivial, but
ontologically  it  presents  a  problem.  To  solve  it  requires  nothing  else  than
defining the Being of Dasein, and doing so in a way which is ontologically
adequate.  Although  this  state  of  Being  is  one  of  which  use  has  made  in
biology,  especially  since  K.  von  Baer,  one  must  not  conclude  that  its
philosophical  use  implies  ‘biologism’.  For  the  environment  is  a  structure
which  even  biology  as  a  positive  science  can  never  find  and  can  never
define, but must presuppose and constantly employ. Yet, even as an a priori
condition  for  the  objects  which  biology  takes  for  its  theme,  this  structure
itself  can  be  explained  philosophically  only  if  it  has  been  conceived
beforehand as a structure of Dasein. Only in terms of an orientation towards
the  ontological  structure  thus  conceived  can  ‘life’  as  a  state  of  Being  be
defined a priori, and this must be done in a privative manner.(1) Ontically
as  well  as  ontologically,  the  priority  belongs  to  Being-in-the  world  as
concern.  In  the  analytic  of  Dasein  this  structure  undergoes  a  basic
Interpretation.
 

1. ‘…auf dem Wege der Privation...’ The point is that in order to understand life merely as such,

we must make abstraction from the fuller life of Dasein. See H. 50 above.

But  have  we  not  confined  ourselves  to  negative  assertions  in  all  our
attempts to determine the nature of this state of Being? Though this Being-
in  is  supposedly so fundamental,  we  always keep hearing about  what it is
not. Yes indeed. But there is nothing accidental about our characterizing it
predominantly  in  so  negative  a  manner.  In  doing  so  we  have  rather  made
known  what  is  peculiar  to  this  phenomenon,  and  our  characterization  is
therefore  positive  in  a  genuine  sense—a  sense  appropriate  to  the

is 

itself.  When 

Being-in-the-world 

exhibited
phenomenon 
phenomenologically,  disguises  and  concealments  are  rejected  because this
phenomenon itself always gets ‘seen’ in a certain way in every Dasein. And
it thus gets ‘seen’ because it makes up a basic state of Dasein, and in every
case is already disclosed for Dasein’s understanding of Being, and disclosed
along  with  that  Being  itself.  But  for  the  most  part  this  phenomenon  has
been  explained  in  a  way  which  is  basically  wrong,  or  interpreted  in  an
ontologically inadequate manner. On the other hand, this ‘seeing in a certain
way  and  yet  for  the  most  part  wrongly  explaining’  is  itself  based  upon
nothing  else  than  this  very  state  of  Dasein’s  Being,  which  is  such  that
Dasein  itself—and  this  means  also  its  Being-in-the  world—gets  its
ontological  understanding  of  itself  in  the  first  instance  from  those  entities
which it itself is not but which it encounters ‘within’ its world, and from the
Being which they possess.

H. 59

 

Both  i n  Dasein and  f o r  it, this state of Being is always in some way
familiar  [bekannt].  Now  if  it  is  also  to  become  known  [erkannt],  the
knowing which such a task explicitly implies  takes itself  (as  a knowing of
the  world  [Welterkennen])  as  the  chief  exemplification  of  the  ‘soul’s’
relationship to the world. Knowing the world (νοεῖν)—or rather addressing
oneself  to  the  ‘world’  and  discussing  it  (λόγος)—thus  functions  as  the
primary mode of Being-in-the-world, even though Being-in-the-world does
not  as  such  get  conceived.  But  because  this  structure  of  Being  remains
ontologically  inaccessible,  yet  is  experienced  ontically  as  a  ‘relationship’
between  one  entity  (the  world)  and  another  (the  soul),  and  because  one
proximally understands Being by taking entities as entities within-the-world
for  one’s  ontological  foothold,  one  tries  to  conceive  the  relationship
between world and soul as grounded in these two entities themselves and in
the  meaning  of  their  Being—namely,  to  conceive  it  as  Being-present-at-
hand. And even though Being-in-the-world is something of which one has
pre-phenomenological experience and acquaintance [erfahren und gekannt],
it  becomes  invisible  if  one  interprets  it  in  a  way  which  is  ontologically
inappropriate.  This  state  of  Dasein’s  Being  is  now  one  with  which  one  is
just barely acquainted (and indeed as something obvious), with the stamp of
an  inappropriate  interpretation.  So  in  this  way  it  becomes  the  ‘evident’

point  of  departure  for  problems  of  epistemology  or  the  ‘metaphysics  of
knowledge’. For what is more obvious than that a ‘subject’ is related to an
‘Object’  and  vice  versa?  This  ‘subject-Object-relationship’  must  be
presupposed. But while this presupposition is unimpeachable in its facticity,
this makes it indeed a baleful one, if its ontological necessity and especially
its ontological meaning are to be left in the dark.

Thus the phenomenon of Being-in has for the most part been represented
exclusively  by  a  single  exemplar—knowing  the  world.  This  has  not  only
been  the  case  in  epistemology;  for  even  practical  behaviour  has  been
understood  as  behaviour  which  is  ‘non-theoretical’  and  ‘atheoretical’.
Because  knowing  has  been  given  this  priority,  our  understanding  of  its
ownmost kind of Being gets led astray, and accordingly Being-in-the-world
must  be  exhibited  even  more  precisely  with  regard  to  knowing  the  world,
and must itself be made visible as an existential ‘modality’ of Being-in.

13. A Founded Mode in which Being-in is Exemplified. Knowing the

1. ‘Die Exemplifizierung des In-Seins an einem fundierten Modus.’ The conception of ‘founded’
modes  is  taken  from  Husserl,  who  introduces  the  concept  of  ‘founding’  in  his  Logische
Untersuchungen, vol. II, Part I, chapter 2 (second edition, Halle, 1913, p. 261). This passage has been
closely  paraphrased  as  follows  by  Marvin  Farber  in  his  The  Foundation  of  Phenomenology,
Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1943, p. 297; ‘If in accordance with essential law an α can only exist in a
comprehensive unity which connects it with a μ, then we say, an α as such needs foundation through
a μ, or also, an α as such is in need of completion by means of a μ. If accordingly α0, μ0 are definite
particular  cases  of  the  pure  genera  α,  or  μ,  which  stand  in  the  cited  relationship,  and  if  they  are
members of one whole, then say that α0 is founded by μ0; and it is exclusively founded by μ0 if the
need of the completion of α0 is alone satisfied by μ0. This terminology can be applied to the species
themselves; the equivocation is harmless.’ Thus a founded mode of Being-in is simply a mode which
can subsist only when connected with something else.

World.
 

H. 60

 

If Being-in-the-world is a basic state of Dasein, and one in which Dasein
operates not only in general but pre-eminently in the mode of everydayness,
then  it  must  also  be  something  which  has  always  been  experienced
ontically. It would be unintelligible for Being-in-the-world to remain totally
veiled  from  view,  especially  since  Dasein  has  at  its  disposal  an
this
its  own  Being,  no  matter  how 
understanding  of 

indefinitely 

understanding  may  function.  But  no  sooner  was  the  ‘phenomenon  of
knowing the world’ grasped than it got interpreted in a ‘superficial’, formal
manner.  The  evidence  for  this  is  the  procedure  (still  customary  today)  of
setting up knowing as a ‘relation between subject and Object’—a procedure
in which there lurks as much ‘truth’ as vacuity. But subject and Object do
not coincide with Dasein and the world.

Even  if  it  were  feasible  to  give  an  ontological  definition  of  “Being-in”
primarily  in  terms  of  a  Being-in-the-world  which  knows,  it  would  still  be
our first task to show that knowing has the phenomenal character of a Being
which is in and towards the world. If one reflects upon this relationship of
Being, an entity called “Nature” is given proximally as that which becomes
known. Knowing, as such, is not to be met in this entity. If knowing ‘is’ at
all,  it  belongs  solely  to  those  entities  which  know.  But  even  in  those
entities,  human-Things,  knowing  is  not  present-at-hand.  In  any  case,  it  is
not  externally  ascertainable  as,  let  us  say,  bodily  properties  are.(1)  Now,
inasmuch  as  knowing  belongs  to  these  entities  and  is  not  some  external
characteristic,  it  must  be  ‘inside’.  Now  the  more  unequivocally  one
maintains that knowing is proximally and really ‘inside’ and indeed has by
no  means  the  same  kind  of  Being  as  entities  which  are  both  physical  and
psychical,  the  less  one  presupposes  when  one  believes  that  one  is  making
headway  in  the  question  of  the  essence  of  knowledge  and  in  the
clarification of the  relationship between subject  and Object. For  only  then
can  the  problem  arise  of  how  this  knowing  subject  comes  out  of  its  inner
‘sphere’ into one which is ‘other and external’, of how knowing can have
any  object  at  all,  and  of  how  one  must  think  of  the  object  itself  so  that
eventually  the  subject  knows  it  without  needing  to  venture  a  leap  into
another  sphere.  But  in  any  of  the  numerous  varieties  which  this  approach
may take, the question of the kind of Being which belongs to this knowing
subject is left entirely unasked, though whenever its knowing gets handled,
its way of Being is already included tacitly in one’s theme. Of course we are
sometimes  assured  that  we  are  certainly  not  to  think  of  the  subject’s
“inside”  [Innen]  and  its  ‘inner  sphere’  as  a  sort  of  ‘box’  or  ‘cabinet’.  But
when one asks for the positive signification of this ‘inside’ of immanence in
which  knowing  is  proximally  enclosed,  or  when  one  inquires  how  this
‘Being  inside’  [“Innenseins”]  which  knowing  possesses  has  its  own
character  of  Being  grounded  in  the  kind  of  Being  which  belongs  to  the
subject,  then  silence reigns. And no matter how this inner  sphere  may  get

interpreted, if one does no more than ask how knowing makes its way ‘out
of’  it  and  achieves  ‘transcendence’,  it  becomes  evident  that  the  knowing
which  presents  such  enigmas  will  remain  problematical  unless  one  has
previously clarified how it is and what it is.
 

1.  ‘In  jedem  Falle  ist  est  nicht  so  äusserlich  feststellbar  wie  etwa  leibliche  Eigenschaften.  The

older editions have ‘…nicht ist es...’ and place a comma after ‘feststellbar’.

H. 61

 

With this kind of approach one remains blind to what is already tacitly
implied even when one takes the phenomenon of knowing as one’s theme in
the most provisional manner: namely, that knowing is a mode of Being of
Dasein  as  Being-in-the-world,  and  is  founded  ontically  upon  this  state  of
Being. But if, as we suggest, we thus find phenomenally that knowing is a
kind  of  Being  which  belongs  to  Being-in-the-world,  one  might  object  that
with  such  an  Interpretation  of  knowing,  the  problem  of  knowledge  is
nullified;  for  what  is  left  to  be  asked  if  one  presupposes  that  knowing  is
already  ‘alongside’  its  world,  when  it  is  not  supposed  to  reach  that  world
except in the transcending of the subject? In this question the constructivist
‘standpoint’, which has not been phenomenally demonstrated, again comes
to the fore; but quite apart from this, what higher court is to decide whether
and in what sense there is to be any problem of knowledge other than that
of  the  phenomenon  of  knowing  as  such  and  the  kind  of  Being  which
belongs to the knower?

If  we  now  ask  what  shows  itself  in  the  phenomenal  findings  about
knowing, we must keep in mind that knowing is grounded beforehand in a
Being-already-alongside-the-world,  which  is  essentially  constitutive  for
Dasein’s  Being.(1)  Proximally,  this  Being-already-alongside  is  not  just  a
fixed  staring  at  something  that  is  purely  present-at-hand.  Being-in-the-
world, as concern, is fascinated by the world with which it is concerned.(2)
If  knowing  is  to  be  possible  as  a  way  of  determining  the  nature  of  the
present-at-hand  by  observing  it,(3)  then  there  must  first  be  a  deficiency in
our  having-to-do  with  the  world  concernfully.  When  concern  holds  back
[Sichenthalten]  from  any  kind  of  producing,  manipulating,  and  the  like,  it
puts itself into what is now the sole remaining mode of Being-in, the mode
of  just  tarrying  alongside...  [das  Nur-noch-verweilen  bei…]  This  kind  of

Being towards the world is one which lets us encounter entities within-the-
world purely in the way they look (εἶδος), just that; on the basis of this kind
of  Being,  and  as a  mode  of  it,  looking  explicitly  at  what  we  encounter  is
possible.(4) Looking at something in this way is sometimes a definite way
of taking up  a direction towards  something—of setting our sights  towards
what  is  present-at-hand.  It  takes  over  a  ‘view-point’  in  advance  from  the
entity which it encounters.
 

1. ‘…dass das Erkennen selbst vorgängig gründet in einem Schon-sein-bei-der-Welt, als welches

das Sein von Dasein wesenhaft konstituiert.’

2. ‘Das In-der-Welt-sein ist als Besorgen von der besorgten Welt benommen.’ Here we follow the

older editions. The newer editions have ‘das Besorgen’ instead of ‘als Besorgen’.

3. ‘Damit Erkennen als betrachtendes Bestimmen des Vorhandenen möglich sei…’ Here too we

follow the older editions. The newer editions again have ‘das’ instead of ‘als’.

4. ‘Auf dem Grunde dieser Seinsart zur Welt, die das innerweltlich begegnende Seiende nur noch
in  seinem  puren  Aussehen  (εἶδος)  begegnen  lässt,  und  als  Modus  dieser  Seinsart  ist  ein
ausdruckliches Hinsehen auf das so Begenende möglich.’

H. 62

 

Such  looking-at  enters  the  mode  of  dwelling  autonomously  alongside
entities within-the-world.(1) In this kind of ‘dwelling’ as a holding-oneself-
back from any manipulation or utilization, the perception of the present-at-
hand  is  consummated.(2)  Perception  is  consummated  when  one  addresses
oneself  to  something  as  something  and  discusses  it  as  such.(3)  This
amounts  to  interpretation in  the  broadest  sense;  and  on  the  basis  of  such
interpretation, perception becomes an act of making determinate.(4) What is
thus perceived and made determinate can be expressed in propositions, and
can  be  retained  and  preserved  as  what  has  thus  been  asserted.  This
perceptive  retention  of  an  assertion(5)  about  something  is  itself  a  way  of
Being-in-the-world; it is not to be Interpreted as a ‘procedure’ by which a
subject  provides  itself  with  representations  [Vorstellungen]  of  something
which remain stored up ‘inside’ as having been thus appropriated, and with
regard  to  which  the  question  of  how  they  ‘agree’  with  actuality  can
occasionally arise.
 

1. ‘Solches Hinsehen kommt selbst in den Modus eines eigenständigen Sichaufhaltens bei dem

innerweltlichen Seienden.’

2. ‘In sogearteten “Aufenthalt”—als dem Sichenthalten von jeglicher Hantierung and Nutzung—
vollzieht sich das Vernehmen des Vorhandenen.’ The word ‘Aufenthalt’ normally means a stopping-
off at some place, a sojourn, an abiding, or even an abode or dwelling. Here the author is exploiting

the fact that it includes both the prefixes ‘auf-’ and ‘ent-’, which we find in the verbs ‘aufhalten’ and
‘enthalten’. ‘Aufhalten’ means to hold something at a stage which it has reached, to arrest it, to stop
it;  when  used  reflexively  it  can  mean  to  stay  at  a  place,  to  dwell  there.  While  ‘enthalten’  usually
means to contain, it preserves its more literal meaning of holding back or refraining, when it is used
reflexively. All these meanings are presumably packed into the word ‘Aufenthalt’ as used here, and
are hardly suggested by our ‘dwelling’.

3. ‘Das Vernehmen hat die Vollzugsart des Ansprechens und Besprechens von etwas als etwas.’
On ‘something as something’ see Section 32 below (H. 149), where ‘interpretation’ is also discussed.

4. ‘…wird das Vernehmen zum Bestimmen.’
5. ‘Aussage’. For further discussion see Section 33 below.

When Dasein directs itself towards something and grasps it, it does not
somehow  first  get  out  of  an  inner  sphere  in  which  it  has  been  proximally
encapsulated,  but  its  primary  kind  of  Being  is  such  that  it  is  always
‘outside’ alongside entities which it encounters and which belong to a world
already discovered. Nor is any inner sphere abandoned when Dasein dwells
alongside the entity to be known, and determines its character; but even in
this  ‘Being-outside’  alongside  the  object,  Dasein  is  still  ‘inside’,  if  we
understand  this  in  the  correct  sense;  that  is  to  say,  it  is  itself  ‘inside’  as  a
Being-in-the-world which knows. And furthermore, the perceiving of what
is known is not a process of returning with one’s booty to the ‘cabinet’ of
consciousness  after  one  has  gone  out  and  grasped  it;  even  in  perceiving,
retaining, and preserving, the Dasein which knows remains outside,  and it
does so as Dasein. If I ‘merely’ know [Wissen] about some way in which
the Being of entities is interconnected, if I ‘only’ represent them, if I ‘do no
more’ than ‘think’ about them, I am no less alongside the entities outside in
the  world  than  when  I  originally  grasp  them.(1)  Even  the  forgetting  of
something, in which every relationship of Being towards what one formerly
knew has seemingly been obliterated, must be conceived as a modification
of the primordial Being-in; and this holds for every delusion and for every
error.

We have now pointed out how those modes of Being-in-the-world which
are  constitutive  for  knowing  the  world  are  interconnected  in  their
foundations;  this  makes  it  plain  that  in  knowing,  Dasein  achieves  a  new
status  of  Being  [Seinsstand]  towards  a  world  which  has  already  been
discovered in Dasein itself. This new possibility of Being can develop itself
autonomously;  it  can  become  a  task  to  be  accomplished,  and  as  scientific
knowledge  it  can  take  over  the  guidance  for  Being-in-the-world.  But  a
‘commercium’ of the subject with a world does not get created for the first
time by knowing, nor does it arise from some way in which the world acts

upon a subject. Knowing is a mode of Dasein founded upon Being-in-the-
world.  Thus  Being-in-the-world,  as  a  basic  state,  must  be  Interpreted
beforehand.

III: THE WORLDHOOD OF THE WORLD

 

 

 

H. 63

14. The Idea of the Worldhood of the World in General

1.  “Welt’,  ‘weltlich’,  ‘Weltlichkeit’,  “Weltmässigkeit’.  We  shall  usually  translate  ‘Welt’  as  ‘the
world’ or ‘a world’, following English idiom, though Heidegger frequently omits the article when he
wishes to refer to ‘Welt’ as a ‘characteristic’ of Dasein. In ordinary German the adjective ‘weltlich’
and the derivative noun ‘Weltlichkeit’ have much the same connotations as the English ‘worldly’ and
‘worldliness’;  but  the  meanings  which  Heidegger  assigns  to  them  (H.  65)  are  quite  different  from
those  of  their  English  cognates.  At  the  risk  of  obscuring  the  etymological  connection  and
occasionally  misleading  the  reader,  we  shall  translate  ‘weltlich’  as  ‘worldly’,  ‘Weltlichkeit’  as
‘worldhood’, and ‘Weltmässigkeit’ as ‘worldly character’. The reader must bear in mind, however,
that there is no suggestion here of the ‘worldliness’ of the ‘man of the world’.

BEING-IN-THE-WORLD shall first be made visible with regard to that
item  of  its  structure  which  is  the  ‘world’  itself.  To  accomplish  this  task
seems easy and so trivial as to make one keep taking for granted that it may
be  dispensed  with.  What  can  be  meant  by  describing  ‘the  world’  as  a
phenomenon? It means to let us see what shows itself in ‘entities’ within the
world. Here the first step is to enumerate the things that are ‘in’ the world:
houses, trees, people, mountains, stars. We can depict the way such entities
‘look’, and we can give an account of occurrences in them and with them.
This,  however,  is  obviously  a  pre-phenomenological  ‘business’  which
cannot be at all relevant phenomenologically. Such a description is always
confined to entities. It is ontical. But what we are seeking is Being. And we
have formally defined ‘phenomenon’ in the phenomenological sense as that
which shows itself as Being and as a structure of Being.

Thus, to give a phenomenological description of the ‘world’ will mean to
exhibit  the  Being  of  those  entities  which  are  present-at-hand  within  the
world, and to fix it in concepts which are categorial. Now the entities within
the world are Things—Things of Nature, and Things ‘invested with value’
[“wertbehaftete”  Dinge].  Their  Thinghood  becomes  a  problem;  and  to  the

extent that the Thinghood of Things ‘invested with value’ is based upon the
Thinghood of Nature, our primary theme is the Being of Things of Nature
—Nature as such. That characteristic of Being which belongs to Things of
is
Nature 
substantiality.  What  is  its  ontological  meaning?  By  asking  this,  we  have
given an unequivocal direction to our inquiry.

(substances),  and  upon  which  everything 

founded, 

is 

But  is  this  a  way  of  asking  ontologically  about  the  ‘world’?  The
problematic  which  we  have  thus  marked  out  is  one  which  is  undoubtedly
ontological.  But  even  if  this  ontology  should  itself  succeed  in  explicating
the Being of Nature in the very purest manner, in conformity with the basic
assertions  about  this  entity,  which  the  mathematical  natural  sciences
provide,  it  will  never  reach  the  phenomenon  that  is  the  ‘world’.  Nature  is
itself  an  entity  which  is  encountered  within  the  world  and  which  can  be
discovered in various ways and at various stages.

H. 64

 

Should we then first attach ourselves to those entities with which Dasein
proximally and for the most part dwells—Things ‘invested with value’? Do
not these ‘really’ show us the world in which we live? Perhaps, in fact, they
show  us  something  like  the  ‘world’  more  penetratingly.  But  these  Things
too are entities ‘within’ the world.

Neither  the  ontical  depiction  of  entities  within-the-world  nor  the
ontological  Interpretation  of  their  Being  is  such  as  to  reach  the
phenomenon  of  the  ‘world.’  In both  of these ways  of access to  ‘Objective
Being’, the ‘world’ has already been ‘presupposed’, and indeed in various
ways.

Is it possible that ultimately we cannot address ourselves to ‘the world’
as determining the nature of the entity we have mentioned? Yet we call this
entity one which is  “within-the-world”. Is ‘world’  perhaps  a characteristic
of Dasein’s Being? And in that case, does every Dasein ‘proximally’ have
its  world?  Does  not  ‘world’  thus  become  something  ‘subjective’?  How,
then, can there be a ‘common’ world ‘in’ which, nevertheless, we are? And
if  we  raise  the  question  of  the  ‘world’,  what  world  do  we  have  in  view?
Neither the common world nor the subjective world, but the worldhood of
the world as such. By what avenue do we meet this phenomenon?

‘Worldhood’  is  an  ontological  concept,  and  stands  for  the  structure  of
one of the constitutive items of Being-in-the-world. But we know Being-in-
the-world  as  a  way  in  which  Dasein’s  character  is  defined  existentially.
Thus  worldhood  itself  is  an  existentiale.  If  we  inquire  ontologically  about
the ‘world’, we by no means abandon the analytic of Dasein as a field for
thematic study. Ontologically, ‘world’ is not a way of characterizing those
entities which Dasein essentially is not; it is rather a characteristic of Dasein
itself.  This  does  not  rule  out  the  possibility  that  when  we  investigate  the
phenomenon of the ‘world’ we must do so by the avenue of entities within-
the-world  and  the  Being  which  they  possess.  The  task  of  ‘describing’  the
world  phenomenologically  is  so  far  from  obvious  that  even  if  we  do  no
more  than  determine  adequately  what  form  it  shall  take,  essential
ontological clarifications will be needed.

This  discussion  of  the  word  ‘world’,  and  our  frequent  use  of  it  have
made it apparent that it is used in several ways. By unravelling these we can
get an indication of the different kinds of phenomena that are signified, and
of the way in which they are interconnected.

1.  “World”  is  used  as  an  ontical  concept,  and  signifies  the  totality  of

those entities which can be present-at-hand within the world.

H. 65

 

2. “World” functions  as an ontological  term,  and signifies  the  Being  of
those  entities  which  we  have  just  mentioned.  And  indeed  ‘world’  can
become a term for any realm which encompasses a multiplicity of entities:
for  instance,  when  one  talks  of  the  ‘world’  of  a  mathematician,  ‘world’
signifies the realm of possible objects of mathematics.

3. “World” can be understood in another ontical sense—not, however, as
those entities which Dasein essentially is not and which can be encountered
within-the-world, but rather as that ‘wherein’ a factical Dasein as such can
be  said 
to  ‘live’.  “World”  has  here  a  pre-ontological  existentiell
signification. Here again there are different possibilities: “world” may stand
for  the  ‘public’  we-world,  or  one’s  ‘own’  closest  (domestic)  environment.
(1)
 

1. ‘…die “eigene” und nächste (häusliche) Umwelt.’ The word ‘Umwelt’, which is customarily
translated  as  ‘environment’,  means  literally  the  ‘world  around’  or  the  ‘world  about’.  The  prefix
‘um-’, however, not only may mean ‘around’ or ‘about’, but, as we shall see, can also be used in an

expression  such  as  ‘um  zu...’,  which  is  most  easily  translated  as  ‘in  order  to’.  Section  15  will  be
largely  devoted  to  a  study  of  several  words  in  which  this  same  prefix  occurs,  though  this  is  by  no
means apparent in the words we have chosen to represent them: ‘Umgang’ (‘dealings’); ‘das Um-zu’
(‘the “in-order-to” ’); ‘Umsicht’ (‘circumspection’).

4.  Finally,  “world”  designates  the  ontologico-existential  concept  of
worldhood.  Worldhood  itself  may  have  as  its  modes  whatever  structural
wholes any special ‘worlds’ may have at the time; but it embraces in itself
the  a  priori  character  of  worldhood  in  general.  We  shall  reserve  the
expression  “world”  as  a  term  for  our  third  signification.  If  we  should
sometimes use it in the first of these senses, we shall mark this with single
quotation marks.

The derivative form ‘worldly’ will then apply terminologically to a kind
of Being which belongs to Dasein, never to a kind which belongs to entities
present-at-hand  ‘in’  the  world.  We  shall  designate  these  latter  entities  as
“belonging  to  the  world”  or  “within-the-world”  [weltzugehörig  oder
innerweltlich].

A glance at previous ontology shows that if one fails to see Being-in-the-
world  as  a  state  of  Dasein,  the  phenomenon  of  worldhood  likewise  gets
passed over. One tries instead to Interpret the world in terms of the Being of
those entities which are present-at-hand within-the-world but which are by
no  means  proximally  discovered—namely,  in  terms  of  Nature.  If  one
understands  Nature  ontologico-categorially,  one  finds  that  Nature  is  a
limiting  case  of  the  Being  of  possible  entities  within-the-world.  Only  in
some  definite  mode  of  its  own  Being-in-the-world  can  Dasein  discover
entities  as  Nature.(1)  This  manner  of  knowing  them  has  the  character  of
depriving  the  world  of  its  worldhood  in  a  definite  way.  ‘Nature’,  as  the
categorial  aggregate  of  those  structures  of  Being  which  a  definite  entity
encountered  within-the-world  may  possess,  can  never  make  worldhood
intelligible.  But  even  the  phenomenon  of  ‘Nature’,  as  it  is  conceived,  for
instance, in romanticism, can be grasped ontologically only in terms of the
concept of the world—that is to say, in terms of the analytic of Dasein.

seins entdecken.’

When  it  comes  to  the  problem  of  analysing  the  world’s  worldhood
ontologically,  traditional  ontology  operates  in  a  blind  alley,  if,  indeed,  it
sees  this  problem  at  all.  On  the  other  hand,  if  we  are  to  Interpret  the
worldhood  of  Dasein  and  the  possible  ways  in  which  Dasein  is  made
worldly [Verweltlichung], we must show why the kind of Being with which
Dasein  knows  the  world  is  such  that  it  passes  over  the  phenomenon  of
worldhood both ontically and ontologically. But at the same time the very
Fact of this passing-over suggests that we must take special precautions to
get the right phenomenal point of departure [Ausgang] for access [Zugang]
to the phenomenon of worldhood, so that it will not get passed over.

Our  method has already been assigned [Anweisung]. The theme  of our
analytic is to be Being-in-the-world, and accordingly the very world itself;
and these are to be considered within the horizon of average everydayness
—the kind of Being which is closest to  Dasein. We must make a study  of
everyday  Being-in-the-world;  with  the  phenomenal  support  which  this
gives us, something like the world must come into view.

From  this  point  of  view,  Dasein’s  spatiality,  of  which  we  have  given  an
indication  in  Section  12,  becomes  phenomenally  visible.  In  ontology,

Interpret the Being of the ‘world’ as res extensa.  In Descartes we  find  the
most  extreme  tendency  towards  such  an  ontology  of  the  ‘world’,  with,
indeed,  a  counter-orientation  towards  the  res  cogitans—which  does  not
coincide  with  Dasein  either  ontically  or  ontologically.  The  analysis  of
worldhood  which  we  are  here  attempting  can  be  made  clearer  if  we  show
how  it  differs  from  such  an  ontological  tendency.  Our  analysis  will  be
completed  in  three  stages:  (A)  the  analysis  of  environmentality  and

worldhood  in  general;  (B) an  illustrative  contrast  between  our  analysis  of
worldhood and Descartes’ ontology of the ‘world’; (C) the aroundness [das
Umhafte] of the environment, and the ‘spatiality’ of Dasein.(1)

15. The Being of the Entities Encountered in the Environment

 

 

 

H. 67

The Being of those entities which we encounter as closest to us can be
exhibited phenomenologically if we take as our clue our everyday Being-in-
the-world,  which  we  also  call  our  “dealings”(2)  in  the  world  and  with
entities within-the-world. Such dealings have already dispersed themselves
into manifold ways of concern.(3) The kind of dealing which is closest to us
is as we have shown, not a bare perceptual cognition, but rather that kind of
concern which manipulates things and puts them to use; and this has its own
kind  of  ‘knowledge’.  The  phenomenological  question  applies  in  the  first
instance to the Being of those entities which we encounter in such concern.
To assure the kind of seeing which is here required, we must first make a
remark about method.
 

1. A is considered in Sections 15-18; B in Sections 19-21; C in Sections 22-24.
2. ‘Umgang’. This word means literally a ‘going around’ or ‘going about’, in a sense not too far
removed  from  what  we  have  in  mind  when  we  say  that  someone  is  ‘going  about  his  business’.
‘Dealings’ is by no means an accurate translation, but is perhaps as convenient as any. ‘Intercourse’
and ‘trafficking’ are also possible translations.

3. See above, H. 57, n. 1.

In the disclosure and explication of Being, entities are in every case our
preliminary  and  our  accompanying  theme  [das  Vor-und  Mitthematische];
but  our  real  theme  is  Being.  In  the  domain  of  the  present  analysis,  the
entities  we  shall  take  as  our  preliminary  theme  are  those  which  show
themselves  in  our  concern  with  the  environment.  Such  entities  are  not
thereby objects for knowing the ‘world’ theoretically; they are simply what
gets used, what gets produced, and so forth. As entities so encountered, they
become  the  preliminary  theme  for  the  purview  of  a  ‘knowing’  which,  as

phenomenological,  looks  primarily  towards  Being,  and  which,  in  thus
taking Being  as its theme,  takes these entities as its accompanying  theme.
This phenomenological interpretation is accordingly not a way of knowing
those  characteristics  of  entities  which  themselves    a  r  e    [seiender
Beschaffenheiten des Seienden]; it is rather a determination of the structure
of  the  Being  which  entities  possess.  But  as  an  investigation  of  Being,  it
brings  to  completion,  autonomously  and  explicitly,  that  understanding  of
Being which belongs already to Dasein and which ‘comes alive’ in any of
its dealings with entities. Those entities which serve phenomenologically as
our preliminary theme—in this case, those which are used or which are to
be  found  in  the  course  of  production—become  accessible  when  we  put
ourselves into the position of concerning ourselves with them in some such
way. Taken strictly, this talk about “putting ourselves into such a position”
[Sichversetzen] is misleading; for the kind of Being which belongs to such
concernful  dealings  is  not  one  into  which  we  need  to  put  ourselves  first.
This is the way in which everyday Dasein always is: when I open the door,
for instance, I use the latch. The achieving of phenomenological access to
the  entities  which  we  encounter,  consists  rather  in  thrusting  aside  our
interpretative  tendencies,  which  keep  thrusting  themselves  upon  us  and
running along with us, and which conceal not only the phenomenon of such
‘concern’, but even more those entities themselves as  encountered of their
own accord in our concern with them. These entangling errors become plain
if  in  the  course  of  our  investigation  we  now  ask  which  entities  shall  be
taken as our preliminary theme and established as the pre-phenomenal basis
for our study.

H. 68

 

One  may  answer:  “Things.”  But  with  this  obvious  answer  we  have
perhaps  already  missed  the  pre-phenomenal  basis  we  are  seeking.  For  in
addressing these entities as ‘Things’ (res), we have tacitly anticipated their
ontological character. When analysis starts with such entities and goes on to
inquire  about  Being,  what  it  meets  is  Thinghood  and  Reality.  Ontological
explication  discovers,  as  it  proceeds,  such  characteristics  of  Being  as
substantiality, materiality, extendedness, side-by-side-ness, and so forth. But
even  pre-ontologically,  in  such  Being  as  this,  the  entities  which  we
encounter  in  concern  are  proximally  hidden.  When  one  designates  Things

as  the  entities  that  are  ‘proximally  given’,  one  goes  ontologically  astray,
even though ontically one has something else in mind. What one really has
in  mind  remains  undetermined.  But  suppose  one  characterizes  these
‘Things’  as  Things  ‘invested  with  value’?  What  does  “value”  mean
ontologically?  How  are  we  to  categorize  this  ‘investing’  and  Being-
invested?  Disregarding  the  obscurity  of  this  structure  of  investiture  with
value,  have  we  thus  met  that  phenomenal  characteristic  of  Being  which
belongs to what we encounter in our concernful dealings?

The Greeks had an appropriate term  for  ‘Things’: πράγματα—that is  to
say, that which one has to do with in one’s concernful dealings (πρᾶξις). But
ontologically, the specifically ‘pragmatic’ character of the πράγματα is  just
what  the  Greeks  left  in  obscurity;  they  thought  of  these  ‘proximally’  as
‘mere Things’. We shall call those entities which we encounter in concern
“equipment”.(1)  In  our  dealings  we  come  across  equipment  for  writing,
sewing,  working,  transportation,  measurement.  The  kind  of  Being  which
equipment possesses must be exhibited. The clue for doing this lies in our
first  defining  what  makes  an 
its
equipmentality.

item  of  equipment—namely, 

Taken strictly, there ‘is’ no such thing as an equipment. To the Being of
any equipment there always belongs a totality of equipment, in which it can
be  this  equipment  that  it  is.  Equipment  is  essentially  ‘something  in-order-
to...’  [“etwas  um-zu...”].  A  totality  of  equipment  is  constituted  by  various
ways  of  the  ‘in-order-to’,  such  as  serviceability,  conduciveness,  usability,
manipulability.

In the ‘in-order-to’ as a structure there lies an assignment or reference of
something  to  something.(2)  Only  in  the  analyses  which  are  to  follow  can
the phenomenon which this term ‘assignment’ indicates be made visible in
its  ontological  genesis.  Provisionally,  it  is  enough  to  take  a  look
phenomenally  at  a  manifold  of  such  assignments.  Equipment—in
accordance  with  its  equipmentality—always  is  in  terms  of  [aus]  its
belonging to other equipment: ink-stand, pen, ink, paper, blotting pad, table,
lamp,  furniture,  windows,  doors,  room.  These  ‘Things’  never  show
themselves proximally as they are for themselves, so as to add up to a sum
of realia and fill up a room. What we encounter as closest to us (though not
as  something  taken  as  a  theme)  is  the  room;  and  we  encounter  it  not  as
something  ‘between  four  walls’  in  a  geometrical  spatial  sense,  but  as
equipment for residing. Out of this the ‘arrangement’ emerges, and it is in

this that any ‘individual’ item of equipment shows itself. Before it does so,
a totality of equipment has already been discovered.
 

1.  ‘das  Zeug’.  The  word  ‘Zeug’  has  no  precise  English  equivalent.  While  it  may  mean  any
implement,  instrument,  or  tool,  Heidegger  uses  it  for  the  most  part  as  a  collective  noun  which  is
analogous  to  our  relatively  specific  ‘gear’  (as  in  ‘gear  for  fishing’)  or  the  more  elaborate
‘paraphernalia’,  or  the  still  more  general  ‘equipment’,  which  we  shall  employ  throughout  this
translation. In this collective sense ‘Zeug’ can sometimes be used in a way which is comparable to
the use of ‘stuff’ in such sentences as ‘there is plenty of stuff lying around’. (See H. 74.) In general,
however,  this  pejorative  connotation  is  lacking.  For  the  most  part  Heidegger  uses  the  term  as  a
collective noun, so that he can say that there is no such thing as ‘an equipment’; but he still uses it
occasionally with an indefinite article to refer to some specific tool or instrument—some item or bit
of equipment.

2.  ‘In  der  Struktur  “Um-zu”  liegt  eine  Verweisung  von  etwas  auf  etwas.’  There  is  no  close
English  equivalent  for  the  word  ‘Verweisung’,  which  occurs  many  times  in  this  chapter.  The  basic
metaphor seems to be that of turning something away towards something else, or pointing it away, as
when one ‘refers’ or ‘commits’ or ‘relegates’ or ‘assigns’ something to something else, whether one
‘refers’ a symbol to what it symbolizes, ‘refers’ a beggar to a welfare agency, ‘commits’ a person for
trial, ‘relegates’ or ‘banishes’ him to Siberia, or even ‘assigns’ equipment to a purpose for which it is
to  be  used.  ‘Verweisung’  thus  does  some  of  the  work  of  ‘reference’,  ‘commitment’,  ‘assignment’,
‘relegation’,  ‘banishment’;  but  it  does  not  do  all  the  work  of  any  of  these  expressions.  For  a
businessman to ‘refer’ to a letter, for a symbol to ‘refer’ to what it symbolizes, for a man to ‘commit
larceny or murder’ or merely to ‘commit himself’ to certain partisan views, for a teacher to give a
pupil  a  long  ‘assignment’,  or  even  for  a  journalist  to  receive  an  ‘assignment’  to  the  Vatican,  we
would have to find some other verb than ‘verweisen’. We shall, however, use the verbs ‘assign’ and
‘refer’ and their derivatives as perhaps the least misleading substitutes, employing whichever seems
the more appropriate in the context, and occasionally using a hendiadys as in the present passage. See
Section 17 for further discussion. (When other words such as ‘anweisen’ or ‘zuweisen’ are translated
as ‘assign’, we shall usually subjoin the German in brackets.)

H. 69

 

Equipment  can  genuinely  show  itself  only  in  dealings  cut  to  its  own
measure (hammering with a hammer, for example); but in such dealings an
entity of this kind is not grasped thematically as an occurring Thing, nor is
the equipment-structure known as such even in the using. The hammering
does  not  simply  have  knowledge  about  [um]  the  hammer’s  character  as
equipment, but it has appropriated this equipment in a way which could not
possibly be more suitable. In dealings such as this, where something is put
to  use,  our  concern  subordinates  itself  to  the  “in-order-to”  which  is
constitutive for the equipment we are employing at the time; the less we just
stare at the hammer-Thing, and the more we seize hold of it and use it, the
more primordial does our relationship to it become, and the more unveiledly
is  it  encountered  as  that  which  it  is—as  equipment.  The  hammering  itself

uncovers the specific ‘manipulability’ [“Handlichkeit”] of the hammer. The
kind  of  Being  which  equipment  possesses—in  which  it  manifests  itself  in
its  own  right—we  call  “readiness-to-hand”  [Zuhandenheit].(1)  Only
because equipment has this ‘Being-in-itself’ and does not merely occur, is it
manipulable  in  the  broadest  sense  and  at  our  disposal.  No  matter  how
sharply  we  just  look  [Nur-noch-hinsehen]  at  the  ‘outward  appearance’
[“Aussehen]”  of  Things  in  whatever  form  this  takes,  we  cannot  discover
anything ready-to-hand. If we look at Things just ‘theoretically’, we can get
along  without  understanding  readiness-to-hand.  But  when  we  deal  with
them by using them and manipulating them, this activity is not a blind one;
it has its own kind of sight, by which our manipulation is guided and from
which  it  acquires  its  specific  Thingly  character.  Dealings  with  equipment
subordinate  themselves  to  the  manifold  assignments  of  the  ‘in-order-to’.

1. Italics only in earlier editions.
2. The word ‘Umsicht’, which we translate by ‘circumspection’, is here presented as standing for
a special kind of ‘Sicht’ (‘sight’). Here, as elsewhere, Heidegger is taking advantage of the fact that
the prefix ‘um’ may mean either ‘around’ or ‘in order to’. ‘Umsicht’ may accordingly be thought of
as meaning ‘looking around’ or ‘looking around for something’ or ‘looking around for a way to get
something done’. In ordinary German usage, ‘Umsicht’ seems to have much the same connotation as
our ‘circumspection’—a kind of awareness in which one looks around before one decides just what
one ought to do next. But Heidegger seems to be generalizing this notion as well as calling attention
to  the  extent  to  which  circumspection  in  the  narrower  sense  occurs  in  our  every-day  living.  (The
distinction between ‘sight’ (Sicht’) and ‘seeing’ (‘Sehen’) will be developed further in Sections 31
and 36 below.)

‘Practical’ behaviour is not ‘atheoretical’ in the sense of “sightlessness”.
(1) The way it differs from theoretical behaviour does not lie simply in the
fact that in theoretical behaviour one observes, while in practical behaviour
one  acts  [gehandelt  wird],  and  that  action  must  employ  theoretical
cognition if it is not to remain blind; for the fact that observation is a kind of
concern is just as primordial as the fact that action has its own kind of sight.
Theoretical behaviour is just looking, without circumspection. But the fact
that  this  looking  is  non-circumspective  does  not  mean  that  it  follows  no
rules: it constructs a canon for itself in the form of method.

The  ready-to-hand  is  not  grasped  theoretically  at  all,  nor  is  it  itself  the
sort  of  thing  that  circumspection  takes  proximally  as  a  circumspective
theme.  The  peculiarity  of  what  is  proximally  ready-to-hand  is  that,  in  its

readiness-to-hand,  it  must,  as  it  were,  withdraw  [zurückzuziehen]  in  order
to  be  ready-to-hand  quite  authentically.  That  with  which  our  everyday
dealings  proximally  dwell  is  not  the  tools  themselves  [die  Werkzeuge
selbst]. On the contrary, that with which we concern ourselves primarily is
the work—that which is to be produced at the time; and this is accordingly
ready-to-hand  too.  The  work  bears  with  it  that  referential  totality  within
which the equipment is encountered.(2)
 

1.  ‘…im  Sinne  der  Sichtlosigkeit...’  The  point  of  this  sentence  will  be  clear  to  the  reader  who
recalls that the Greek verb θεωρεῖν, from which the words ‘theoretical’ and ‘atheoretical’ are derived,
originally  meant  ‘to  see’.  Heidegger  is  pointing  out  that  this  is  not  what  we  have  in  mind  in  the
traditional contrast between the ‘theoretical’ and the ‘practical’.

2. ‘Das Werk trägt die Verweisungsganzheit, innerhalb derer das Zeug begegnet.’ In this chapter
the word ‘Werk’ (‘work’) usually refers to the product achieved by working rather than to the process
of working as such. We shall as a rule translate ‘Verweisungsganzheit’ as ‘referential totality’, though
sometimes  the  clumsier  ‘totality  of  assignments’  may  convey  the  idea  more  effectively.  (The  older
editions read ‘deren’ rather than ‘derer’.)

H. 70

 

The work to be produced, as the “towards-which” of such things as the
hammer,  the  plane,  and  the  needle,  likewise  has  the  kind  of  Being  that
belongs  to  equipment.  The  shoe  which  is  to  be  produced  is  for  wearing
(footgear) [Schuhzeug]; the clock is manufactured for telling the time. The
work which we chiefly encounter in our concernful dealings—the work that
is  to  be  found  when  one  is  “at  work”  on  something  [das  in  Arbeit
befindliche]—has  a  usability  which  belongs  to  it  essentially;  in  this
usability  it  lets  us  encounter  already  the  “towards-which”  for  which  it  is
usable. A work that someone has ordered [das bestellte Werk]  i s  only  by
reason of its use and the assignment-context of entities which is discovered
in using it.

But  the  work  to  be  produced  is  not  merely  usable  for  something.  The
production itself is a using of something for something. In the work there is
also  a  reference  or  assignment  to  ‘materials’:  the  work  is  dependent  on
[angewiesen auf] leather, thread, needles, and the like. Leather, moreover is
produced  from  hides.  These  are  taken  from  animals,  which  someone  else
has raised. Animals also occur within the world without having been raised
at all; and, in a way, these entities still produce themselves even when they
have been raised. So in the environment certain entities become accessible

which  are  always  ready-to-hand,  but  which,  in  themselves,  do  not  need  to
be produced. Hammer, tongs, and needle, refer in themselves to steel, iron,
metal,  mineral,  wood,  in  that  they  consist  of  these.  In  equipment  that  is
used, ‘Nature’ is discovered along with it by that use—the ‘Nature’ we find
in natural products.

Here,  however,  “Nature”  is  not  to  be  understood  as  that  which  is  just
present-at-hand, nor as the power of Nature. The wood is a forest of timber,
the mountain a quarry of rock; the river is water-power, the wind is wind ‘in
the sails’. As the ‘environment’ is discovered, the ‘Nature’ thus discovered
is encountered too. If its kind of Being as ready-to-hand is disregarded, this
‘Nature’ itself can be discovered and defined simply in its pure presence-at-
hand.  But  when  this  happens,  the  Nature  which  ‘stirs  and  strives’,  which
assails  us  and  enthralls  us  as  landscape,  remains  hidden.  The  botanist’s
plants  are  not  the  flowers  of  the  hedgerow;  the  ‘source’  which  the
geographer establishes for a river is not the ‘springhead in the dale’.

The  work  produced  refers  not  only  to  the  “towards-which”  of  its
usability  and  the  “whereof”  of  which  it  consists:  under  simple  craft
conditions it also has an assignment to the person who is to use it or wear it.
The  work  is  cut  to  his  figure;  he  ‘is’  there  along  with  it  as  the  work
emerges.  Even  when  goods  are  produced  by  the  dozen,  this  constitutive
assignment is by no means lacking; it is merely indefinite, and points to the
random,  the  average.  Thus  along  with  the  work,  we  encounter  not  only
entities  ready-to-hand  but  also  entities  with  Dasein’s  kind  of  Being—
entities for which, in their concern, the product becomes ready-to-hand; and
together with these we encounter the world in which wearers and users live,
which is at the same time ours. Any work with which one concerns oneself
is ready-to-hand not only in the domestic world of the workshop but also in
the public  world. Along  with  the  public  world,  the environing  Nature  [die
Umweltnatur] is discovered and is accessible to everyone. In roads, streets,
bridges,  buildings,  our  concern  discovers  Nature  as  having  some  definite
direction.  A  covered  railway  platform  takes  account  of  bad  weather;  an
installation  for  public  lighting  takes  account  of  the  darkness,  or  rather  of
specific changes in the presence or absence of daylight—the ‘position of the
sun’.  In  a  clock,  account  is  taken  of  some  definite  constellation  in  the

world-system. When we look at the clock, we tacitly make use of the ‘sun’s
position’, in accordance with which the measurement of time gets regulated
in  the  official  astronomical  manner.  When  we  make  use  of  the  clock-
equipment,  which  is  proximally  and  inconspicuously  ready-to-hand,  the
environing Nature is ready-to-hand along with it. Our concernful absorption
in whatever work-world lies closest to us, has a function of discovering; and
it is essential to this function that, depending upon the way in which we are
absorbed, 
those  entities  within-the-world  which  are  brought  along
[beigebrachte] in the work and with it (that is to say, in the assignments or
references  which  are  constitutive  for  it)  remain  discoverable  in  varying
degrees of explicitness and with a varying circumspective penetration.

The kind of Being which belongs to these entities is readiness-to-hand.
But  this  characteristic  is  not  to  be  understood  as  merely  a  way  of  taking
them,  as  if  we  were  talking  such  ‘aspects’  into  the  ‘entities’  which  we
proximally  encounter,  or  as  if  some  world-stuff  which  is  proximally
present-at-hand  in  itself(1)  were  ‘given  subjective  colouring’  in  this  way.
Such an Interpretation would overlook the fact that in this case these entities
would  have  to  be  understood  and  discovered  beforehand  as  something
purely  present-at-hand,  and  must  have  priority  and  take  the  lead  in  the
sequence  of  those  dealings  with  the  ‘world’  in  which  something  is
discovered  and  made  one’s  own.  But  this  already  runs  counter  to  the
ontological  meaning  of  cognition,  which  we  have  exhibited  as  a  founded
mode of Being-in-the-world.(2) To lay bare what is just present-at-hand and
no more, cognition must first penetrate beyond what is ready-to-hand in our
concern.  Readiness-to-hand  is  the  way  in  which  entities  as  they  are  ‘in
themselves’  are  defined  ontologico-categorially.  Yet  only  by  reason  of
something  present-at-hand,  ‘is  there’  anything  ready-to-hand.  Does  it
follow, however, granting this thesis for the nonce, that readiness-to-hand is
ontologically founded upon presence-at-hand?

sich vorhandener Weltstoff...’

H. 72

 

But even if, as our ontological Interpretation proceeds further, readiness-
to-hand  should  prove  itself  to  be  the  kind  of  Being  characteristic  of  those

entities  which  are  proximally  discovered  within-the-world,  and  even  if  its
primordiality as compared with pure presence-at-hand can be demonstrated,
have all these explications been of the slightest help towards understanding
the  phenomenon  of  the  world  ontologically?  In  Interpreting  these  entities
within-the-world, however, we have always ‘presupposed’ the world. Even
if  we  join  them  together,  we  still  do  not  get  anything  like  the  ‘world’  as
their  sum.  If,  then,  we  start  with  the  Being  of  these  entities,  is  there  any
avenue that will lead us to exhibiting the phenomenon of the world?(i)
 

i. The author may remark that this analysis of the environment and in general the ‘hermeneutic of
the facticity’ of Dasein, have been presented repeatedly in his lectures since the winter semester of
1919—1920.

16. How the Worldly Character of the Environment Announces itself

in Entities Within-the-world
 

1. ‘Die am innerweltlich Seienden sich meldende Weltmässigkeit der Umwelt.’

The  world  itself  is  not  an  entity  within-the-world;  and  yet  it  is  so
determinative for such entities that only in so far as ‘there is’ a world can
they be encountered and show themselves, in their Being, as entities which
have  been  discovered.  But  in  what  way  ‘is  there’  a  world?  If  Dasein  is
ontically constituted by Being-in-the-World, and if an understanding of the
Being  of  its  Self  belongs  just  as  essentially  to  its  Being,  no  matter  how
indefinite  that  understanding  may  be,  then  does  not  Dasein  have  an
understanding of the world—a pre-ontological understanding, which indeed
can  and  does  get  along  without  explicit  ontological  insights?  With  those
entities  which  are  encountered  within-the-world—that  is  to  say,  with  their
character  as  within-the-world—does  not  something  like  the  world  show
itself  for  concernful  Being-in-the-world?  Do  we  not  have  a  pre-
phenomenological  glimpse  of  this  phenomenon?  Do  we  not  always  have
such  a  glimpse  of  it,  without  having  to  take  it  as  a  theme  for  ontological
Interpretation? Has Dasein itself, in the range of its concernful absorption in
equipment ready-to-hand, a possibility of Being in which the worldhood of
those  entities  within-the-world  with  which  it  is  concerned  is,  in  a  certain
way, lit up for it, along with those entities themselves?

If  such  possibilities  of  Being  for  Dasein  can  be  exhibited  within  its
concernful  dealings,  then  the  way  lies  open  for  studying  the  phenomenon
which is thus lit up, and for attempting to ‘hold it at bay’, as it were, and to
interrogate it as to those structures which show themselves therein.

H. 73

 

To the everydayness of Being-in-the-world there belong certain modes of
concern.  These  permit  the  entities  with  which  we  concern  ourselves  to  be
encountered in such a way that the worldly character of what is within-the-
world  comes  to  the  fore.  When  we  concern  ourselves  with  something,  the
entities  which  are  most  closely  ready-to-hand  may  be  met  as  something
unusable, not properly adapted for the use we have decided upon. The tool
turns out to be damaged, or the material unsuitable. In each of these cases
equipment is here, ready-to-hand. We discover its unusability, however, not
by  looking  at  it  and  establishing  its  properties,  but  rather  by  the
circumspection of the dealings in which we use it. When its unusability is
thus  discovered,  equipment  becomes  conspicuous.  This  conspicuousness
presents the ready-to-hand equipment as in a certain un-readiness-to-hand.
But this implies that what cannot be used just lies there; it shows itself as an
equipmental  Thing  which  looks  so  and  so,  and  which,  in  it  readiness-to-
hand  as  looking  that  way,  has  constantly  been  present-at-hand  too.  Pure
presence-at-hand announces itself in such equipment, but only to withdraw
to  the  readiness-to-hand  of  something  with  which  one  concerns  oneself—
that is to say, of the sort of thing we find when we put it back into repair.
This presence-at-hand of something that cannot be used is still not devoid of
all  readiness-to-hand  whatsoever;  equipment  which  is  present-at-hand  in
this way is  still  not  just  a  Thing  which  occurs  somewhere.  The  damage  to
the  equipment  is  still  not  a  mere  alteration  of  a  Thing—not  a  change  of
properties which just occurs in something present-at-hand.

In  our  concernful  dealings,  however,  we  not  only  come  up  against
unusable  things  within what  is  ready-to-hand  already:  we  also  find  things
which are missing—which not only are not ‘handy’ [“handlich”] but are not
‘to hand’ [“zur Hand”] at all. Again, to miss something in this way amounts
to coming across something un-ready-to-hand. When we notice what is un-
ready-to-hand,  that  which    i  s    ready-to-hand  enters  the  mode  of
obtrusiveness. The more urgently [Je dringlicher] we need what is missing,

and the more authentically it is encountered in its un-readiness-to-hand, all
the more obtrusive [um so aufdringlicher] does that which is ready-to-hand
become—so  much  so,  indeed,  that  it  seems  to  lose  its  character  of
readiness-to-hand. It reveals itself as something just present-at-hand and no
more,  which  cannot  be  budged  without  the  thing  that  is  missing.  The
helpless way in which we stand before it is a deficient mode of concern, and
as  such 
the  Being-just-present-at-hand-and-no-more  of
it  uncovers 
something ready-to-hand.

H. 74

 

In  our  dealings  with  the  world(1)  of  our  concern,  the  un-ready-to-hand
can be encountered not only in the sense of that which is unusable or simply
missing, but as something un-ready-to-hand which is not missing at all and
not unusable, but which ‘stands in the way’ of our concern. That to which
our concern refuses to turn, that for which it has ‘no time’, is something un-
ready-to-hand in the manner of what does not belong here, of what has not
as yet been attended to. Anything which is un-ready-to-hand in this way is
disturbing to us, and enables us to see the obstinacy of that with which we
must concern ourselves in the first instance before we do anything else.
 

1.  In  the  earlier  editions  ‘Welt’  appears  with  quotation  marks.  These  are  omitted  in  the  later

editions.

With  this  obstinacy,  the  presence-at-hand  of  the  ready-to-hand  makes
itself known in a new way as the Being of that which still lies before us and
calls for our attending to it.(1)

The modes of conspicuousness, obtrusiveness, and obstinacy all have the
function  of  bringing  to  the  fore  the  characteristic  of  presence-at-hand  in
which is ready-to-hand. But the ready-to-hand is not thereby just observed
and  stared  at  as  something  present-at-hand;  the  presence-at-hand  which
makes itself known is still bound up in the readiness-to-hand of equipment.
Such  equipment  still  does  not  veil  itself  in  the  guise  of  mere  Things.  It
becomes  ‘equipment’  in  the  sense  of  something  which  one  would  like  to
shove out of the way.(2) But in such a Tendency to shove things aside, the
ready-to-hand shows itself as still ready-to-hand in its unswerving presence-
at-hand.

 

(Auffälligkeit’), 

‘conspicuousness’ 

1.  Heidegger’s  distinction  between 

‘obtrusiveness’
(‘Aufdringlichkeit’),  and  ‘obstinacy’  (‘Aufsässigkeit’)  is  hard  to  present  unambiguously  in
translation.  He  seems  to  have  in  mind  three  rather  similar  situations.  In  each  of  these  we  are
confronted by a number of articles which are ready-to-hand. In the first situation we wish to use one
of these articles for some purpose, but we find that it cannot be used for that purpose. It then becomes
‘conspicuous’ or ‘striking’, and in a way ‘un-ready-to-hand’—in that we are not able to use it. In the
second  situation  we  may  have  precisely  the  same  articles  before  us,  but  we  want  one  which  is  not
there. In this case the missing article too is ‘un-ready-to-hand’, but in another way—in that it is not
there  to  be  used.  This  is  annoying,  and  the  articles  which  are  still  ready-to-hand  before  us,  thrust
themselves  upon  us  in  such  a  way  that  they  become  ‘obtrusive’  or  even  ‘obnoxious’.  In  the  third
situation, some of the articles which are ready-to-hand before us are experienced as obstacles to the
achievement  of  some  purpose;  as  obstacles  they  are  ‘obstinate’,  ‘recalcitrant’,  ‘refractory’,  and  we
have  to  attend  to  them  or  dispose  of  them  in  some  way  before  we  can  finish  what  we  want  to  do.
Here again the obstinate objects are un-ready-to-hand, but simply in the way of being obstinate.

In all three situations the articles which are ready-to-hand for us tend to lose their readiness-to-
hand in one way or another and reveal their presence-at-hand; only in the second situation, however,
do we encounter them as ‘just present-at-hand and no more’ (‘nur noch Vorhandenes’).
2. Here ‘Zeug’ is used in the pejorative sense of ‘stuff’. See our note 1, H. 68.

Now  that  we  have  suggested,  however,  that  the  ready-to-hand  is  thus
encountered under modifications in which its presence-at-hand is revealed,
how far does this clarify the phenomenon of the world? Even in  analysing
these modifications we have not gone beyond the Being of what is within-
the-world,  and  we  have  come  no  closer  to  the  world-phenomenon  than
before. But though we have not as yet grasped it, we have brought ourselves
to a point where we can bring it into view.

In conspicuousness, obtrusiveness, and obstinacy, that which is ready-to-
hand loses its readiness-to-hand in a certain way. But in our dealings with
what  is  ready-to-hand,  this  readiness-to-hand  is  itself  understood,  though
not thematically. It does not vanish simply, but takes its farewell, as it were,
in the conspicuousness of the unusable. Readiness-to-hand still shows itself,
and  it  is  precisely  here  that  the  worldly  character  of  the  ready-to-hand
shows itself too.

The  structure  of  the  Being  of  what  is  ready-to-hand  as  equipment  is
determined by references or assignments. In a peculiar and obvious manner,
the  ‘Things’  which  are  closest  to  us  are  ‘in  themselves’  [“Ansich”];  and
they are encountered as ‘in themselves’ in the concern which makes use of
them  without  noticing  them  explicitly—the  concern  which  can  come  up
against something unusable. When equipment cannot be used, this implies
that the constitutive assignment of the “in-order-to” to a “towards-this” has
been  disturbed.  The  assignments  themselves  are  not  observed;  they  are

rather ‘there’  when  we  concernfully submit  ourselves to  them [Sichstellen
unter sie]. But when an assignment has been disturbed—when something is
unusable  for  some  purpose—then  the  assignment  becomes  explicit.  Even
now, of course, it has not become explicit as an ontological structure; but it
has  become  explicit  ontically  for  the  circumspection  which  comes  up
against  the  damaging  of  the  tool.  When  an  assignment  to  some  particular
“towards-this”  has  been  thus  circumspectively  aroused,  we  catch  sight  of
the  “towards-this”  itself,  and  along  with  it  everything  connected  with  the
work—the  whole  ‘work-shop’—as  that  wherein  concern  always  dwells.
The context of equipment is lit up, not as something never seen before, but
as  a  totality  constantly  sighted  beforehand  in  circumspection.  With  this
totality, however, the world announces itself.

H. 75

 

Similarly,  when  something  ready-to-hand  is  found  missing,  though  its
everyday  presence [Zugegensein]  has been so obvious  that we  have never
taken any notice of it, this makes a break in those referential contexts which
circumspection discovers. Our circumspection comes up against emptiness,
and now sees for the first time what the missing article was ready-to-hand
with, and what it was ready-to-hand for. The environment announces  itself
afresh. What is thus lit up is not itself just one thing ready-to-hand among
others;  still  less  is  it  something  present-at-hand  upon  which  equipment
ready-to-hand  is  somehow  founded:  it  is  in  the  ‘there’  before  anyone  has
observed or ascertained it. It is itself inaccessible to circumspection, so far
as circumspection is always directed towards entities; but in each case it has
already  been  disclosed  for  circumspection.  ‘Disclose’  and  ‘disclosedness’
will be used as technical terms in the passages that follow, and shall signify
‘to  lay  open’  and  ‘the  character  of  having  been  laid  open.’  Thus  ‘to
disclose’ never means anything like ‘to obtain indirectly by inference’.(1)
 

1. In ordinary German usage, the verb ‘erschliessen’ may mean not only to ‘disclose’ but also—
in certain constructions—to ‘infer’ or ‘conclude’ in the sense in which one ‘infers’ a conclusion from
premisses.  Heidegger  is  deliberately  ruling  out  this  latter  interpretation,  though  on  a  very  few
occasions  he  may  use  the  word  in  this  sense.  He  explains  his  own  meaning  by  the  cognate  verb
‘aufschliessen’,  to  ‘lay  open’.  To  say  that  something  has  been  ‘disclosed’  or  ‘laid  open’  in
Heidegger’s sense, does not mean that one has any detailed awareness of the contents which are thus
‘disclosed’, but rather that they have been ‘laid open’ to us as implicit in what is given, so that they

may be made explicit to our awareness by further analysis or discrimination of the given, rather than
by any inference from it.

That the world does not ‘consist’ of the ready-to-hand shows itself in the
fact  (among  others)  that  whenever  the  world  is  lit  up  in  the  modes  of
concern  which  we  have  been  Interpreting,  the  ready-to-hand  becomes
deprived  of  its  worldhood  so  that  Being-just-present-at-hand  comes  to  the
fore. If, in our everyday concern with the ‘environment’, it is to be possible
for  equipment  ready-to-hand  to  be  encountered  in  its  ‘Being-in-itself’  [in
seinem “An-sich-sein”], then those assignments and referential totalities in
which  our  circumspection  ‘is  absorbed’  cannot  become  a  theme  for  that
circumspection  any  more  than  they  can  for  grasping  things  ‘thematically’
but non-circumspectively. If it is to be possible for the ready-to-hand not to
emerge from its inconspicuousness, the world must not announce itself. And
it is in this that the Being-in-itself of entities which are ready-to-hand has its
phenomenal structure constituted.

H. 76

 

In 

as 

such 

privative 

the  present-at-hand  as 

“inconspicuousness”,
expressions 
“unobtrusiveness”, and “non-obstinacy”, what we have in view is a positive
phenomenal  character  of  the  Being  of  that  which  is  proximally  ready-to-
hand.  With  these  negative  prefixes  we  have  in  view  the  character  of  the
ready-to-hand as “holding itself in”; this is what we have our eye upon in
the “Being-in-itself” of something,(1) though ‘proximally’ we ascribe it to
the  present-at-hand—to 
that  which  can  be
thematically ascertained. As long as we take our orientation primarily and
exclusively  from  the  present-at-hand,  the  ‘in-itself’  can  by  no  means  be
ontologically  clarified.  If,  however,  this  talk  about  the  ‘in-itself’  has  any
ontological  importance,  some  interpretation  must  be  called  for.  This  “in-
itself”  of  Being  is  something  which  gets  invoked  with  considerable
emphasis,  mostly  in  an  ontical  way,  and  rightly  so  from  a  phenomenal
standpoint. But if some ontological assertion is supposed to be given when
this is ontically invoked, its claims are not fulfilled by such a procedure. As
the  foregoing  analysis  has  already  made  clear,  only  on  the  basis  of  the
phenomenon  of  the  world  can  the  Being-in-itself  of  entities  within-the-
world be grasped ontologically.

 

 

1. ‘Diese “Un” meinen den Charakter des Ansichhaltens des Zuhandenen, das, was wir mit dem
An-sieh-sein im Auge haben...’ The point seems to be that when we speak of something ‘as it is “in
itself”  or  “in  its  own  right”  ’,we  think  of  it  as  ‘holding  itself  in’  or  ‘holding  itself  back’—not
‘stepping forth’ or doing something ‘out of character’.

But if the world can, in a way, be lit up, it must assuredly be disclosed.
And  it  has  already  been  disclosed  beforehand  whenever  what  is  ready-to-
hand within-the-world is accessible for circumspective concern. The world
is therefore something ‘wherein’ Dasein as an entity already was, and if in
any manner it explicitly comes away from anything, it can never do more
than come back to the world.

Being-in-the-world, according to our Interpretation hitherto, amounts to
a  non-thematic  circumspective  absorption  in  references  or  assignments
constitutive  for  the  readiness-to-hand  of  a  totality  of  equipment.  Any
concern  is  already  as  it  is,  because  of  some  familiarity  with  the  world.  In
this familiarity Dasein can lose itself in what it encounters within-the-world
and be fascinated with it. What is it that Dasein is familiar with? Why can
the worldly character of what is within-the-world be lit up? The presence-
at-hand(1)  of  entities  is  thrust  to  the  fore  by  the  possible  breaks  in  that
referential totality in which circumspection ‘operates’; how are we to get a
closer understanding of this totality?

These questions are aimed at working out both the phenomenon and the
problems  of  worldhood,  and 
the
interconnections with which certain structures are built up. To answer them
we must analyse these structures more concretely.

they  call  for  an 

inquiry 

into 

17. Reference and Signs

In our provisional Interpretation of that structure of Being which belongs
to  the  ready-to-hand  (to  ‘equipment’),  the  phenomenon  of  reference  or
assignment became visible; but we merely gave an indication of it, and in
so  sketchy  a  form  that  we  at  once  stressed  the  necessity  of  uncovering  it
with  regard  to  its  ontological  origin.(2)  It  became  plain,  moreover,  that
assignments  and  referential  totalities  could  in  some  sense  become
constitutive  for  worldhood  itself.  Hitherto  we  have  seen  the  world  lit  up
only  in  and  for  certain  definite  ways  in  which  we  concern  ourselves

environmentally with the ready-to-hand, and indeed it has been lit up only
with  the  readiness-to-hand  of  that  concern.  So  the  further  we  proceed  in
understanding the Being of entities within-the-world, the broader and firmer
becomes  the  phenomenal  basis  on  which  the  world-phenomenon  may  be
laid bare.

H. 77

 

We shall again take as our point of departure the Being of the ready-to-
hand,  but  this  time  with  the  purpose  of  grasping  the  phenomenon  of
reference or assignment itself more precisely. We shall accordingly attempt
an  ontological  analysis  of  a  kind  of  equipment  in  which  one  may  come
across  such  ‘references’  in  more  senses  than  one.  We  come  across
‘equipment’ in signs. The word “sign” designates many kinds of things: not
only may it stand for different kinds of signs, but Being-a-sign-for can itself
be formalized as a universal kind of relation, so that the sign-structure itself
provides an ontological clue for ‘characterizing’ any entity whatsoever.

But signs, in the first instance, are themselves items of equipment whose
specific  character  as  equipment  consists  in  showing  or  indicating.(1)  We
find  such  signs  in  signposts,  boundary-stones,  the  ball  for  the  mariner’s
storm-warning, signals, banners, signs of mourning, and the like. Indicating
can be defined as a ‘kind’ of referring. Referring is, if we take it as formally
as possible, a relating. But relation does not function as a genus for ‘kinds’
or  ‘species’  of  references  which  may  somehow  become  differentiated  as
sign,  symbol,  expression,  or  signification.  A  relation  is  something  quite
formal which may be read off directly by way of ‘formalization’ from any
kind of context, whatever its subject-matter or its way of Being.(ii)

Every reference is a relation, but not every relation is a reference. Every
‘indication’  is  a  reference,  but  not  every  referring  is  an  indicating.  This
implies at the same time that every ‘indication’ is a relation, but not every
relation is an indicating. The formally general character of relation is thus
brought  to  light.  If  we  are  to  investigate  such  phenomena  as  references,
signs, or even significations, nothing is to be gained by characterizing them
as  relations.  Indeed  we  shall  eventually  have  to  show  that  ‘relations’

themselves,  because  of  their  formally  general  character,  have  their
ontological source in a reference.

10  ff.,  as  well  as  his  Logische  Untersuchungen,  vol.  I,  Ch.  II.  For  the  analysis  of  signs  and
signification see ibid., vol. II, I, Ch. I.
 

1. ‘…deren spezifischer Zeugcharakter im Zeigen besteht.’ While we have often used ‘show’ and
‘indicate’ to translate ‘zeigen’ and ‘anzeigen’ respectively, in the remainder of this section it seems
more  appropriate  to  translate  ‘zeigen’  by  ‘indicate’,  or  to  resort  to  hendiadys  as  in  the  present
passage.

H. 78

 

If the present analysis is to be confined to the Interpretation of the sign
as  distinct  from  the  phenomenon  of  reference,  then  even  within  this
limitation  we  cannot  properly  investigate  the  full  multiplicity  of  possible
signs. Among signs there are symptoms [Anzeichen], warning signals, signs
of  things  that  have  happened  already  [Rückzeichen],  signs  to  mark
something, signs by which things are recognized; these have different ways
of indicating, regardless of what may be serving as such a sign. From such
‘signs’  we  must  distinguish  traces,  residues,  commemorative  monuments,
documents,  testimony,  symbols,  expressions,  appearances,  significations.
These  phenomena  can  easily  be  formalized  because  of  their  formal
relational character; we find it especially tempting nowadays to take such a
‘relation’ as a clue for subjecting every entity to a kind of ‘Interpretation’
which  always  ‘fits’  because  at  bottom  it  says  nothing,  no  more  than  the
facile schema of content and form.

As an example of a sign we have chosen one which we shall use again in
a later analysis, though in another regard. Motor cars are sometimes fitted
up with an adjustable red arrow, whose position indicates the direction the
vehicle will take—at an intersection, for instance. The position of the arrow
is  controlled  by  the  driver.  This  sign  is  an  item  of  equipment  which  is
ready-to-hand  for  the  driver  in  his  concern  with  driving,  and  not  for  him
alone: those who are not travelling with him—and they in particular—also
make use of it, either by giving way on the proper side or by stopping. This
sign  is  ready-to-hand  within-the-world  in  the  whole  equipment-context  of
vehicles  and  traffic  regulations.  It  is  equipment  for  indicating,  and  as

equipment, it is constituted by reference or assignment. It has the character
of  the  “in-order-to”,  its  own  definite  serviceability;  it  is  for  indicating.(1)
This  indicating  which  the  sign  performs  can  be  taken  as  a  kind  of
‘referring’. But here we must notice that this ‘referring’ as indicating is not
the ontological structure of the sign as equipment.
 

1. ‘Es hat den Charakter des Um-zu, seine bestimmte Dienlichkeit, es ist zum Zeigen.’ The verb
‘dienen’, is often followed by an infinitive construction introduced by the preposition ‘zu’. Similarly
the English ‘serve’ can be followed by an infinitive in such expressions as ‘it serves to indicate...’ In
Heidegger’s  German  the  ‘zu’  construction  is  carried  over  to  the  noun  ‘Dienlichkeit’;  the
corresponding noun ‘serviceability’, however, is not normally followed by an infinitive, but rather by
an expression introduced by ‘for’ e.g. ‘serviceability for indicating...’ Since the preposition ‘zu’ plays
an important role in this section and the next, it would be desirable to provide a uniform translation
for  it.  We  shall,  however,  translate  it  as  ‘for’  in  such  expressions  as  ‘Dienlichkeit  zu’,  but  as
‘towards’ in such expressions as ‘Wozu’ (‘towards-which’) and ‘Dazu’ (‘towards-this’), retaining ‘in-
order-to’ for ‘Um-zu’.

H. 79

 

Instead,  ‘referring’  as  indicating  is  grounded  in  the  Being-structure  of
equipment,  in  serviceability  for...  But  an  entity  may  have  serviceability
without  thereby  becoming  a  sign.  As  equipment,  a  ‘hammer’  too  is
constituted by a serviceability, but this does not make it a sign. Indicating,
as a ‘reference’, is a way in which the “towards-which” of a serviceability
becomes  ontically  concrete;  it  determines  an  item  of  equipment  as    f  o  r
  this  “towards-which”  [und  bestimmt  ein  Zeug  zu  diesem].  On  the  other
hand, the kind of reference we get in ‘serviceability-for’, is an ontologico-
categorial  attribute  of  equipment  as  equipment.  That  the  “towards-which”
of serviceability should acquire its concreteness in indicating, is an accident
of  its  equipment-constitution  as  such.  In  this  example  of  a  sign,  the
difference  between  the  reference  of  serviceability  and  the  reference  of
indicating  becomes  visible  in  a  rough  and  ready  fashion.  These  are  so  far
from coinciding that only when they are united does the concreteness of a
definite  kind  of  equipment  become  possible.  Now  it  is  certain  that
indicating  differs  in  principle  from  reference  as  a  constitutive  state  of
equipment; it is just as incontestable that the sign in its turn is related in a
peculiar  and  even  distinctive  way  to  the  kind  of  Being  which  belongs  to
whatever  equipmental  totality  may  be  ready-to-hand  in  the  environment,
and  to  its  worldly  character.  In  our  concernful  dealings,  equipment  for
indicating  [Zeig-zeug]  gets  used  in  a  very  special  way.  But  simply  to

establish this Fact is ontologically insufficient. The basis and the meaning
of this special status must be clarified.

What do we mean when we say that a sign “indicates”? We can answer
this only by determining what kind of dealing is appropriate with equipment
for indicating. And we must do this in such a way that the readiness-to-hand
of that equipment can be genuinely grasped. What is the appropriate way of
having-to-do with signs? Going back to our example of the arrow, we must
say  that  the  kind  of  behaving  (Being)  which  corresponds  to  the  sign  we
encounter, is either to ‘give way’ or to ‘stand still’ vis-à-vis the car with the
arrow.  Giving  way,  as  taking  a  direction,  belongs  essentially  to  Dasein’s
Being-in-the-world. Dasein is always somehow directed [ausgerichtet] and
on its way; standing and waiting are only limiting cases of this directional
‘on-its-way’.  The  sign  addresses  itself  to  a  Being-in-the-world  which  is
specifically  ‘spatial’.  The  sign  is  not  authentically  ‘grasped’  [“erfasst”]  if
we just stare at it and identify it as an indicator-Thing which occurs. Even if
we turn our glance in the direction which the arrow indicates, and look at
something present-at-hand in the region indicated, even then the sign is not
the
authentically  encountered.  Such  a 
circumspection of our concernful dealings, and it does so in such a way that
the  circumspection  which  goes  along  with  it,  following  where  it  points,
brings into an explicit ‘survey’ whatever aroundness the environment may
have at  the  time. This  circumspective  survey  does not grasp  the  ready-to-
hand;  what  it  achieves  is  rather  an  orientation  within  our  environment.
There is also another way in which we can experience equipment: we may
encounter the arrow simply as equipment which belongs to the car. We can
do this without discovering what character it specifically has as equipment:
what the arrow is to indicate and how it is to do so, may remain completely
undetermined;  yet  what  we  are  encountering  is  not  a  mere  Thing.  The
experiencing  of  a  Thing  requires  a  definiteness  of  its  own  [ihre  eigene
Bestimmtheit],  and  must  be  contrasted  with  coming  across  a  manifold  of
equipment,  which  may  often  be  quite  indefinite,  even  when  one  comes
across it as especially close.

Signs  of  the  kind  we  have  described  let  what  is  ready-to-hand  be
encountered; more precisely, they let some context of it become accessible

in such a way that our concernful dealings take on an orientation and hold it
secure.  A  sign  is  not  a  Thing  which  stands  to  another  Thing  in  the
relationship of indicating; it is rather an item of equipment which explicitly
raises a totality of equipment into our circumspection so that together with
it  the  worldly  character  of  the  ready-to-hand  announces  itself.  In  a
symptom or a warning-signal, ‘what is coming’ ‘indicates itself’, but not in
the  sense  of  something  merely  occurring,  which  comes  as  an  addition  to
what is already present-at-hand; ‘what is coming’ is the sort of thing which
we are ready for, or which we ‘weren’t ready for’ if we have been attending
to something else.(1) In signs of something that has happened already, what
has come to pass and run its course becomes circumspectively accessible. A
sign to mark something indicates what one is ‘at’ at any time. Signs always
indicate  primarily  ‘wherein’  one  lives,  where  one’s  concern  dwells,  what
sort of involvement there is with something.(2)

The peculiar character of signs as equipment becomes especially clear in
‘establishing  a  sign’  [“Zeichenstiftung”].  This  activity  is  performed  in  a
circumspective  fore-sight  [Vorsicht]  out  of  which  it  arises,  and  which
requires  that  it  be  possible  for  one’s  particular  environment  to  announce
itself for circumspection at any time by means of something ready-to-hand,
and  that  this  possibility  should  itself  be  ready-to-hand.  But  the  Being  of
what is most closely ready-to-hand within-the-world possesses the character
of  holding-itself-in  and  not  emerging,  which  we  have  described  above.(3)
Accordingly our circumspective  dealings  in  the  environment require some
equipment ready-to-hand which in its character as equipment takes over the
‘work’  of  letting  something  ready-to-hand  become  conspicuous.  So  when
such equipment (signs) gets produced, its conspicuousness must be kept in
mind. But even when signs are thus conspicuous, one does not let them be
present-at-hand  at  random;  they  get  ‘set  up’  [“angebracht”]  in  a  definite
way with a view towards easy accessibility.
 

1. ‘…das “was kommt” ist solches, darauf wir uns gefasst machen, bzw. “nicht gefasst waren”,

sofern wir uns mit anderem befassten.’

2.  ‘Das  Merkzeichen  zeigt,  “woran”  man  jeweils  ist.  Die  Zeichen  zeigen  prirmär  immer  das,
“worin”  man  lebt,  wobei  das  Besorgen  sich  aufhält,  welche  Bewandtnis  es  damit  hat.’  On
‘Bewandtnis’, see note 2, H. 84 below.

3. See H. 75-76 above.

In establishing a sign, however, one does not necessarily have to produce
equipment which is not yet ready-to-hand at all. Signs also arise when one

takes  as  a  sign  [Zum-Zeichen-nehmen]  something  that  is  ready-to-hand
already. In this mode, signs “get established” in a sense which is even more
primordial. In indicating, a ready-to-hand equipment totality, and even the
environment  in  general,  can  be  provided  with  an  availability  which  is
circumspectively oriented; and not only this: establishing a sign can, above
all,  reveal.  What  gets  taken  as  a  sign  becomes  accessible  only  through  its
readiness-to-hand. If, for instance, the south wind ‘is accepted’ [“gilt”] by
the  farmer  as  a  sign  of  rain,  then  this  ‘acceptance’  [“Geltung”]—or  the
‘value’ with which the entity is ‘invested’—is not a sort of bonus over and
above  what  is  already  present-at-hand  in  itself—viz,  the  flow  of  air  in  a
definite  geographical  direction.  The  south  wind  may  be  meteorologically
accessible  as  something  which  just  occurs;  but  it  is  never  present-at-hand
proximally in such a way as this, only occasionally taking over the function
of a warning signal. On the contrary, only by the circumspection with which
one takes account of things in farming, is the south wind discovered in its
Being.

H. 81

 

But,  one  will  protest,  that  which  gets  taken  as  a  sign  must  first  have
become  accessible  in  itself  and  been  apprehended  before  the  sign  gets
established. Certainly it must in any case be such that in some way we can
come  across  it.  The  question  simply  remains  as  to  how  entities  are
discovered  in  this  previous  encountering,  whether  as  mere  Things  which
occur, or rather as equipment which has not been understood—as something
ready-to-hand with which we have hitherto not known ‘how to begin’, and
the  purview  of
which  has  accordingly  kept 
circumspection.  And  here  again,  when  the  equipmental  characters  of  the
ready-to-hand  are  still  circumspectively  undiscovered,  they  are  not  to  be
Interpreted as bare Thinghood presented for an apprehension of what is just
present-at-hand and no more.

itself  veiled 

from 

The  Being-ready-to-hand  of  signs  in  our  everyday  dealings,  and  the
conspicuousness  which  belongs  to  signs  and  which  may  be  produced  for
various purposes and in various ways, do not merely serve to document the
inconspicuousness constitutive for what is most closely ready-to-hand; the
sign  itself  gets  its  conspicuousness  from  the  inconspicuousness  of  the

everydayness.  The  knot  which  one  ties  in  a  handkerchief  [der  bekannte
“Knopf im Taschentuch”] as a sign to mark something is an example of this.
What such a sign is to indicate is always something with which one has to
concern oneself in one’s everyday circumspection. Such a sign can indicate
many things, and things of the most various kinds. The wider the extent to
which it can indicate, the narrower its intelligibility and its usefulness. Not
only is it, for the most part, ready-to-hand as a sign only for the person who
‘establishes’ it, but it can even become inaccessible to him, so that another
sign is needed if the first is to be used circumspectively at all. So when the
knot  cannot  be  used  as  a  sign,  it  does  not  lose  its  sign-character,  but  it
acquires  the  disturbing  obtrusiveness  of  something  most  closely  ready-to-
hand.

H. 82

 

One  might  be  tempted  to  cite  the  abundant  use  of  ‘signs’  in  primitive
Dasein,  as  in  fetishism  and  magic,  to  illustrate  the  remarkable  role  which
they  play  in  everyday  concern  when  it  comes  to  our  understanding  of  the
world.  Certainly  the  establishment  of  signs  which  underlies  this  way  of
using  them  is  not  performed  with  any  theoretical  aim  or  in  the  course  of
theoretical speculation. This way of using them always remains completely
within a Being-in-the-world which is ‘immediate’. But on closer inspection
it  becomes  plain  that  to  interpret  fetishism  and  magic  by  taking  our  clue
from  the  idea  of  signs  in  general,  is  not  enough  to  enable  us  to  grasp  the
kind of ‘Being-ready-to-hand’ which belongs to entities encountered in the
primitive  world.  With  regard  to  the  sign-phenomenon,  the  following
Interpretation may be given: for primitive man, the sign coincides with that
which  is  indicated.  Not  only  can  the  sign  represent  this  in  the  sense  of
serving as a substitute for what it indicates, but it can do so in such a way
that the  sign  itself always is  what  it  indicates.  This  remarkable  coinciding
does  not  mean,  however,  that  the  sign-Thing  has  already  undergone  a
certain ‘Objectification’—that it has been experienced as a mere Thing and
misplaced  into  the  same  realm  of  Being  of  the  present-at-hand  as  what  it
indicates.  This  ‘coinciding’  is  not  an  identification  of  things  which  have
hitherto been isolated from each other: it consists rather in the fact that the
sign has not as yet become free from that of which it is a sign. Such a use of
signs  is  still  absorbed  completely  in  Being-towards  what  is  indicated,  so

that a sign as such cannot detach itself at all. This coinciding is based not on
a  prior  Objectification  but  on  the  fact  that  such  Objectification  is
completely lacking. This means, however, that signs are not discovered as
equipment at all—that ultimately what is ‘ready-to-hand’ within-the-world
just  does  not  have  the  kind  of  Being  that  belongs  to  equipment.  Perhaps
even  readiness-to-hand  and  equipment  have  nothing  to  contribute  [nichts
auszurichten]  as  ontological  clues  in  Interpreting  the  primitive  world;  and
certainly the ontology of Thinghood does even less. But if an understanding
of Being is constitutive for primitive Dasein and for the primitive world in
general,  then  it  is  all  the  more  urgent  to  work  out  the  ‘formal’  idea  of
worldhood—or at least the idea of a phenomenon modifiable in such a way
that  all  ontological  assertions  to  the  effect  that  in  a  given  phenomenal
context  something  is  not  yet  such-and-such  or  no  longer  such-and-such,
may acquire a positive phenomenal meaning in terms of what it is not.(1)
 

1. ‘…aus dem, was es nicht ist.’ The older editions write ‘w a s’ for ‘was’.

The  foregoing  Interpretation  of  the  sign  should  merely  provide
phenomenal  support  for  our  characterization  of  references  or  assignments.
The relation between sign and reference is threefold. 1. Indicating, as a way
whereby  the  “towards-which”  of  a  serviceability  can  become  concrete,  is
founded  upon  the  equipment-structure  as  such,  upon  the  “in-order-to”
(assignment).  2.  The  indicating  which  the  sign  does  is  an  equipmental
character of something ready-to-hand, and as such it belongs to a totality of
equipment, to a context of assignments or references. 3. The sign is not only
ready-to-hand  with  other  equipment,  but  in  its  readiness-to-hand  the
environment becomes in each case explicitly accessible for circumspection.
A  sign  is  something  ontically  ready-to-hand,  which  functions  both  as  this
definite  equipment  and  as  something  indicative  of  [was…  anzeigt]  the
ontological  structure  of  readiness-to-hand,  of  referential  totalities,  and  of
worldhood. Here is rooted the special status of the sign as something ready-
to-hand 
that  environment  with  which  we  concern  ourselves
circumspectively.  Thus  the  reference  or  the  assignment  itself  cannot  be
conceived  as  a  sign  if  it  is  to  serve  ontologically  as  the  foundation  upon
which  signs  are  based.  Reference  is  not  an  ontical  characteristic  of
something ready-to-hand, when it is rather that by which readiness-to-hand
itself is constituted.

in 

In  what  sense,  then,  is  reference  ‘presupposed’  ontologically  in  the
ready-to-hand, and to what extent is it, as such an ontological foundation, at
the same time constitutive for worldhood in general?

18. Involvement and Significance; the Worldhood of the World

The  ready-to-hand  is  encountered  within-the-world.  The  Being  of  this
entity,  readiness-to-hand,  thus  stands  in  some  ontological  relationship
towards  the  world  and  towards  worldhood.  In  anything  ready-to-hand  the
world  is  always  ‘there’.  Whenever  we  encounter  anything,  the  world  has
already been previously discovered, though not thematically. But it can also
be lit up in certain ways of dealing with our environment. The world is that
in terms of which the ready-to-hand is ready-to-hand. How can the world let
the  ready-to-hand  be  encountered?  Our  analysis  hitherto  has  shown  that
what  we  encounter  within-the-world  has,  in  its  very  Being,  been  freed(1)
for  our  concernful  circumspection,  for  taking  account.  What  does  this
previous  freeing  amount  to,  and  how  is  this  to  be  understood  as  an
ontologically  distinctive  feature  of  the  world?  What  problems  does  the
question of the worldhood of the world lay before us?
 

1. ‘freigegeben’. The idea seems to be that what we encounter has, as it were, been released, set

free, given its freedom, or given free rein, so that our circumspection can take account of it.

We  have  indicated  that  the  state  which  is  constitutive  for  the  ready-to-
hand as equipment is one of reference or assignment. How can entities with
this kind of Being be freed by the world with regard to their Being? Why
are these the first entities to be encountered? As definite kinds of references
we  have  mentioned  serviceability-for-,  detrimentality  [Abträglichkeit],
usability, and the like. The “towards-which” [das Wozu] of a serviceability
and the “for-which” [das Wofür] of a usability prescribed the ways in which
such a reference or assignment can become concrete. But the ‘indicating’ of
the sign and the ‘hammering’ of the hammer are not properties of entities.

Indeed, they are not properties at all, if the ontological structure designated
by the term ‘property’ is that of some definite character which it is possible
for  Things  to  possess  [einer  möglichen  Bestimmtheit  von  Dingen].
Anything ready-to-hand is, at the worst, appropriate for some purposes and
inappropriate for others; and its ‘properties’ are, as it were, still bound up in
these ways in which it is appropriate or inappropriate,(1) just as presence-
at-hand, as a possible kind of Being for something ready-to-hand, is bound
up in readiness-to-hand. Serviceability too, however, as a constitutive state
of equipment (and serviceability is a reference), is not an appropriateness of
some entity; it is rather the condition (so far as Being is in question) which
makes  it  possible  for  the  character  of  such  an  entity  to  be  defined  by  its
appropriatenesses. But what, then, is “reference” or “assignment” to mean?
To say that the Being of the ready-to-hand has the structure of assignment
or reference means that it has in itself the character of having been assigned
or  referred  [Verwiesenheit].  An  entity  is  discovered  when  it  has  been
assigned  or  referred  to  something,  and  referred  as  that  entity  which  it  is.
With any such entity there is an involvement which it has in something.(2)
The character of Being which belongs to the ready-to-hand is just such an
involvement.  If  something  has  an  involvement,  this  implies  letting  it  be
involved  in  something.  The  relationship  of  the  “with...  in…”  shall  be
indicated by the term “assignment” or “reference”.(3)
 

1. The words ‘property’ and ‘appropriateness’ reflect the etymological connection of Heidegger’s

‘Eigenschaft’ and “Geeignetheit’.

2.  ‘Es  hat  mit  ihm  bei  etwas  sein  Bewenden.’  The  terms  ‘Bewenden’  and  ‘Bewandtnis’  are
among the most difficult for the translator. Their root meaning has to do with the way something is
already ‘turning’ when one lets it ‘go its own way’, ‘run its course’, follow its ‘bent’ or ‘tendency’,
or  finish  ‘what  it  is  about’,  ‘what  it  is  up  to’  or  ‘what  it  is  involved  in’.  The  German  expressions,
however, have no simple English equivalents, but are restricted to a rather special group of idioms
such  as  the  following,  which  we  have  taken  from  Wildhagen  and  Héraucourt’s  admirable  English-
German, German-English Dictionary (Volume II, Wiesbaden 1953): ‘es dabei bewenden lassen’—‘to
leave it at that, to let it go at that, to let it rest there’; ‘und dabei hatte es sein Bewenden’—‘and there
the matter ended’; ‘dabei muss es sein Bewenden haben’—‘there the matter must rest’—‘that must
suffice’;  ‘die  Sache  hat  eine  ganz  andere  Bewandtnis’—‘the  case  is  quite  different’;  ‘damit  hat  es
seine besondere Bewandtnis’—‘there is something peculiar about it; thereby hangs a tale’; ‘damit hat
est folgende Bewandtnis’—‘the matter is as follows’.

We  have  tried  to  render  both  ‘Bewenden’  and  ‘Bewandtnis’  by  expressions  including  either
‘involve’ or ‘involvement’. But the contexts into which these words can easily be fitted in ordinary
English do not correspond very well to those which are possible for ‘Bewenden’ and ‘Bewandtnis’.
Our task is further complicated by the emphasis which Heidegger gives to the prepositions ‘mit’ and
‘bei’ in connection with ‘Bewenden’ and ‘Bewandtnis’. In passages such as the present one, it would
be  more  idiomatic  to  leave  these  prepositions  untranslated  and  simply  write:  ‘Any  such  entity  is
involved in doing something’, or ‘Any such entity is involved in some activity’. But ‘mit’ and ‘bei’

receive so much attention in this connection that in contexts such as this we shall sometimes translate
them  as  ‘with’  and  ‘in’,  though  elsewhere  we  shall  handle  ‘bei’  very  differently.  (The  reader  must
bear  in  mind  that  the  kind  of  ‘involvement’  with  which  we  are  here  concerned  is  always  an
involvement of equipment in ‘what it is up to’ or what it is ‘doing’, not a person’s involvement in
circumstances in which he is ‘caught’ or ‘entangled’.

3. ‘In Bewandtnis liegt: bewenden lassen mit etwas bei etwas. Der Bezug des “mit… bei...” soll
durch den Terminus Verweisung angezeigt werden.’ Here the point seems to be that if something has
an ‘involvement’ in the sense of ‘Bewandtnis’ (or rather, if there is such an involvement ‘with’ it),
the  thing  which  has  this  involvement  has  been  ‘assigned’  or  ‘referred’  for  a  certain  activity  or
purpose ‘in’ which it may be said to be involved.

When an entity within-the-world  has already been proximally  freed  for
its Being, that Being is its “involvement”.  W i t h  any such entity as entity,
there  is  some  involvement.  The  fact  that  it  has  such  an  involvement  is
ontologically definitive for the Being of such an entity, and is not an ontical
assertion  about  it.  That  in  which  it  is  involved  is  the  “towards-which”  of
serviceability,  and  the  “for-which”  of  usability.(1)  With  the  “towards-
which” of serviceability there can again be an involvement: with this thing,
for  instance,  which  is  ready-to-hand,  and  which  we  accordingly  call  a
“hammer”, there is an involvement in hammering; with hammering, there is
an  involvement  in  making  something  fast;  with  making  something  fast,
there  is  an  involvement  in  protection  against  bad  weather;  and  this
protection  ‘is’  for  the  sake  of  [um-willen]  providing  shelter  for  Dasein—
that  is  to  say,  for  the  sake  of  a  possibility  of  Dasein’s  Being.  Whenever
something ready-to-hand has an involvement with it, what involvement this
is, has in each case been outlined in advance in terms of the totality of such
involvements.  In  a  workshop,  for  example,  the  totality  of  involvements
which  is  constitutive  for  the  ready-to-hand  in  its  readiness-to-hand,  is
‘earlier’ than any single item of equipment; so too for the farmstead with all
its utensils and outlying lands. But the totality of involvements itself goes
back  ultimately  to  a  “towards-which”  in  which  there  is  no  further
involvement: this “towards-which” is not an entity with the kind of Being
that belongs to what is ready-to-hand within a world; it is rather an entity
whose Being is defined as Being-in-the-world, and to whose state of Being,
worldhood itself belongs. This primary “towards-which” is not just another
“towards-this”  as  something  in  which  an  involvement  is  possible.  The
primary  ‘towards-which’  is  a  “for-the-sake-of-which”.(2)  But  the  ‘for-the-
sake-of’  always  pertains  to  the  Being  of  Dasein,  for  which,  in  its  Being,
that  very  Being  is  essentially  an  issue.  We  have  thus  indicated  the
interconnection by which the structure of an involvement leads to Dasein’s

very  Being  as  the  sole  authentic  “for-the-sake-of-which”;  for  the  present,
however,  we  shall  pursue  this  no  further.  ‘Letting  something  be  involved’
must  first  be  clarified  enough  to  give  the  phenomenon  of  worldhood  the
kind  of  definiteness  which  makes  it  possible  to  formulate  any  problems
about it.
 

1.  ‘Bewandtnis  ist  das  Sein  des  innerweltlichen  Seienden,  darauf  es  je  schon  zunächst
freigegeben ist. Mit ihm als Seiendem hat es je eine Bewandtnis. Dieses, dass es eine Bewandtnis hat,
ist die ontologische  Bestimmung  des  Seins  dieses  Seienden,  nicht  eine  ontische  Aussage  über  das
Seiende.  Das  Wobei  es  die  Bewandtnis  hat,  ist  das  Wozu  der  Dienlichkeit,  das  Wofür  der
Verwendbarkeit.’  This  passage  and  those  which  follow  are  hard  to  translate  because  Heidegger  is
using  three  carefully  differentiated  prepositions  (‘zu’,  ‘für’,  and  ‘auf’)  where  English  idiom  needs
only ‘for’. We can say that something is serviceable, usable, or applicable ‘for’ a purpose and that it
may be freed or given free rein ‘for’ some kind of activity. In German, however, it will be said to
have ‘Dienlichkeit zu...’, ‘Verwendbarkeit für...’, and it will be ‘freigegeben auf...’. In the remainder
of this section we shall use ‘for’ both for ‘für’ and for ‘auf’ as they occur in these expressions; we
shall, however, continue to use ‘towards-which’ for the ‘Wozu’ of ‘Dienlichkeit’. See note 1, H. 78
above.

Ontically,  “letting  something  be  involved”  signifies  that  within  our
factical  concern  we  let  something  ready-to-hand  be  so-and-so  as  it  is
already and in order that it be such.(1) The way we take this ontical sense
of  ‘letting  be’  is,  in  principle,  ontological.  And  therewith  we  Interpret  the
meaning of previously freeing what is proximally ready-to-hand within-the-
world. Previously letting something ‘be’ does not mean that we must first
bring it into its Being and produce it; it means rather that something which
is already an ‘entity’ must be discovered in its readiness-to-hand, and that
we  must  thus  let  the  entity  which  has  this  Being  be  encountered.  This  ‘a
priori’ letting-something-be-involved is the condition for the possibility of
encountering anything ready-to-hand, so that Dasein, in its ontical dealings
with the entity thus encountered, can thereby let it be involved in the ontical
sense.(2) On the other hand, if letting something be involved is understood
ontologically,  what  is  then  pertinent  is  the  freeing  of  everything  ready-to-
hand  as  ready-to-hand,  no  matter  whether,  taken  ontically,  it  is  involved
thereby,  or  whether  it  is  rather  an  entity  of  precisely  such  a  sort  that
ontically it is not involved thereby. Such entities are, proximally and for the
most part, those with which we concern ourselves when we do not let them

‘be’  as  we  have  discovered  that  they  are,  but  work  upon  them,  make
improvements in them, or smash them to pieces.

When we  speak of having  already let something be involved, so that it
has been freed for that involvement, we are using a perfect tense  a  p r i o r
i    which  characterizes  the  kind  of  Being  belonging  to  Dasein  itself.(3)
Letting an entity be involved, if we understand this ontologically, consists
in  previously  freeing  it  for  [auf]  its  readiness-to-hand  within  the
environment.
 

1.  ‘Bewendenlassen  bedeutet  ontisch;  innerhalb  eines  faktischen  Besorgens  ein  Zuhandenes  so

und so sein lassen, wie es nunmehr ist und damit es so ist.’

2.  ‘…es  im  ontischen  Sinne  dabei  bewenden  lassen  kann.’  While  we  have  translated  ‘dabei’
simply  as  ‘thereby’  in  this  context,  it  is  possible  that  it  should  have  been  construed  rather  as  an
instance  of  the  special  use  of  ‘bei’  with  ‘bewenden  lassen’.  A  similar  ambiguity  occurs  in  the
following sentence.

3.  ‘Das  auf  Bewandtnis  hin  freigebende  Je-schon-haben-bewenden-lassen  ist  ein  apriorisches

Perfekt, das die Seinsart des Daseins selbst charakterisiert.

When we let something be involved, it must be involved in something;
and  in  terms  of  this  “in-which”,  the  “with-which”  of  this  involvement  is
freed.(1)  Our  concern  encounters  it  as  this  thing  that  is  ready-to-hand.  To
the  extent  that any entity shows  itself to  concern(2)—that  is,  to  the  extent
that  it  is  discovered  in  its  Being—it  is  already  something  ready-to-hand
environmentally;  it  just  is  not  ‘proximally’  a  ‘world-stuff’  that  is  merely
present-at-hand.

As  the  Being  of  something  ready-to-hand,  an  involvement  is  itself
discovered  only  on  the  basis  of  the  prior  discovery  of  a  totality  of
involvements.  So  in  any  involvement  that  has  been  discovered  (that  is,  in
anything  ready-to-hand  which  we  encounter),  what  we  have  called  the
“worldly  character”  of  the  ready-to-hand  has  been  discovered  beforehand.
In  this  totality  of  involvements  which  has  been  discovered  beforehand,
there  lurks  an  ontological  relationship  to  the  world.  In  letting  entities  be
involved so that they are freed for a totality of involvements, one must have
disclosed already that for which [woraufhin] they have been freed. But that
for  which  something  environmentally  ready-to-hand  has  thus  been  freed
(and indeed in such a manner that it becomes accessible as an entity within-
the-world  first  of  all),  cannot  itself  be  conceived  as  an  entity  with  this
discovered kind of Being. It is essentially not discoverable, if we henceforth

reserve “discoveredness” as  a  term  for  a  possibility  of  Being  which  every
entity without the character of Dasein may possess.

H. 86

 

But what does it mean to say that that for which(3) entities within-the-
world  are  proximally  freed  must  have  been  previously  disclosed?  To
Dasein’s  Being,  an  understanding  of  Being  belongs.  Any  understanding
[Verständnis] has its Being in an act of understanding [Verstehen]. If Being-
in-the-world is a kind of Being which is essentially befitting to Dasein, then
to  understand  Being-in-the-world  belongs  to  the  essential  content  of  its
understanding of Being. The previous disclosure of that for which what we
encounter  within-the-world  is  subsequently  freed,(4)  amounts  to  nothing
else than understanding the world—that world towards which Dasein as an
entity always comports itself.
 

1. ‘Aus dem Wobei des Bewendenlassens her ist das Womit der Bewandtnis freigegeben.’
2.  Here  we  follow  the  newer  editions  in  reading:  ‘Sofern  sich  ihm  überhaupt  ein  Seiendes
zeigt...’. The older editions read ‘Sofern sich mit ihm...’, which is somewhat ambiguous but suggests
that we should write: ‘To the extent that with what is ready-to-hand any entity shows itself…’.

3. ‘worauf’. The older editions have ‘woraufhin’.
4.  ‘Das  vorgängige  Erschliessen  dessen,  woraufhin  die  Freigabe  des 

innerweltlichen

Begegnenden erfolgt...’

Whenever we let there be an involvement with something in something
beforehand,  our  doing  so  is  grounded  in  our  understanding  such  things  as
letting something be involved, and such things as the “with-which” and the
“in-which” of involvements. Anything of this sort, and anything else that is
basic  for  it,  such  as  the  “towards-this”  as  that  in  which  there  is  an
involvement,  or  such  as  the  “for-the-sake-of-which”  to  which  every
“towards-which”  ultimately  goes  back(1)—all  these  must  be  disclosed
beforehand with a certain intelligibility [Verständlichkeit]. And what is that
wherein Dasein as Being-in-the-world understands itself pre-ontologically?
In understanding a context of relations such as we have mentioned, Dasein
has assigned itself to an “in-order-to” [Um-zu], and it has done so in terms
of a potentiality-for-Being for the sake of which it itself  i s—one which it
may have seized upon either explicitly or tacitly, and which may be either
authentic or inauthentic. This “in-order-to” prescribes a “towards-this” as a
possible “in-which” for letting something be involved; and the structure of

letting  it be involved implies  that this is  an involvement  which something
has—an involvement which is with something. Dasein always assigns itself
from a “for-the-sake-of-which” to the “with-which” of an involvement; that
is  to  say,  to  the  extent  that  it  is,  it  always  lets  entities  be  encountered  as
ready-to-hand.(2)  That  wherein 
itself
beforehand in the mode of assigning itself is that for which [das Woraufhin]
it  has  let  entities  be  encountered  beforehand.  The  “wherein”  of  an  act  of
understanding  which  assigns  or  refers  itself,  is  that  for  which  one  lets
entities  be  encountered  in  the  kind  of  Being  that  belongs  to  involvements;
and this “wherein” is the phenomenon of the world.(3) And the structure of
that  to  which  [woraufhin]  Dasein  assigns  itself  is  what  makes  up  the
worldhood of the world.
 

[Worin]  Dasein  understands 

1.  ‘…wie  das  Dazu,  als  wobei  es  die  Bewandtnis  hat,  das  Worum-willen,  darauf  letztlich  alles
Wozu  zurückgeht.’  The  older  editions  have  ‘...als  wobei  es  je  die  Bewandtnis  hat...’  and  omit  the
hyphen in ‘Worum-willen’.

2.  ‘Dieses  zeichnet  ein  Dazu  vor,  als  mögliches  Wobei  eines  Bewendenlassens,  das
strukturmässig  mit  etwas  bewenden  lässt.  Dasein  verweist  sich  je  schon  immer  aus  einem  Worum-
willen her an das Womit einer Bewandtnis, d. h. es lässt je immer schon, sofern es ist, Seiendes als
Zuhandenes begegnen.’

3.  ‘Das  Worin  des  sichverweisenden  Verstehens  als  Woraufhin  des  Begegnenlassens  von

Seiendem in der Seinsart der Bewandtnis ist das Phänomen der Welt.’
 

That  wherein  Dasein  already  understands  itself  in  this  way  is  always
something  with  which  it  is  primordially  familiar.  This  familiarity  with  the
world does not necessarily require that the relations which are constitutive
for  the  world  as  world  should  be  theoretically  transparent.  However,  the
possibility  of  giving  these  relations  an  explicit  ontologico-existential
Interpretation,  is  grounded  in  this  familiarity  with  the  world;  and  this
familiarity, in turn, is constitutive for Dasein, and goes to make up Dasein’s
understanding  of  Being.  This  possibility  is  one  which  can  be  seized  upon
explicitly  in  so  far  as  Dasein  has  set  itself  the  task  of  giving  a  primordial
Interpretation  for  its  own  Being  and  for  the  possibilities  of  that  Being,  or
indeed for the meaning of Being in general.

H. 87

 

But  as  yet  our  analyses  have  done  no  more  than  lay  bare  the  horizon
within which such things as the  world and worldhood are  to  be sought.  If

we are to consider these further, we must, in the first instance, make it still
more  clear  how  the  context  of  Dasein’s  assigning-itself  is  to  be  taken
ontologically.

In  the  act  of  understanding  [Verstehen],  which  we  shall  analyse  more
thoroughly later (Compare Section 31), the  relations  indicated above must
have been previously disclosed; the act of understanding holds them in this
disclosedness.  It  holds  itself  in  them  with  familiarity;  and  in  so  doing,  it
holds  them  before itself,  for  it  is  in  these  that  its  assignment  operates.(1)
The understanding lets itself make assignments both  i n  these relationships
themselves  and    o  f    them.(2)  The  relational  character  which  these
relationships  of  assigning  possess,  we  take  as  one  of  signifying.(3)  In  its
familiarity  with  these  relationships,  Dasein  ‘signifies’  to  itself:  in  a
primordial  manner  it  gives  itself  both  its  Being  and  its  potentiality-for-
Being  as  something  which  it  is  to  understand  with  regard  to  its  Being-in-
the-world.  The  “for-the-sake-of-which”  signifies  an  “in-order-to”;  this  in
turn,  a  “towards-this”;  the  latter,  an  “in-which”  of  letting  something  be
involved;  and  that  in  turn,  the  “with-which”  of  an  involvement.  These
relationships  are  bound  up  with  one  another  as  a  primordial  totality;  they
are  what  they  are    a  s   this  signifying  [Be-deuten]  in  which  Dasein  gives
itself beforehand its Being-in-the-world as something to be understood. The
relational  totality  of  this  signifying  we  call  “significance”.  This  is  what
makes up the structure of the world—the structure of that wherein Dasein
as such already is. Dasein, in its familiarity with significance, is the ontical
condition for the possibility of discovering entities which are encountered in
a  world  with  involvement  (readiness-to-hand)  as  their  kind  of  Being,  and
which can thus make themselves known as they are in themselves [in seinem
An-sich].
 

1.  ‘Das...  Verstehen...  hält  die  angezeigten  Bezüge  in  einer  vorgängigen  Erschlossenheit.  Im
vertrauten  Sich-darin-halten  hält  es sich  diese vor als  das,  worin  sich  sein  Verweisen  bewegt.’  The
context  suggests  that  Heidegger’s  ‘diese’  refers  to  the  relationships  (Bezüge)  rather  than  to  the
disclosedness  (Erschlossenheit),  though  the  latter  interpretation  seems  a  bit  more  plausible
grammatically.

2. ‘Das Verstehen lässt sich in und von diesen Bezügen selbst verweisen.’ It is not entirely clear

whether ‘von’ should be translated as ‘of’, from’, or ‘by’.

3. ‘be-deuten’. While Heidegger ordinarily writes this word without a hyphen (even, for instance,
in  the  next  sentence),  he  here  takes  pains  to  hyphenate  it  so  as  to  suggest  that  etymologically  it
consists of the intensive prefix ‘be-’ followed by the verb ‘deuten’—to ‘interpret’, ‘explain’ or ‘point
to’  something.  We  shall  continue  to  follow  our  convention  of  usually  translating  ‘bedeuten’  and
for
‘Bedeutung’  by 

‘signify’  and 

‘signification’ 

‘significance’ 

respectively, 

reserving 

‘Bedeutsamkeit’ (or, in a few cases, for ‘Bedeutung’). But these translations obscure the underlying
meanings which Heidegger is emphasizing in this passage.

Dasein as such is always something of this sort; along with its Being, a
context of the ready-to-hand is already essentially discovered: Dasein, in so
far  as  it  is,  has  always  submitted(1)  itself  already  to  a  ‘world’  which  it
encounters, and this submission(1) belongs essentially to its Being.
 

1.  ‘angewiesen’;  ‘Angewiesenheit’.  The  verb  ‘anweisen’,  like  ‘verweisen’,  can  often  be
translated as ‘assign’, particularly in the sense in which one assigns or allots a place to something, or
in the sense in which one gives an ‘assignment’ to someone by instructing him how to proceed. The
past participle ‘angewiesen’ can thus mean ‘assigned’ in either of these senses; but it often takes on
the  connotation  of  ‘being  dependent  on’  something  or  even  ‘at  the  mercy’  of  something.  In  this
passage  we  have  tried  to  compromise  by  using  the  verb  ‘submit’.  Other  passages  call  for  other
idioms, and no single standard translation seems feasible.

But  in  significance  itself,  with  which  Dasein  is  always  familiar,  there
lurks  the  ontological  condition  which  makes  it  possible  for  Dasein,  as
something  which  understands  and  interprets,  to  disclose  such  things  as
‘significations’; upon these, in turn, is founded the Being of words and of
language.

The  significance  thus  disclosed  is  an  existential  state  of  Dasein—of  its
Being-in-the-world; and as such it is the ontical condition for the possibility
that a totality of involvements can be discovered.

If  we  have  thus  determined  that  the  Being  of  the  ready-to-hand
(involvement)  is  definable  as  a  context  of  assignments  or  references,  and
that even worldhood may so be defined, then has not the ‘substantial Being’
of  entities  within-the-world  been  volatilized  into  a  system  of  Relations?
And  inasmuch  as  Relations  are  always  ‘something  thought’,  has  not  the
Being of entities within-the-world been dissolved into ‘pure thinking’?

H. 88

 

Within  our  present  field  of  investigation  the  following  structures  and
dimensions of ontological problematics, as we have repeatedly emphasized,
must be kept in principle distinct: 1. the Being of those entities within-the-
world which we proximally encounter—readiness-to-hand; 2. the Being of
those  entities  which  we  can  come  across  and  whose  nature  we  can
determine  if  we  discover  them  in  their  own  right  by  going  through  the

entities  proximally  encountered—presence-at-hand;  3.  the  Being  of  that
ontical condition which makes it possible for entities within-the-world to be
discovered  at  all—the  worldhood  of  the  world.  This  third  kind  of  Being
gives us an existential way of determining the nature of Being-in-the-world,
that  is,  of  Dasein.  The  other  two  concepts  of  Being  are  categories,  and
pertain to entities whose Being is not of the kind which Dasein possesses.
The  context  of  assignments  or  references,  which,  as  significance,  is
constitutive for worldhood, can be taken formally in the sense of a system
of Relations. But one must note that in such formalizations the phenomena
get  levelled  off  so  much  that  their  real  phenomenal  content  may  be  lost,
especially in the case of such ‘simple’ relationships as those which lurk in
significance.  The  phenomenal  content  of  these  ‘Relations’  and  ‘Relata’—
the  “in-order-to”,  the  “for-the-sake-of”,  and  the  “with-which”  of  an
involvement—is  such 
resist  any  sort  of  mathematical
functionalization; nor are they merely something thought, first posited in an
‘act  of  thinking.’  They  are  rather  relationships  in  which  concernful
circumspection  as  such  already  dwells.  This  ‘system  of  Relations’,  as
something constitutive for worldhood, is so far from volatilizing the Being
of  the  ready-to-hand  within-the-world,  that  the  worldhood  of  the  world
provides the basis on which such entities can for the first time be discovered
as they are ‘substantially’ ‘in themselves’. And only if entities within-the-
world can be encountered at all, is it possible, in the field of such entities, to
make  accessible  what  is  just  present-at-hand  and  no  more.  By  reason  of
their Being-just-present-at-hand-and-no-more, these latter entities can have
their 
‘functional  concepts.’
Ontologically, such concepts are possible only in relation to entities whose
Being has the character of pure substantiality. Functional concepts are never
possible except as formalized substantial concepts.

In  order  to  bring  out  the  specifically  ontological  problematic  of
worldhood  even  more  sharply,  we  shall  carry  our  analysis  no  further  until
we have clarified our Interpretation of worldhood by a case at the opposite
extreme.

B. A Contrast between our Analysis of Worldhood and Descartes’

Interpretation of the World

 

H. 89

 

Only step by step can the concept of worldhood and the structures which
this  phenomenon  embraces  be  firmly  secured  in  the  course  of  our
investigation.  The  Interpretation  of  the  world  begins,  in  the  first  instance,
with some entity within-the-world, so that the phenomenon of the world in
general no longer comes into view; we shall accordingly try to clarify this
approach  ontologically  by  considering  what  is  perhaps  the  most  extreme
form in which it has been carried out. We not only shall present briefly the
basic features of Descartes’ ontology of the ‘world’, but shall inquire into
its presuppositions and try to characterize these in the light of what we have
hitherto achieved. The account we shall give of these matters will enable us
to  know  upon  what  basically  undiscussed  ontological  ‘foundations’  those
Interpretations  of  the  world  which  have  come  after  Descartes—and  still
more those which preceded him—have operated.

Descartes  sees  the  extensio  as  basically  definitive  ontologically  for  the
world.  In  so  far  as  extension  is  one  of  the  constituents  of  spatiality
(according  to  Descartes  it  is  even  identical  with  it),  while  in  some  sense
spatiality  remains  constitutive  for  the  world,  a  discussion  of  the  Cartesian
ontology of the ‘world’ will provide us likewise with a negative support for
a  positive  explication  of  the  spatiality  of  the  environment  and  of  Dasein
itself.  With  regard  to  Descartes’  ontology  there  are  three  topics  which  we
shall treat: 1. the definition of the ‘world’ as res extensa (Section 19); 2. the
foundations  of  this  ontological  definition  (Section  20); 3.  a  hermeneutical
discussion  of  the  Cartesian  ontology  of  the  ‘world’  (Section  21).  The
considerations which follow will not have been grounded in full detail until
the  ‘cogito  sum’  has  been  phenomenologically  destroyed.  (See  Part  Two,
Division 2.)(1)

H. 90

Descartes  distinguishes  the  ‘ego  cogito’  from  the  ‘res  corporea’.  This
distinction will thereafter be determinative ontologically for the distinction
between  ‘Nature’  and  ‘spirit’.  No  matter  with  how  many  variations  of
content  the  opposition  between  ‘Nature’  and  ‘spirit’  may  get  set  up
ontically,  its  ontological  foundations,  and  indeed  the  very  poles  of  this
opposition,  remain  unclarified;  this  unclarity  has  its  proximate  [nächste]
roots  in  Descartes’  distinction.  What  kind  of  understanding  of  Being  does
he have when he defines the Being of these entities? The term for the Being
of  an  entity  that  is  in  itself,  is  “substantia”.  Sometimes  this  expression
means the Being of an entity as substance, substantiality; at  other times it
means the entity itself, a substance. That “substantia” is  used in  these two
ways  is  no  accidental;  this  already  holds  for  the  ancient  conception  of
οὐσία.

To  determine  the  nature  of  the  res  corporea  ontologically,  we  must
explicate  the  substance  of  this  entity  as  a  substance—that  is,  its
substantiality. What makes up the authentic Being-in-itself [An-ihm-selbst-
sein] of the res corporea? How is it at all possible to grasp a substance as
such,  that  is,  to  grasp  its  substantiality?  “Et  quidem  ex  quolibet  attributo
substantia cognoscitur; sed una  tamen est cuiusque substantiae praecipua
proprietas,  quae ipsius  naturam essentiamque constituit, et  ad  quam aliae
omnes  referuntur.”(iii)  Substances  become  accessible  in  their  ‘attributes’,
and every substance has some distinctive property from which the essence
of  the  substantiality  of  that  definite  substance  can  be  read  off.  Which
property is this in the case of the res corporea? “Nempe  e x t e n s i o  in
longum, 
naturam
constituit.”(iv)  Extension—namely,  in  length,  breadth,  and  thickness—
makes  up  the  real  Being  of  that  corporeal  substance  which  we  call  the
‘world’.  What  gives the extensio  this distinctive  status? “Nam  omne  aliud
quod corpori tribui potest,  extensionem praesupponit...”(v)  Extension  is  a
state-of-Being  constitutive  for  the  entity  we  are  talking  about;  it  is  that
which  must  already  ‘be’  before  any  other  ways  in  which  Being  is
determined,  so  that  these  can  ‘be’  what  they  are.  Extension  must  be
‘assigned’  [“zugewiesen”]  primarily  to  the  corporeal  Thing.  The  ‘world’s’
extension and substantiality (which itself is characterized by extension) are
accordingly  demonstrated  by  showing  how  all  the  other  characteristics
which this substance definitely possesses (especially divisio, figura, motus),

profundum, 

substantiae 

corporeae 

latum 

et 

can  be  conceived  only  as  modi  of  extensio,  while,  on  the  other  hand,
extensio sine figura vel motu remains quite intelligible.

Thus  a  corporeal  Thing  that  maintains  its  total  extension  can  still
undergo many changes in the ways in which that extension is distributed in
the various dimensions, and can present itself in manifold shapes as one and
the  same  Thing.  “...  atque  unum  et  idem  corpus,  retinendo  suam  eandem
quantitatem,  pluribus  diversis  modis  potest  extendi:  nunc  scilicet  magis
secundum longitudinem, minusque secundum latitudinem vel profunditatem,
ac  paulo  post  e  contra  magis  secundum  latitudinem,  et  minus  secundum
longitudinem.”(vi)
 

iii. Descartes, Principia Philosophiae,  I,  Pr.  53.  (Œuvres,  ed.  Adam  and  Tannery,  vol.  VIII,  p.
25.) [‘And though substance is indeed known by some attribute, yet for each substance there is pre-
eminently  one  property  which  constitutes  its  nature  and  essence,  and  to  which  all  the  rest  are
referred.’—Tr.]

iv. Ibid. [‘Indeed extension in  length,  breadth,  and  thickness  constitutes  the  nature  of  corporeal

substance.’ The emphasis is Heidegger’s.—Tr.]

v. Ibid. [‘For everything else that can be ascribed to body presupposes extension.’—Tr.]
vi. Ibid., Pr.  64,  p.  31.  [‘And  one  and  the  same  body  can  be  extended  in  many  different  ways
while retaining the same quantity it had before; surely it can sometimes be greater in length and less
in breadth or thickness, while later it may, on the contrary, be greater in breadth and less in length.’—
Tr.]

H. 91

 

Shape  is  a  modus of extensio,  and  so  is  motion:  for  motus  is  grasped
only  “si  de  nullo  nisi  locali  cogitemus,  ac  de  vi  a  qua  excitatur…  non
inquiramus.”(vii)  If  the  motion  is  a  property  of  the  res  corporea,  and  a
property which  i s, then in order for it to be experienceable in its Being, it
must  be  conceived  in  terms  of  the  Being  of  this  entity  itself,  in  terms  of
extensio; this means that it must be conceived as mere change of location.
So nothing like ‘force’ counts for anything in determining what the Being
of this entity is. Matter may have such definite characteristics as hardness,
weight, and colour (durities, pondus, color); but these can all be taken away
from it, and it still remains what it is. These do not go to make up its real
Being;  and  in  so  far  as  they  are,  they  turn  out  to  be  modes  of  extensio.
Descartes  tries  to  show  this  in  detail  with  regard  to  ‘hardness’:  “Nam,
quantum ad duritiem, nihil aliud de illa sensus nobis indicat, quam partes
durorum  corporum  resistere  motui  manuum  nostrarum,  cum  in  illas
incurrant.  Si  enim,  quotiescunque  manus  nostrae  versus  aliquam  partem

moventur,  corpora  omnia  ibi  existentia  recederent  eadem  celeritate  qua
illae  accedunt,  nullam  unquam  duritiem  sentiremus.  Nec  ullo  modo  potest
intelligi,  corpora  quae  sic  recederent,  idcirco  naturam  corporis  esse
amissura;  nec  proinde  ipsa  in  duritie  consistit.”(viii)  Hardness  is
experienced  when  one  feels  one’s  way  by  touch  [Tasten].  What  does  the
sense  of  touch  ‘tell’  us  about  it?  The  parts  of  the  hard  Thing  ‘resist’  a
movement of the hand, such as an attempt to push it away. If, however, hard
bodies, those which do not give way, should change their locations with the
same  velocity  as  that  of  the  hand  which  ‘strikes  at’  them,  nothing  would
ever  get  touched  [Berühren],  and  hardness  would  not  be  experienced  and
would  accordingly  never  be.  But  it  is  quite  incomprehensible  that  bodies
which give way with such velocity should thus forfeit any of their corporeal
Being.  If  they  retain  this  even  under  a  change  in  velocity  which  makes  it
impossible for anything like ‘hardness’ to be, then hardness does not belong
to  the  Being  of  entities  of  this  sort.  “Eademque  ratione  ostendi  potest,  et
pondus,  et  colorem,  et  alias  omnes  eiusmodi  qualitates,  quae  in  materia
corporea  sentiuntur,  ex  ea  tolli  posse,  ipsa  integra  remanente:  unde
sequitur,  a  nulla  ex  illis  eius  <sc.  extensionis>  naturam  dependere.”(ix)
Thus  what  makes  up  the  Being  of  the  res  corporea  is  the  extensio:  that
which is omnimodo divisibile,  figurabile  et  mobile  (that  which can change
itself by being divided, shaped, or moved in any way), that which is capax
mutationum—that  which  maintains  itself  (remanet)  through  all  these
changes.  In  any  corporeal  Thing  the  real  entity  is  what  is  suited  for  thus
remaining  constant  [ständigen  Verbleib],  so  much  so,  indeed  that  this  is
how the substantiality of such a substance gets characterized.

the force by which it is set in motion…’—Tr.]

viii. Ibid., II, Pr. 4. p. 42 [‘For, so far as hardness is concerned, the sense shows us nothing else
about  it  than  that  portions  of  hard  bodies  resist  the  movement  of  our  hands  when  they  come  up
against those portions. For if whenever our hands are moved towards a certain portion, all the bodies
there should retreat with the same velocity as that with which our hands approach, we should never
feel any hardness. Nor is it in any way intelligible that bodies which thus recede should accordingly
lose their corporeal nature; hence this does not consist in hardness.’—Tr.]

qualities  of  this  sort  which  are  sensed  in  corporeal  matter,  can  be  taken  away  from  it,  while  that
matter  remains  entire;  it  follows  that  the  nature  of  this  <viz.  of  extension>  depends  upon  none  of
these.’—Tr.]

20. Foundations of the Ontological Definition of the ‘World’

 

 

H. 92

is 

the 

to  which 

Substantiality 

the  ontological
idea  of  Being 
characterization of the res extensa  harks  back. “Per    s  u  b  s  t  a  n  t  i  a  m
 nihil aliud intelligere possumus, quam rem quae ita existit, ut nulla alia re
indigeat  ad  existendum.”  “By  substance  we  can  understand  nothing  else
than an entity which is in such a way that it needs no other entity in order to
be.”(x) The Being of a ‘substance’ is characterized by not needing anything.
That  whose  Being  is  such  that  it  has  no  need  at  all  for  any  other  entity
satisfies  the  idea  of  substance  in  the  authentic  sense;  this  entity  is  the  ens
perfectissimum. “…substantia  quae  nulla  plane  re  indigeat,  unica  tantum
potest intelligi, nempe Deus.”(xi) Here ‘God’ is a purely ontological term,
if it is to be understood as ens perfectissimum. At the same time, the ‘self-
evident’  connotation  of  the  concept  of  God  is  such  as  to  permit  an
ontological interpretation for the characteristic of not needing anything—a
constitutive  item  in  substantiality.  “Alias  vero  omnes  <res>,  non  nisi  ope
concursus Dei existere posse percipimus.”(xii) All  entities other  than  God
need to be “produced” in the widest sense and also to be sustained. ‘Being’
is  to  be  understood  within  a  horizon  which  ranges  from  the  production  of
what  is  to  be  present-at-hand  to  something  which  has  no  need  of  being
produced.  Every  entity  which  is  not  God  is  an  ens  creatum.  The  Being
which  belongs  to  one  of  these  entities  is  ‘infinitely’  different  from  that
which belongs to the other; yet we still consider creation and creator alike
as entities. We are thus using “Being” in so wide a sense that its meaning
embraces  an  ‘infinite’  difference.  So  even  created  entities  can  be  called
“substance” with some right. Relative to God, of course, these entities need
to be produced and sustained; but within the realm of created entities—the
‘world’ in the sense of ens creatum—there are things which ‘are in need of
no other entity’ relatively to the creaturely production and sustentation that
we find, for instance, in man. Of these substances there are two kinds: the
res cogitans and the res extensa.
 

x. Ibid., I, Pr. 51, p. 24. [‘Indeed we perceive that no other things exist without the help of God’s

xi. Ibid. [‘...only one substance which is in need of nothing whatsoever, can be understood, and

concurrence.’—Tr.]

this indeed is God.’—Tr.]

xii.  Ibid.  [‘Indeed  we  perceive  that  other  things  cannot  exist  without  the  help  of  God’s

concurrence.’—Tr.]

H. 93

 

The Being of that substance whose distinctive proprietas is presented by
extensio thus becomes definable in principle ontologically if we clarify the
meaning of Being which is ‘common’ to the three kinds of substances, one
of  them  infinite,  the  others  both  finite.  But  “...nomen  substantiae  non
convenit Deo et illis  u n i v o c e  ut  dici solet  in  Scholis,  hoc est... quae
Deo  et  creaturis  sit  communis.”(xiii)  Here  Descartes  touches  upon  a
problem with which medieval ontology was often busied—the question of
how  the  signification  of  “Being”  signifies  any  entity  which  one  may  on
occasion  be  considering.  In  the  assertions  ‘God  is’  and  ‘the  world  is’,  we
assert  Being.  This  word  ‘is’,  however,  cannot  be  meant  to  apply  to  those
entities in the same sense (συνωνύμως, univoce),when  between them there
is an infinite difference of Being; if the signification of ‘is’ were univocal,
then  what  is  created  would  be  viewed  as  if  it  were  uncreated,  or  the
uncreated would be reduced to the status of something created. But neither
does ‘Being’ function as a mere name which is the same in both cases: in
both  cases  ‘Being’  is  understood.  This  positive  sense  in  which  ‘Being’
signifies is one which the Schoolmen took as a signification ‘by analogy’,
as  distinguished  from  one  which  is  univocal  or  merely  homonymous.
is
Taking 
foreshadowed  in  prototypical  form  just  as  at  the  very  outset  of  Greek
ontology,  they  established  various  kinds  of  analogy,  so  that  even  the
‘Schools’  have  different  ways  of  taking  the  signification-function  of
“Being”. In working out this problem ontologically, Descartes is always far
behind  the  Schoolmen;(xiv)  indeed  he  evades  the  question.  “...nulla  eius
<substantiae>  nominis  significatio  potest  distincte  intelligi,  quae  Deo  et
creaturis  sit  communis.”(xv)  This  evasion  is  tantamount  to  his  failing  to
discuss the meaning of Being which the idea of substantiality embraces, or
the  character  of  the  ‘universality’  which  belongs  to  this  signification.  Of
course even the ontology of the medievals has gone no further than that of
the  ancients  in  inquiring  into  what  “Being”  itself  may  mean.  So  it  is  not
surprising  if  no  headway  is  made  with  a  question  like  that  of  the  way  in
which “Being” signifies, as long as this has to be discussed on the basis of

their  departure  from  Aristotle, 

this  problem 

in  whom 

an  unclarified  meaning  of  Being  which  this  signification  ‘expresses’.  The
meaning remains unclarified because it is held to be ‘self-evident’.
 

xiii.  Ibid.  [The  complete  passage  may  be  translated  as  follows:  ‘The  name  “substance”  is  not
appropriate to God and to these univocally, as they say in the Schools; that is, no signification of this
name which would be common to both God and his creation can be distinctly understood.’—Tr.]

H. 94

 

Descartes  not  only  evades  the  ontological  question  of  substantiality
altogether; he also emphasizes explicitly that substance as such—that is to
say,  its  substantiality—is  in  and  for  itself  inaccessible  from  the  outset
[vorgängig].  “Verumtamen  non  potest  substantia  primum  animadverti  ex
hoc  solo,  quod  sit  res  existens,  quia  hoc  solum  per  se  nos  non
afficit…”(xvi) ‘Being’  itself  does  not  ‘affect’  us,  and  therefore  cannot  be
perceived.  ‘Being  is  not  a  Real  predicate,’  says  Kant,(1)  who  is  merely
repeating Descartes’ principle. Thus the possibility of a pure problematic of
Being gets renounced in principle, and a way is sought for arriving at those
definite  characteristics  of  substance  which  we  have  designated  above.
Because  ‘Being’  is  not  in  fact  accessible  as  an  entity,  it  is  expressed
through  attributes—definite  characteristics  of 
the  entities  under
consideration,  characteristics  which  themselves    a  r  e.(2)  Being  is  not
expressed through just  a n y  such characteristics, but rather through those
that  meaning  of  “Being”  and
satisfying 
“substantiality”, which has still been tacitly presupposed. To the substantia
finita as res corporea, what must primarily be ‘assigned’ [“Zuweisung”] is
the  extensio.  “Quin  et  facilius  intelligimus  substantiam  extensam,  vel
substantiam  cogitantem,  quam  substantiam  solam,  omisso  eo  quod  cogitet
vel  sit  extensa”;(xvii)  for  substantiality  is  detachable  ratione  tantum;  it  is
not detachable realiter, nor can we come across it in the way in which we
come across those entities themselves which are substantially.

the  purest  manner 

in 

Thus the ontological grounds for defining the ‘world’ as res extensa have
been  made  plain:  they  lie  in  the  idea  of  substantiality,  which  not  only
remains  unclarified  in  the  meaning  of  its  Being,  but  gets  passed  off  as
something incapable of clarification, and gets represented indirectly by way

of  whatever  substantial  property  belongs  most  pre-eminently  to  the
particular substance. Moreover, in this way of defining “substance” through
some substantial entity, lies the reason why the term “substance” is used in
two ways. What is here intended is substantiality; and it gets understood in
terms  of  a  characteristic  of  substance—a  characteristic  which  is  itself  an
entity.(3) Because something ontical is made to underlie the ontological, the
expression “substantia” functions  sometimes  with  a  signification  which  is
ontological,  sometimes  with  one  which  is  ontical,  but  mostly  with  one
which  is  hazily  ontico-ontological.  Behind  this  slight  difference  of
signification,  however,  there  lies  hidden  a  failure  to  master  the  basic
problem  of  Being.  To  treat  this  adequately,  we  must  ‘track  down’  the
equivocations in the right way. He who attempts this sort of thing does not
just  ‘busy  himself’  with  ‘merely  verbal  significations’;  he  must  venture
forward into the most primordial problematic of the ‘things themselves’ to
get such ‘nuances’ straightened out.

21.  Hermeneutical  Discussion  of  the  Cartesian  Ontology  of  the

‘World’
 

H. 95

 

The critical question now arises: does this ontology of the ‘world’ seek
the phenomenon of the world at all, and if not, does it at least define some
entity  within-the-world  fully  enough  so  that  the  worldly  character  of  this
entity can be made visible in it? To both questions we must answer “No”.
The entity which Descartes is trying to grasp ontologically and in principle
with his “extensio”, is rather such as to become discoverable first of all by
going through an entity within-the-world which is proximally ready-to-hand

is 

this 

the  case,  and 

though  any  ontological
—Nature.  Though 
characterization  of  this  latter  entity  within-the-world  may  lead  us  into
obscurity,  even  if  we  consider  both  the  idea  of  substantiality  and  the
meaning of the “existit” and “ad existendum” which have been brought into
the definition of that idea, it still remains possible that through an ontology
based  upon  a  radical  separation  of  God,  the  “I”,  and  the  ‘world’,  the
ontological  problem  of  the  world  will  in  some  sense  get  formulated  and
further  advanced.  If,  however,  this  is  not  possible,  we  must  then
demonstrate  explicitly  not  only  that  Descartes’  conception  of  the  world  is
ontologically  defective,  but  that  his  Interpretation  and  the  foundations  on
which  it  is  based  have  led  him  to  pass  over both  the  phenomenon  of  the
world and the Being of those entities within-the-world which are proximally
ready-to-hand.

In  our  exposition  of  the  problem  of  worldhood  (Section  14),  we
suggested  the  importance  of  obtaining  proper  access  to  this  phenomenon.
So in criticizing the Cartesian point of departure, we must ask which kind of
Being that belongs to Dasein we should fix upon as giving us an appropriate
way  of  access  to  those  entities  with  whose  Being  as  extensio  Descartes
equates  the  Being  of  the  ‘world’.  The  only  genuine  access  to  them  lies  in
knowing  [Erkennen],  intellectio,  in  the  sense  of  the  kind  of  knowledge
[Erkenntnis] we get in mathematics and physics. Mathematical knowledge
is regarded by Descartes as the one manner of apprehending entities which
can  always  give  assurance  that  their  Being  has  been  securely  grasped.  If
anything  measures  up  in  its  own  kind  of  Being  to  the  Being  that  is
accessible  in  mathematical  knowledge,  then  it  is  in  the  authentic  sense.
Such entities are those which always are what they are.

H. 96

 

Accordingly,  that  which  can  be  shown  to  have  the  character  of
something that constantly remains (as remanens capax mutationum), makes
up the real Being of those entities of the world which get experienced. That
which  enduringly  remains,  really  is.  This  is  the  sort  of  thing  which
mathematics  knows.  That  which  is  accessible  in  an  entity  through
mathematics, makes  up  its  Being.  Thus  the  Being  of  the  ‘world’  is,  as  it
were, dictated to it in terms of a definite idea of Being which lies veiled in
the  concept  of  substantiality,  and  in  terms  of  the  idea  of  a  knowledge  by

which such entities are 
cognized. The kind of Being which belongs to entities within-the-world is
something which they themselves might have been permitted to present; but
Descartes does not let them do so.(1) Instead he prescribes for the world its
‘real’ Being, as it were, on the basis of an idea of Being whose source has
not been unveiled and which has not been demonstrated in its own right—
an idea in which Being is equated with constant presence-at-hand. Thus his
ontology  of  the  world  is  not  primarily  determined  by  his  leaning  towards
mathematics, a science which he chances to esteem very highly, but rather
by  his  ontological  orientation  in  principle  towards  Being  as  constant
presence-at-hand,  which  mathematical  knowledge  is  exceptionally  well
this  way  Descartes  explicitly  switches  over
suited 
philosophically  from  development  of  traditional  ontology  to  modern
mathematical physics and its transcendental foundations.
 

to  grasp.  In 

1. ‘Descartes lässt sich nicht die Seinsart des innerweltlichen Seienden von diesem vorgeben...’

The  problem  of  how  to  get  appropriate  access  to  entities  within-the-
world  is  one  which  Descartes  feels  no  need  to  raise.  Under  the  unbroken
ascendance  of  the  traditional  ontology,  the  way  to  get  a  genuine  grasp  of
what really  i s  [des eigentlichen Seienden] has been decided in advance: it
lies  in  νοεῖν—‘beholdlng’  in  the  widest  sense  [der  “Anschauung”  im
weitesten Sinne]; διανοείν or ‘thinking’ is just a more fully achieved form
of  νοεῖν  and  is  founded  upon  it.  Sensatio  (αἴσθησις),  as  opposed  to
intellectio,  still  remains  possible  as  a  way  of  access  to  entities  by  a
beholding  which  is  perceptual  in  character;  but  Descartes  presents  his
‘critique’ of it because he is oriented ontologically by these principles.

H. 97

 

Descartes  knows  very  well  that  entities  do  not  proximally  show
themselves  in  their  real  Being.  What  is  ‘proximally’  given  is  this  waxen
Thing  which  is  coloured,  flavoured,  hard,  and  cold  in  definite  ways,  and
which  gives  off  its  own  special  sound  when  struck.  But  this  is  not  of  any
importance  ontologically,  nor,  in  general,  is  anything  which  is  given
through  the  senses.  “Satis  erit,  si  advertamus  sensuum  perceptiones  non
referri,  nisi  ad  istam  corporis  humani  cum  mente  coniunctionem,  et  nobis

quidem ordinarie exhibere, quid ad illam externa corpora prodesse possint
aut nocere…”(xviii) The senses do not enable us to cognize any entity in its
Being; they merely serve to announce the ways in which ‘external’ Things
within-the-world  are  useful  or  harmful  for  human  creatures  encumbered
with  bodies.  “...non... nos  docere,  qualia  <corpora>  in  seipsis  existant”;
(xix)  they  tell  us  nothing  about  entities  in  their  Being.  “Quod  agentes,
percipiemus  naturam  materiae,  sive  corporis  in  universum  spectati,  non
consistere  in  eo  quod  sit  res  dura,  vel  ponderosa,  vel  colorata,  vel  alio
aliquo  modo  sensus  afficiens:  sed  tantum  in  eo  quod  sit  res  extensa  in
longum, latum et profundum.”(xx)

If we subject Descartes’ Interpretation of the experience of hardness and
resistance to a critical analysis, it will be plain how unable he is to let what
shows itself in sensation present itself in its own kind of Being,(1) or even
to determine its character (Cf. Section 19).
 

xviii. Ibid., II, Pr. 3, p. 45. [‘It will be enough if we point out that the perceptions of the senses
are  not  referred  to  anything  but  the  union  of  the  human  body  with  the  mind,  and  that  indeed  they
ordinarily show us in what way external bodies can be of help to it or do it harm.’—Tr.]

xix. Ibid., II, Pr. 3, pp. 41—42. [‘...but they do not teach us what kinds of things <bodies> exist

in themselves.’—Tr.]

xx. Ibid., II, Pr. 4, p. 42. [‘If we do this, we shall perceive that the nature of matter, or of body as
regarded universally, does not consist in its being something hard or heavy or coloured or affecting
the  senses  in  some  other  way,  but  only  in  its  being  something  extended  in  length,  breadth,  and
thickness.’—Tr.]
 

1. ‘...das in der Sinnlichkeit sich Zeigende in seiner eigenen Seinsart sich vorgeben zu lassen...’

Hardness gets taken as resistance. But neither hardness nor resistance is
understood  in  a  phenomenal  sense,  as  something  experienced  in  itself
whose  nature  can  be  determined  in  such  an  experience.  For  Descartes,
resistance  amounts  to  no  more  than  not  yielding  place—that  is,  not
undergoing any change of location. So if a Thing resists, this means that it
stays in a definite location relatively to some other Thing which is changing
its  location,  or  that  it  is  changing  its  own  location  with  a  velocity  which
permits  the  other  Thing  to  ‘catch  up’  with  it.  But  when  the  experience  of
hardness is Interpreted this way, the kind of Being which belongs to sensory
perception  is  obliterated,  and  so  is  any  possibility  that  the  entities
encountered in such perception should be grasped in their Being. Descartes
takes the kind of Being which belongs to the perception of something, and
translates  it  into  the  only  kind  he  knows:  the  perception  of  something

becomes  a  definite  way  of  Being-present-at-hand-side-by-side  of  two  res
extensae which are present-at-hand; the way in which their movements are
related is itself a mode of that extensio by which the presence-at-hand of the
corporeal Thing is primarily characterized. Of course no behaviour in which
one  feels  one’s  way  by  touch  [eines  tastenden  Verhaltens]  can  be
‘completed’ unless what can thus be felt [des Betastbaren] has ‘closeness’
of  a  very  special  kind.  But  this  does  not  mean  that  touching  [Berührung]
and 
touching  consist
ontologically in different velocities of two corporeal Things. Hardness and
resistance  do  not  show  themselves  at  all  unless  an  entity  has  the  kind  of
Being which Dasein—or at least something living—possesses.

the  hardness  which  makes 

itself  known 

in 

Thus Descartes’ discussion of possible kinds of access to entities within-
the-world is dominated by an idea of Being which has been gathered from a
definite realm of these entities themselves.

H. 98

 

The  idea  of  Being  as  permanent  presence-at-hand  not  only  gives
Descartes a motive for identifying entities within-the-world with the world
in general, and for providing so extreme a definition of their Being; it also
keeps him from bringing Dasein’s ways of behaving into view in a manner
which is ontologically appropriate. But thus the road is completely blocked
to  seeing  the  founded  character  of  all  sensory  and  intellective  awareness,
and to understanding these as possibilities of Being-in-the-world.(1) On the
contrary, he takes the Being of ‘Dasein’ (to whose basic constitution Being-
in-the-world belongs) in the very same way as he takes the Being of the res
extensa—namely, as substance.
 

1. ‘Damit ist aber vollends der Weg dazu verlegt, gar auch noch den fundierten Charakter alles
sinnlichen  und  verstandesmässigen  Vernehmens  zu  sehen  und  sie  als  eine  Möglichkeit  des  In-der-
Welt-seins zu verstehen.’ While we have construed the pronoun ‘sie’ as referring to the two kinds of
awareness which have just been mentioned, it would be grammatically more plausible to interpret it
as referring either to ‘Dasein’s ways of behaving’ or to ‘the idea of Being as permanent presence-at-
hand’.

But  with  these  criticisms,  have  we  not  fobbed  off  on  Descartes  a  task
altogether  beyond  his  horizon,  and  then  gone  on  to  ‘demonstrate’  that  he
has  failed  to  solve  it?  If  Descartes  does  not  know  the  phenomenon  of  the

world, and thus knows no such thing as within-the-world-ness, how can he
identify the world itself with certain entities within-the-world and the Being
which they possess?

In controversy over principles, one must not only attach oneself to theses
which  can  be  grasped  doxographically;  one  must  also  derive  one’s
orientation from the objective tendency of the problematic, even if it does
not go beyond a rather ordinary way of taking things. In his doctrine of the
res cogitans and the res extensa, Descartes not only wants to formulate the
problem of ‘the “I” and the world’; he claims to have solved it in a radical
manner. His Meditations make this plain. (See especially Meditations I and
VI.) By taking his basic ontological orientation from traditional sources and
not subjecting it to positive criticism, he has made it impossible to lay bare
any  primordial  ontological  problematic  of  Dasein;  this  has  inevitably
obstructed  his  view  of  the  phenomenon  of  the  world,  and  has  made  it
possible  for  the  ontology  of  the  ‘world’  to  be  compressed  into  that  of
certain  entities  within-the-world.  The  foregoing  discussion  should  have
proved this.

H. 99

 

One might retort, however, that even if in point of fact both the problem
of  the  world  and  the  Being  of  the  entities  encountered  environmentally  as
closest  to  us  remain  concealed,  Descartes  has  still  laid  the  basis  for
characterizing ontologically that entity within-the-world upon which, in its
very Being, every other entity is founded—material Nature. This would be
the fundamental stratum upon which all the other strata of actuality within-
the-world are built up. The extended Thing as such would serve, in the first
instance, as the ground for those definite characters which show themselves,
to be sure, as qualities, but which ‘at bottom’ are quantitative modifications
of  the  modes  of  the  extensio itself.  These  qualities,  which  are  themselves
reducible,  would  provide  the  footing  for  such  specific  qualities  as
“beautiful”,  “ugly”,  “in  keeping”,  “not  in  keeping,”  “useful”,  “useless”.  If
one is oriented primarily by Thinghood, these latter qualities must be taken
as  non-quantifiable  value-predicates  by  which  what  is  in  the  first  instance
just  a  material  Thing,  gets  stamped  as  something  good.  But  with  this
stratification,  we  come  to  those  entities  which  we  have  characterized
ontologically  as  equipment  ready-to-hand.  The  Cartesian  analysis  of  the

‘world’  would  thus  enable  us  for  the  first  time  to  build  up  securely  the
structure of what is proximally ready-to-hand; all it takes is to round out the
Thing  of  Nature  until  it  becomes  a  full-fledged  Thing  of  use,  and  this  is
easily done.

as 

the 

fundamental 

But  quite  apart  from  the  specific  problem  of  the  world  itself,  can  the
Being  of  what  we  encounter  proximally  within-the-world  be  reached
ontologically  by  this  procedure?  When  we  speak  of  material  Thinghood,
have we not tacitly posited a kind of Being—the constant presence-at-hand
of Things—which is so far from having been rounded out ontologically by
subsequently  endowing  entities  with  value-predicates,  that  these  value-
characters themselves are rather just ontical characteristics of those entities
which  have  the  kind  of  Being  possessed  by  Things?  Adding  on  value-
predicates cannot tell us anything at all new about the Being of goods, but
would merely presuppose again that goods have pure presence-at-hand as
their kind of Being. Values would then be determinate characteristics which
a  Thing  possesses,  and  they  would  be  present-at-hand.  They  would  have
their  sole  ultimate  ontological  source  in  our  previously  laying  down  the
even
actuality  of  Things 
prephenomenological  experience  shows  that  in  an  entity  which  is
supposedly  a  Thing,  there  is  something  that  will  not  become  fully
intelligible  through  Thinghood  alone.  Thus  the  Being  of  Things  has  to  be
rounded  out.  What,  then  does  the  Being  of  values  or  their  ‘validity’
[“Geltung”] (which Lotze took as a mode of ‘affirmation’) really amount to
ontologically?  And  what  does  it  signify  ontologically  for  Things  to  be
‘invested’ with values in this way? As long as these matters remain obscure,
to  reconstruct  the  Thing  of  use  in  terms  of  the  Thing  of  Nature  is  an
ontologically  questionable  undertaking,  even  if  one  disregards  the  way  in
which  the  problematic  has  been  perverted  in  principle.  And  if  we  are  to
reconstruct  this  Thing  of  use,  which  supposedly  comes  to  us  in  the  first
instance ‘with its skin off’, does not this always require that we previously
take a positive look at the phenomenon whose totality such a reconstruction
is to restore? But if we have not given a proper explanation beforehand of
its ownmost state of Being, are we not building our reconstruction without a
plan? Inasmuch as this reconstruction and ‘rounding-out’ of the traditional
ontology of the ‘world’ results in our reaching the same entities with which
we  started  when  we  analysed  the  readiness-to-hand  of  equipment  and  the
totality of involvements, it seems as if the Being of these entities has in fact

stratum.  But 

been clarified or has at least become a problem. But by taking extensio as a
proprietas,  Descartes  can  hardly  reach  the  Being  of  substance;  and  by
taking refuge in ‘value’-characteristics [“wertlichen” Beschaffenheiten] we
are just as far from even catching a glimpse of Being as readiness-to-hand,
let alone permitting it to become an ontological theme.

H. 100

 

Descartes has narrowed down the question of the world to that of Things
of  Nature  [Naturdinglichkeit]  as  those  entities  within-the-world  which  are
proximally accessible. He has confirmed the opinion that to know an entity
in what is supposedly the most rigorous ontical manner is our only possible
access  to  the  primary  Being  of  the  entity  which  such  knowledge  reveals.
But  at  the  same  time  we  must  have  the  insight  to  see  that  in  principle  the
‘roundings-out’  of  the  Thing-ontology  also  operate  on  the  same  dogmatic
basis as that which Descartes has adopted.

We have already intimated in Section 14 that passing over the world and
those  entities  which  we  proximally  encounter  is  not  accidental,  not  an
oversight  which  it  would  be  simple  to  correct,  but  that  it  is  grounded  in  a
kind of Being which belongs essentially to Dasein itself. When our analytic
of Dasein has given some transparency to those main structures of Dasein
which are of the most importance in the framework of this problematic, and
when we have assigned [zugewiesen] to the concept of Being in general the
horizon within which its intelligibility becomes possible, so that readiness-
to-hand  and  presence-at-hand  also  become  primordially 
intelligible
ontologically for the first time, only then can our critique of the Cartesian
ontology of the world (an ontology which, in principle, is still the usual one
today) come philosophically into its own.

To do this, we must show several things. (See Part One, Division Three.)

(1)

1. Why was the phenomenon of the world passed over at the beginning
of the ontological tradition which has been decisive for us (explicitly in the
case  of  Parmenides),  and  why  has  this  passing-over  kept  constantly
recurring?

2.  Why  is  it  that,  instead  of  the  phenomenon  thus  passed  over,  entities

within-the-world have intervened as an ontological theme?(2)

3. Why are these entities found in the first instance in ‘Nature’?

4. Why has recourse been taken to the phenomenon of value when it has

seemed necessary to round out such an ontology of the world?
 

1. This Division has never been published.
2. ‘Warum springt für das übersprungene Phänomen das innerweltlich Seiende als ontologisches
Thema ein?’ The verbal play on ‘überspringen’ (‘pass over’) and ‘einspringen’ (‘intervene’ or ‘serve
as a deputy’) is lost in translation. On ‘einspringen’ see our note 1, H. 122 below.

In  the  answers  to  these  questions  a  positive  understanding  of  the
problematic  of  the  world  will  be  reached  for  the  first  time,  the  sources  of
our failure to recognize it will be exhibited, and the ground for rejecting the
traditional ontology of the world will have been demonstrated.

H. 101

 

The world and Dasein and entities within-the-world are the ontologically
constitutive states which are closest to us; but we have no guarantee that we
can  achieve  the  basis  for  meeting  up  with  these  as  phenomena  by  the
seemingly obvious procedure of starting with the Things of the world, still
less  by  taking  our  orientation  from  what  is  supposedly  the  most  rigorous
knowledge of entities. Our observations on Descartes should have brought
us this insight.

But  if  we  recall  that  spatiality  is  manifestly  one  of  the  constituents  of
entities  within-the-world,  then  in  the  end  the  Cartesian  analysis  of  the
‘world’  can still  be ‘rescued’. When Descartes was  so radical as to  set up
the extensio  as  the  praesuppositum for  every  definite  characteristic  of  the
res  corporea,  he  prepared  the  way  for  the  understanding  of  something  a
priori whose content Kant was to establish with greater penetration. Within
certain  limits  the  analysis  of  the  extensio  remains  independent  of  his
neglecting  to  provide  an  explicit  interpretation  for  the  Being  of  extended
entities. There is some phenomenal justification for regarding the extensio
as  a  basic  characteristic  of  the  ‘world’,  even  if  by  recourse  to  this  neither
the  spatiality  of  the  world  nor  that  of  the  entities  we  encounter  in  our
environment (a spatiality which is proximally discovered) nor even that of
Dasein itself, can be conceived ontologically.

C. The Aroundness of the Environment and Dasein’s Spatiality

 

 

 

1. ‘Das Umhafte der Umwelt’. See our note 1, H. 65 above.

H. 102

In connection with our first preliminary sketch of Being-in (See Section
12), we had to contrast Dasein with a way of Being in space which we call
“insideness” [Inwendigkeit]. This expression means that an entity which is
itself extended is closed round [umschlossen] by the extended boundaries of
something  that  is  likewise  extended.  The  entity  inside  [Das  inwendig
Seiende] and that which closes it round are  both  present-at-hand  in  space.
Yet  even  if  we  deny  that  Dasein  has  any  such  insideness  in  a  spatial
receptacle, this does not in principle exclude it from having any spatiality at
all, but merely keeps open the way for seeing the kind of spatiality which is
constitutive  for  Dasein.  This  must  now  be  set  forth.  But  inasmuch  as  any
entity  within-the-world  is  likewise  in  space,  its  spatiality  will  have  an
ontological  connection  with  the  world.  We  must  therefore  determine  in
what  sense  space  is  a  constituent  for  that  world  which  has  in  turn  been
characterized as an item in the structure of Being-in-the-world. In particular
we  must  show  how  the  aroundness  of  the  environment,  the  specific
spatiality  of  entities  encountered  in  the  environment,  is  founded  upon  the
worldhood  of  the  world,  while  contrariwise  the  world,  on  its  part,  is  not
present-at-hand  in  space.  Our  study  of  Dasein’s  spatiality  and  the  way  in
which  the  world  is  spatially  determined  will  take  its  departure  from  an
analysis  of  what  is  ready-to-hand  in  space  within-the-world.  We  shall
consider three topics: 1. the spatiality of the ready-to-hand within-the-world
(Section 22); 2.  the  spatiality  of Being-in-the-world  (Section  23);  3.  space
and the spatiality of Dasein (Section 24).

22. The Spatiality of the Ready-to-hand Within-the-world

If  space  is  constitutive  for  the  world  in  a  sense  which  we  have  yet  to
determine,  then  it  cannot  surprise  us  that  in  our  foregoing  ontological
characterization  of  the  Being  of  what  is  within-the-world  we  have  had  to
look upon this as something that is also within space. This spatiality of the
ready-to-hand  is  something  which  we  have  not  yet  grasped  explicitly  as  a

phenomenon; nor have we pointed out how it is bound up with the structure
of Being which belongs to the ready-to-hand. This is now our task.

To  what  extent  has  our  characterization  of  the  ready-to-hand  already
come  up  against  its  spatiality?  We  have  been  talking  about  what  is
proximally  ready-to-hand.  This  means  not  only  those  entities  which  we
encounter  first  before  any  others,  but  also  those  which  are  ‘close  by’.(1)
What  is  ready-to-hand  in  our  everyday  dealings  has  the  character  of
closeness.  To  be  exact,  this  closeness  of  equipment  has  already  been
intimated  in  the  term  ‘readiness-to-hand’,  which  expresses  the  Being  of
equipment. Every entity that is ‘to hand’ has a different closeness, which is
not to be ascertained by measuring distances. This closeness regulates itself
in  terms  of  circumspectively  ‘calculative’  manipulating  and  using.  At  the
same time what is close in this way gets established by the circumspection
of concern, with regard to the direction in which the equipment is accessible
at  any  time.  When  this  closeness  of  the  equipment  has  been  given
directionality,(2) this signifies not merely that the equipment has its position
[Stelle] in space as present-at-hand somewhere, but also that as equipment
it  has  been  essentially  fitted  up  and  installed,  set  up,  and  put  to  rights.
Equipment  has  its  place  [Platz],  or  else  it  ‘lies  around’;  this  must  be
distinguished  in  principle  from  just  occurring  at  random  in  some  spatial
position.  When  equipment  for  something  or  other  has  its  place,  this  place
defines  itself  as  the  place  of  this  equipment—as  one  place  out  of  a  whole
totality of places directionally lined up with each other and belonging to the
context  of  equipment  that  is  environmentally  ready-to-hand.  Such  a  place
and such a muliplicity of places are not to be interpreted as the “where” of
some random Being-present-at-hand of Things. In each case the place is the
definite  ‘there’  or  ‘yonder’  [“Dort”  und  “Da”]  of  an  item  of  equipment
which belongs somewhere.
 

1. ‘in der Nähe.’ While the noun ‘Nähe’ often means the ‘closeness’ or ‘nearness’ of something
that is close to us, it can also stand for our immediate ‘vicinity’, as in the present expression, and in
many passages it can be interpreted either way. We shall in general translate it as ‘closeness’, but we
shall translate ‘in der Nähe’ and similar phrases as ‘close by’.

2. ‘Die ausgerichtete Nähe des Zeugs...’ The verb ‘ausrichten’ has many specialized meanings—
to ‘align’ a row of troops, to ‘explore’ a mine, to ‘make arrangements’ for something, to ‘carry out’ a
commission, etc. Heidegger, however, keeps its root meaning in mind and associates it with the word
‘Richtung’ (‘direction’, ‘route to be taken’, etc.). We shall accordingly translate it as a rule by some
form  of  the  verb  ‘direct’  (which  will  also  be  used  occasionally  for  the  verb  ‘richten’),  or  by  some
compound expression involving the word ‘directional’. For further discussion, see H. 108 ff. below.

H. 103

 

Its  belonging-somewhere  at  the  time  [Die  jeweilige  Hingehörigheit]
corresponds to the equipmental character of what is ready-to-hand; that is, it
corresponds  to  the  belonging-to  [Zugehörigkeit]  which  the  ready-to-hand
has  towards  a  totality  of  equipment  in  accordance  with  its  involvements.
But in general the “whither” to which the totality of places for a context of
equipment gets allotted,  is  the  underlying  condition which makes possible
the belonging-somewhere of an equipmental totality as something that can
be placed. This “whither”, which makes it possible for equipment to belong
somewhere, and which we circumspectively keep in view ahead of us in our
concernful dealings, we call the “region”.(1)

‘In the region of’ means not only ‘in the direction of’ but also within the
range [Umkreis] of something that lies in that direction. The kind of place
which is constituted by direction and remoteness(2) (and closeness is only a
mode of the latter) is already oriented towards a region and oriented within
it.  Something  like  a  region  must  first  be  discovered  if  there  is  to  be  any
possibility of allotting or coming across  places for  a totality of equipment
that  is  circumspectively  at  one’s  disposal.  The  regional  orientation  of  the
multiplicity  of  places  belonging  to  the  ready-to-hand  goes  to  make  up  the
aroundness—the  “round-about-us”  [das  Um-uns-herum]—of  those  entities
which  we  encounter  as  closest  environmentally.  A  three-dimensional
multiplicity of possible positions which gets filled up with Things present-
at-hand  is  never  proximally  given.  This  dimensionality  of  space  is  still
veiled in the spatiality of the ready-to-hand. The ‘above’ is what is ‘on the
ceiling’; the ‘below’ is what is ‘on the floor’; the ‘behind’ is what is ‘at the
door’;  all “wheres” are  discovered and circumspectively interpreted  as we
go our ways in everyday dealings; they are not ascertained and catalogued
by the observational measurement of space.
 

1.  ‘Gegend’.  There  is  no  English  word  which  quite  corresponds  to  ‘Gegend’.  ‘Region’  and
‘whereabouts’  perhaps  come  the  closest,  and  we  have  chosen  the  former  as  the  more  convenient.
(Heidegger  himself  frequently  uses  the  word  ‘Region’,  but  he  does  so  in  contexts  where  ‘realm’
seems  to  be  the  most  appropriate  translation;  we  have  usually  so  translated  it,  leaving  the  English
‘region’ for ‘Gegend’.)

2. ‘Entferntheit’. For further discussion, see Section 23 and our note 2, H. 105.

H. 104

 

Regions  are  not  first  formed  by  things  which  are  present-at-hand
together; they always are ready-to-hand already in individual places. Places
themselves either get allotted to the ready-to-hand in the circumspection of
concern, or we come across them. Thus anything constantly ready-to-hand
of which circumspective Being-in-the-world takes account beforehand, has
its place. The “where” of its readiness-to-hand is put to account as a matter
for  concern,  and  oriented  towards  the  rest  of  what  is  ready-to-hand.  Thus
the sun, whose light and warmth are in everyday use, has its own places—
sunrise,  midday,  sunset,  midnight;  these  are  discovered  in  circumspection
and treated distinctively in terms of changes in the usability of what the sun
bestows.  Here  we  have  something  which  is  ready-to-hand  with  uniform
constancy,  although  it  keeps  changing;  its  places  become  accentuated
‘indicators’ of the regions which lie in them. These celestial regions, which
need  not  have  any  geographical  meaning  as  yet,  provide  the  “whither”
beforehand  for  every(1)  special  way  of  giving  form  to  the  regions  which
places can occupy. The house has its sunny side and its shady side; the way
it is divided up into ‘rooms’ [“Räume”] is oriented towards these, and so is
the ‘arrangement’ [“Einrichtung”] within them, according to their character
as equipment. Churches and graves, for instance, are laid out according to
the  rising  and  the  setting  of  the  sun—the  regions  of  life  and  death,  which
are determinative for Dasein itself with regard to its ownmost possibilities
of Being in the world. Dasein, in its very Being, has this Being as an issue;
and  its  concern  discovers  beforehand  those  regions  in  which  some
involvement  is  decisive.  This  discovery  of  regions  beforehand  is  co-
determined  [mitbestimmt]  by  the  totality  of  involvements  for  which  the
ready-to-hand, as something encountered, is freed.

The readiness-to-hand which belongs to any such region beforehand has
the  character  of  inconspicuous  familiarity,  and  it  has  it  in  an  even  more
primordial sense than does the Being of the ready-to-hand.(2)
 

1. Reading ‘jede’ with the later editions. The earliest editions have ‘je’, which has been corrected

in the list of errata.

2.  ‘Die  vorgängige  Zuhandenheit  der  jeweiligen  Gegend  hat  in  einem  noch  ursprünglicheren
Sinne als das Sein des Zuhandenen den Charakter  der  unauffälligen  Vertrautheit.’ Here  the  phrase
‘als  das  Sein  des  Zuhandenen’  is  ambiguously  placed.  In  the  light  of  Section  16  above,  we  have
interpreted ‘als’ as ‘than’ rather than ‘as’, and have treated ‘das Sein’ as a nominative rather than an
accusative. But other readings are grammatically just as possible.

The  region  itself  becomes  visible  in  a  conspicuous  manner  only  when
one  discovers  the  ready-to-hand  circumspectively  and  does  so  in  the
deficient modes of concern.(1) Often the region of a place does not become
accessible explicitly as such a region until one fails to find something in its
place. The space which is discovered in circumspective Being-in-the-world
as  the  spatiality  of  the  totality  of  equipment,  always  belongs  to  entities
themselves as the place of that totality. The bare space itself is still veiled
over.  Space  has  been  split  up  into  places.  But  this  spatiality  has  its  own
unity  through  that  totality-of-involvements  in-accordance-with-the-world
[weltmässige]  which  belongs 
ready-to-hand.  The
‘environment’  does  not  arrange  itself  in  a  space  which  has  been  given  in
advance;  but  its  specific  worldhood,  in  its  significance,  Articulates  the
context  of  involvements  which  belongs  to  some  current  totality  of
circumspectively  allotted  places.  The  world  at  such  a  time  always  reveals
the  spatiality  of  the  space  which  belongs  to  it.  To  encounter  the  ready-to-
hand  in  its  environmental  space  remains  ontically  possible  only  because
Dasein itself is ‘spatial’ with regard to its Being-in-the-world.

23. The Spatiality of Being-in-the-world

 

 

H. 105

If  we  attribute  spatiality  to  Dasein,  then  this  ‘Being  in  space’  must
manifestly  be  conceived  in  terms  of  the  kind  of  Being  which  that  entity
possesses.  Dasein  is  essentially  not  a  Being-present-at-hand;  and  its
“spatiality” cannot signify anything like occurrence at a position in ‘world-
space’, nor can it signify Being-ready-to-hand at some place. Both of these
are  kinds  of  Being  which  belong  to  entities  encountered  within-the-world.
Dasein,  however,  is  ‘in’  the  world  in  the  sense  that  it  deals  with  entities
encountered  within-the-world,  and  does  so  concernfully  and  with
familiarity.  So  if  spatiality  belongs  to  it  in  any  way,  that  is  possible  only
because  of  this  Being-in.  But  its  spatiality  shows  the  characters  of  de-
severance and directionality.(2)
 

1. ‘Sie wird selbst nur sichtbar in der Weise des Auffallens bei einem umsichtigen Entdecken des
Zuhandenen und zwar in den defizienten Modi des Besorgens.’ This sentence too is ambiguous. The
pronoun  ‘Sie’  may  refer  either  to  the  region,  as  we  have  suggested,  or  to  its  readiness-to-hand.

Furthermore, while we have taken ‘nur sichtbar in der Weise des Auffallens’ as a unit, it is possible
that ‘in der Weise des Auffallens’ should be construed as going with the words that follow. In this
case  we  should  read:  ‘...becomes  visible  only  when  it  becomes  conspicuous  in  our  circumspective
discovery of the ready-to-hand, and indeed in the deficient modes of concern.’

2.  ‘Ent-fernung  und  Ausrichtung.’  The  nouns  ‘Entfernung’  and  ‘Entfernheit’  can  usually  be
translated  by  ‘removing’,  ‘removal’,  ‘remoteness’,  or  even  ‘distance’.  In  this  passage,  however,
Heidegger is calling attention to the fact that these words are derived from the stem ‘fern-’ (‘far’ or
‘distant’)  and  the  privative  prefix  ‘ent-’.  Usually  this  prefix  would  be  construed  as  merely
intensifying the notion of separation or distance expressed in the ‘fern-’; but Heidegger chooses to
construe it as more strictly privative, so that the verb ‘entfernen’ will be taken to mean abolishing a
distance or farness rather than enhancing it. It is as if by the very act of recognizing the ‘remoteness’
of something, we have in a sense brought it closer and made it less ‘remote’.

Apparently  there  is  no  word  in  English  with  an  etymological  structure  quite  parallel  to  that  of
‘entfernen’;  perhaps  ‘dissever’  comes  the  nearest,  for  this  too  is  a  verb  of  separation  in  which  a
privative prefix is used as an intensive. We have coined the similar verb ‘desever’ in the hope that
this  will  suggest  Heidegger’s  meaning  when  ‘remove’  and  its  derivatives  seem  inappropriate.  But
with ‘desever’, one cannot slip back and forth from one sense to another as easily as one can with
‘entfernen’;  so  we  have  resorted  to  the  expedient  of  using  both  ‘desever’  and  ‘remove’  and  their
derivatives,  depending  upon  the  sense  we  feel  is  intended.  Thus  ‘entfernen’  will  generally  be
rendered by ‘remove’ or ‘desever’, ‘entfernt’ by ‘remote’ or ‘desevered’. Since Heidegger is careful
to distinguish ‘Entfernung’ and ‘Entferntheit’, we shall usually translate these by ‘deseverance’ and
‘remoteness’ respectively; in the few cases where these translations do not seem appropriate, we shall
subjoin the German word in brackets.

Our  problem  is  further  complicated  by  Heidegger’s  practise  of  occasionally  putting  a  hyphen
after the prefix ‘ent-’, presumably to emphasize its privative character. In such cases we shall write
‘de-sever’,  ‘de-severance’,  etc.  Unfortunately,  however,  there  are  typographical  discrepancies
between the earlier and later editions. Some of the earlier hyphens occur at the ends of lines and have
been either intentionally or inadvertently omitted in resetting the type; some appear at the end of the
line  in  the  later  editions,  but  not  in  the  earlier  ones;  others  have  this  position  in  both  editions.  We
shall indicate each of these ambiguous cases with an asterisk, supplying a hyphen only if there seems
to be a good reason for doing so.

On ‘Ausrichtung’ see our note 2, H. 102 above.

When  we  speak  of  deseverance  as  a  kind  of  Being  which  Dasein  has
with regard to its Being-in-the-world, we do not understand by it any such
thing  as  remoteness  (or  closeness)  or  even  a  distance.(1)  We  use  the
expression  “deseverance”*  in  a  signification  which  is  both  active  and
transitive. It stands for a constitutive state of Dasein’s Being—a state with
regard to which removing something in the sense of putting it away is only
a determinate factical mode. “De-severing”* amounts to making the farness
vanish—that is, making the remoteness of something disappear, bringing it
close.(2) Dasein is essentially de-severant: it lets any entity be encountered
close by as the entity which it is. De-severance discovers remoteness; and
remoteness,  like  distance,  is  a  determinate  categorial  characteristic  of
entities whose nature is not that of Dasein. De-severance*, however, is an

existentiale; this  must  be  kept  in  mind.  Only  to  the  extent  that  entities  are
revealed for Dasein in their deseveredness [Entferntheit], do ‘remotenesses’
[“Entfernungen”]  and  distances  with  regard  to  other  things  become
accessible  in  entities  within-the-world  themselves.  Two  points  are  just  as
little desevered from one another as two Things, for neither of these types
of entity has the kind of Being which would make it capable of desevering.
They merely have a measurable distance between them, which we can come
across in our de-severing.

Proximally  and  for  the  most  part,  de-severing(3)  is  a  circumspective
bringing-close—bringing  something  close  by,  in  the  sense  of  procuring  it,
putting it in readiness, having it to hand. But certain ways in which entities
are  discovered  in  a  purely  cognitive  manner  also  have  the  character  of
bringing  them  close.  In  Dasein  there  lies  an  essential  tendency  towards
closeness. All the ways in which we speed things up, as we are more or less
compelled  to  do  today,  push  us  on  towards  the  conquest  of  remoteness.
With  the  ‘radio’,  for  example,  Dasein  has  so  expanded  its  everyday
environment that it has accomplished a de-severance of the ‘world’—a de-
severance which, in its meaning for Dasein, cannot yet be visualized.
 

1. ‘Abstand’. Heidegger uses three words which might be translated as ‘distance’: ‘Ferne’ (our
‘farness’), ‘Entfernung’ (our ‘deseverance’), and ‘Abstand’ (‘distance’ in the sense of a measurable
interval). We shall reserve ‘distance’ for ‘Abstand’.

2.  ‘Entfernen*  besagt  ein  Verschwindenmachen  der  Ferne,  d.  h.  der  Entferntheit  von  etwas,

3. This hyphen is found only in the later editions.

Näherung.’

H. 106

 

De-severing  does  not  necessarily  imply  any  explicit  estimation  of  the
farness  of  something  ready-to-hand  in  relation  to  Dasein.  Above  all,
remoteness* never gets taken as a distance. If farness is to be estimated, this
is  done  relatively  to  deseverances  in  which  everyday  Dasein  maintains
itself.  Though  these  estimates  may  be  imprecise  and  variable  if  we  try  to
compute  them,  in  the  everydayness  of  Dasein  they  have  their  own
definiteness which is thoroughly intelligible. We say that to go over yonder
is “a good walk”, “a stone’s throw”, or ‘as long as it takes to smoke a pipe’.
These  measures  express  not  only  that  they  are  not  intended  to  ‘measure’
anything  but  also  that  the  remoteness*  here  estimated  belongs  to  some
entity  to  which  one  goes  with  concernful  circumspection.  But  even  when

are 

estimated 

proximally 

we  avail  ourselves  of  a  fixed  measure  and  say  ‘it  is  half  an  hour  to  the
house’,  this  measure  must  be  taken  as  an  estimate.  ‘Half  an  hour’  is  not
thirty  minutes,  but  a  duration  [Dauer]  which  has  no  ‘length’  at  all  in  the
sense  of  a  quantitative  stretch.  Such  a  duration  is  always  interpreted  in
terms  of  well-accustomed  everyday  ways  in  which  we  ‘make  provision’
by
[“Besorgungen”].  Remotenesses* 
circumspection, even when one is quite familiar with ‘officially’ calculated
measures.  Since  what  is  de-severed  in  such  estimates  is  ready-to-hand,  it
retains its character as specifically within-the-world. This even implies that
the  pathways  we  take  towards  desevered  entities  in  the  course  of  our
dealings will vary in their length from day to day. What is ready-to-hand in
the  environment  is  certainly  not  present-at-hand  for  an  eternal  observer
exempt  from  Dasein:  but  it  is  encountered  in  Dasein’s  circumspectively
concernful  everydayness.  As  Dasein  goes  along  its  ways,  it  does  not
measure  off  a  stretch  of  space  as  a  corporeal  Thing  which  is  present-at-
hand; it does not ‘devour the kilometres’; bringing-close or de-severance is
always  a  kind  of  concernful  Being  towards  what  is  brought  close  and  de-
severed.  A  pathway  which  is  long  ‘Objectively’  can  be  much  shorter  than
one  which  is  ‘Objectively’  shorter  still  but  which  is  perhaps  ‘hard  going’
and  comes  before  us(1)  as  interminably  long.  Yet  only  in  thus  ‘coming
before  us’(1)  is  the  current  world  authentically  ready-to-hand.  The
Objective  distances  of  Things  present-at-hand  do  not  coincide  with  the
remoteness  and  closeness  of  what  is  ready-to-hand  within-the-world.
Though we may know these distances exactly, this knowledge still remains
blind;  it  does  not  have  the  function  of  discovering  the  environment
circumspectively and bringing it close; this knowledge is used only in and
for a concernful Being which does not measure stretches—a Being towards
the world that ‘matters’ to one [...Sein zu der einen “angehenden” Welt].

When  one  is  oriented  beforehand  towards  ‘Nature’  and  ‘Objectively’
measured distances of Things, one is inclined to pass off such estimates and
interpretations of deseverance as ‘subjective’. Yet this ‘subjectivity’ perhaps
uncovers  the  ‘Reality’  of  the  world  at  its  most  Real;  it  has  nothing  to  do
with  ‘subjective’  arbitrariness  or  subjectivistic  ‘ways  of  taking’  an  entity
which  ‘in  itself’  is  otherwise.  The  circumspective  de-severing  of  Dasein’s
everydayness  reveals  the  Being-in-itself  of  the  ‘true  world’—of  that  entity
which Dasein, as something existing, is already alongside.(2)

be thought of as applicable strictly to the present-at-hand. In this passage, however, it is applied to
the  ready-to-hand;  and  a  translation  which  calls  attention  to  its  etymological  structure  seems  to  be
called for.

H. 107

 

When  one 

is  primarily  and  even  exclusively  oriented 

towards
remotenesses as measured distances, the primordial spatiality of Being-in is
concealed. That which is presumably ‘closest’ is by no means that which is
at  the  smallest  distance  ‘from  us’.  It  lies  in  that  which  is  desevered  to  an
average extent when we reach for it, grasp it, or look at it. Because Dasein
is  essentially  spatial  in  the  way  of  de-severance,  its  dealings  always  keep
within  an  ‘environment’  which  is  desevered  from  it  with  a  certain  leeway
[Spielraum];  accordingly  our  seeing  and  hearing  always  go  proximally
beyond what is distantially ‘closest’. Seeing and hearing are distance-senses
[Fernsinne] not because they are far-reaching, but because it is in them that
Dasein as deseverant mainly dwells. When, for instance, a man wears a pair
of spectacles which are so close to him distantially that they are ‘sitting on
his nose’, they are environmentally more remote from him than the picture
on the opposite wall. Such equipment has so little closeness that often it is
proximally  quite  impossible  to  find.  Equipment  for  seeing—and  likewise
for  hearing,  such  as  the  telephone  receiver—has  what  we  have  designated
as  the  inconspicuousness  of  the  proximally  ready-to-hand.  So  too,  for
instance, does the street, as equipment for walking. One feels the touch of it
at every step as one walks; it is seemingly the closest and Realest of all that
is  ready-to-hand,  and  it  slides  itself;  as  it  were,  along  certain  portions  of
one’s  body—the  soles  of  one’s  feet.  And  yet  it  is  farther  remote  than  the
acquaintance  whom  one  encounters  ‘on  the  street’  at  a  ‘remoteness’
[“Entfernung”]  of  twenty  paces  when  one  is  taking  such  a  walk.
Circumspective concern decides as to the closeness and farness of what is
proximally  ready-to-hand  environmentally.  Whatever  this  concern  dwells
alongside  beforehand  is  what  is  closest,  and  this  is  what  regulates  our  de-
severances.

If Dasein, in its concern, brings something close by, this does not signify
that  it  fixes  something  at  a  spatial  position  with  a  minimal  distance  from
some  point  of  the  body.  When  something  is  close  by,  this  means  that  it  is

within  the  range  of  what  is  proximally  ready-to-hand  for  circumspection.
Bringing-close is not oriented towards the I-Thing encumbered with a body,
but  towards  concernful  Being-in-the-world—that  is,  towards  whatever  is
proximally  encountered  in  such  Being.  It  follows,  moreover,  that  Dasein’s
spatiality is not to be defined by citing the position at which some corporeal
Thing  is  present-at-hand.  Of  course  we  say  that  even  Dasein  always
occupies  a  place.  But  this  ‘occupying’  must  be  distinguished  in  principle
from Being-ready-to-hand at a place in some particular region. Occupying a
place  must  be  conceived  as  a  desevering  of  the  environmentally  ready-to-
hand into a region which has been circumspectively discovered in advance.
Dasein understands its “here” [Hier] in terms of its environmental “yonder”.
The  “here”  does  not  mean  the  “where”  of  something  present-at-hand,  but
rather  the  “whereat”  [Wobei]  of  a  de-severant  Being-alongside,  together
with  this  de-severance.  Dasein,  in  accordance  with  its  spatiality,  is
proximally never here but yonder; from this “yonder” it comes back to its
“here”; and it comes back to its “here” only in the way in which it interprets
its concernful Being-towards in terms of what is ready-to-hand yonder. This
becomes quite plain if we consider a certain phenomenal peculiarity of the
de-severance structure of Being-in.

H. 108

 

As  Being-in-the-world,  Dasein  maintains  itself  essentially  in  a  de-
severing. This de-severance—the farness of the ready-to-hand from Dasein
itself—is  something  that  Dasein  can  never  cross  over.  Of  course  the
remoteness  of  something  ready-to-hand  from  Dasein  can  show  up  as  a
distance  from  it,(1)  if  this  remoteness  is  determined  by  a  relation  to  some
Thing  which  gets  thought  of  as  present-at-hand  at  the  place  Dasein  has
formerly occupied. Dasein can subsequently traverse the “between” of this
distance, but only in such a way that the distance itself becomes one which
has been desevered*. So little has Dasein crossed over its de-severance that
it has rather taken it along with it and keeps doing so constantly; for Dasein
is  essentially  de-severance—that  is,  it  is  spatial.  It  cannot  wander  about
within  the  current  range  of  its  de-severances;  it  can  never  do  more  than
change  them.  Dasein  is  spatial  in  that  it  discovers  space  circumspectively,
so  that  indeed  it  constantly  comports  itself  de-severantly*  towards  the
entities thus spatially encountered.

 

 

1. ‘...kann zwar selbst von diesem als Abstand vorfindlich werden...’

likewise 

As  de-severant  Being-in,  Dasein  has 

the  character  of
directionality.  Every  bringing-close  [Näherung]  has  already  taken  in
advance a direction towards a region out of which what is de-severed brings
itself  close  [sich  nähert],  so  that  one  can  come  across  it  with  regard  to  its
place. Circumspective concern is de-severing which gives directionality. In
this concern—that is, in the Being-in-the-world of Dasein itself—a supply
of  ‘signs’  is  presented.  Signs,  as  equipment,  take  over  the  giving  of
directions  in  a  way  which  is  explicit  and  easily  manipulable.  They  keep
explicitly open those regions which have been used circumspectively—the
particular “whithers” to which something belongs or goes, or gets brought
or fetched. If Dasein is, it already has, as directing and desevering, its own
discovered  region.  Both  directionality  and  de-severance,  as  modes  of
Being-in-the-world,  are  guided  beforehand  by  the  circumspection  of
concern.

H. 109

Out  of  this  directionality  arise  the  fixed  directions  of  right  and  left.
Dasein constantly takes these directions along with it, just as it does its de-
severances. Dasein’s spatialization in its ‘bodily nature’ is likewise marked
out in accordance with these directions. (This ‘bodily nature’ hides a whole
problematic of its own, though we shall not treat it here.) Thus things which
are ready-to-hand and used for the body—like gloves, for example, which
are to move with the hands—must be given directionality towards right and
left.  A  craftsman’s  tools,  however,  which  are  held  in  the  hand  and  are
moved with it, do not share the hand’s specifically ‘manual’ [“handliche”]
movements. So although hammers are handled just as much with the hand
as gloves are, there are no right- or left-handed hammers.

One  must  notice,  however,  that  the  directionality  which  belongs  to  de-
severance  is  founded  upon  Being-in-the-world.  Left  and  right  are  not
something  ‘subjective’  for  which  the  subject  has  a  feeling;  they  are
directions of one’s directedness into a world that is ready-to-hand already.
‘By  the  mere  feeling  of  a  difference  between  my  two  sides’(xxi)  I  could
never find my way about in a world. The subject with a ‘mere feeling’ of

this  difference  is  a  construct  posited  in  disregard  of  the  state  that  is  truly
constitutive  for  any  subject—namely,  that  whenever  Dasein  has  such  a
‘mere feeling’, it is in a world already and must be in it to be able to orient
itself at all. This becomes plain from the example with which Kant tries to
clarify the phenomenon of orientation.

Suppose I step into a room which is familiar to me but dark, and which
has  been  rearranged  [umgeräumt]  during  my  absence  so  that  everything
which used to be at my right is now at my left. If I am to orient myself the
‘mere feeling of the difference’ between my two sides will be of no help at
all as long as I fail to apprehend some definite object ‘whose position’, as
Kant remarks casually, ‘I have in mind’. But what does this signify except
that whenever this happens I necessarily orient myself both  i n  and  f r o m
 my being already alongside a world which is ‘familiar’?(1) The equipment-
context of a world must have been presented to Dasein. That I am already in
a world is  no less constitutive  for  the  possibility of orientation than  is  the
feeling for right and left. While this state of Dasein’s Being is an obvious
one,  we  are  not  thereby  justified  in  suppressing  the  ontologically
constitutive role which it plays. Even Kant does not suppress it, any more
than  any  other  Interpretation  of  Dasein.  Yet  the  fact  that  this  is  a  state  of
which  we  constantly  make  use,  does  not  exempt  us  from  providing  a
suitable ontological explication, but rather demands one. The psychological
Interpretation  according  to  which  the  “I”  has  something  ‘in  the  memory’
[“im  Gedächtnis”]  is  at  bottom  a  way  of  alluding  to  the  existentially
constitutive  state  of  Being-in-the-world.  Since  Kant  fails  to  see  this
structure,  he  also  fails  to  recognize  all  the  interconnections  which  the
Constitution  of  any  possible  orientation  implies.  Directedness  with  regard
to  right  and  left  is  based  upon  the  essential  directionality  of  Dasein  in
general,  and  this  directionality  in  turn  is  essentially  co-determined  by
Being-in-the-world.  Even  Kant,  of  course,  has  not  taken  orientation  as  a
theme  for  Interpretation.  He  merely  wants  to  show  that  every  orientation
requires  a ‘subjective  principle’.  Here  ‘subjective’ is  meant  to  signify  that

this  principle  is  a  priori.(2)  Nevertheless,  the  a  priori  character  of
directedness  with  regard  to  right  and  left  is  based  upon  the  ‘subjective’  a
priori of Being-in-the-world, which has nothing to do with any determinate
character restricted beforehand to a worldless subject.

De-severance and directionality, as constitutive characteristics of Being-
in, are determinative for Dasein’s spatiality—for its being concernfully and
circumspectively  in  space,  in  a  space  discovered  and  within-the-world.
Only  the  explication  we  have  just  given  for  the  spatiality  of  the  ready-to-
hand within-the-world and the spatiality of Being-in-the-world, will provide
the prerequisites for working out the phenomenon of the world’s spatiality
and formulating the ontological problem of space.

for ‘sein’.

omit the colon, making the passage ambiguous.

24. Space and Dasein’s Spatiality

As  Being-in-the-world,  Dasein  has  already  discovered  a  ‘world’  at  any
time. This discovery, which is founded upon the worldhood of the world, is
one  which  we  have  characterized  as  freeing  entities  for  a  totality  of
involvements. Freeing something and letting it be involved, is accomplished
by way of referring or assigning oneself circumspectively, and this in turn is
based  upon  one’s  previously  understanding  significance.  We  have  now
shown that circumspective Being-in-the-world is spatial. And only because
Dasein is spatial in the way of de-severance and directionality can what is
ready-to-hand  within-the-world  be  encountered  in  its  spatiality.  To  free  a
totality of involvements is, equiprimordially, to let something be involved at
a region, and to do so by de-severing and giving directionality; this amounts
to  freeing  the  spatial  belonging-somewhere  of  the  ready-to-hand.  In  that
significance with which Dasein (as concernful Being-in) is familiar, lies the
essential co-disclosedness of space.(1)

H. 111

 

 

The space which is thus disclosed with the worldhood of the world still
lacks  the  pure  multiplicity  of  the  three  dimensions.  In  this  disclosedness
which is closest to us, space, as the pure “wherein” in which positions are
ordered  by  measurement  and  the  situations  of  things  are  determined,  still
remains hidden. In the phenomenon of the region we have already indicated
that on the basis of which space is discovered beforehand in Dasein. By a
‘region” we have understood the “whither” to which an equipment-context
ready-to-hand  might  possibly  belong,  when  that  context  is  of  such  a  sort
that  it  can  be  encountered  as  directionally  desevered—that  is,  as  having
been placed.(2) This belongingness [Gehörigkeit] is determined in terms of
the  significance  which  is  constitutive  for  the  world,  and  it  Articulates  the
“hither”  and  “thither”  within  the  possible  “whither”.  In  general  the
“whither” gets prescribed by a referential totality which has been made fast
in a “for-the-sake-of-which” of concern, and within which letting something
be  involved  by  freeing  it,  assigns  itself.  With  anything  encountered  as
ready-to-hand  there  is  always  an  involvement  in  [bei]  a  region.  To  the
totality  of  involvements  which  makes  up  the  Being  of  the  ready-to-hand
within-the-world,  there  belongs  a  spatial  involvement  which  has  the
character of a region. By reason of such an involvement, the ready-to-hand
becomes  something  which  we  can  come  across  and  ascertain  as  having
form and direction.(3) With the factical Being of Dasein, what is ready-to-
hand  within-the-world  is  desevered*  and  given  directionality,  depending
upon 
is  possible  for  concernful
circumspection.

2.  ‘Wir  verstehen  sie  als  das  Wohin  der  möglichen  Zugehörigkeit  des  zuhandenen

Zeugzusammenhanges, der als ausgerichtet entfernter, d. h. platzierter soll begegnen können.’

3.  ‘Auf  deren  Grunde  wird  das  Zuhandene  nach  Form  und  Richtung  vorfindlich  und
bestimmbar’. The earliest editions have ‘erfindlich’, which has been corrected to ‘vorfindlich’ in a
list of errata.

When we let entities within-the-world be encountered in the way which
is  constitutive  for  Being-in-the-world,  we  ‘give  them  space’.  This  ‘giving
space’,  which  we  also  call  ‘making room’ for  them,(1)  consists  in  freeing
the ready-to-hand for its spatiality. As a way of discovering and presenting
a possible totality of spaces determined by involvements, this making-room
is what makes possible one’s factical orientation at the time. In concerning
itself  circumspectively  with  the  world,  Dasein  can  move  things  around  or

out of the way or ‘make room’ for them [um-, weg-, und “einräumen”] only
because  making-room—understood  as  an  existentiale—belongs  to  its
Being-in-the-world.  But  neither  the  region  previously  discovered  nor  in
general  the  current  spatiality  is  explicitly  in  view.  In  itself  it  is  present
[zugegen]  for  circumspection  in  the  inconspicuousness  of  those  ready-to-
hand  things  in  which  that  circumspection  is  concernfully  absorbed.  With
Being-in-the-world, space is proximally discovered in this spatiality. On the
basis  of  the  spatiality  thus  discovered,  space  itself  becomes  accessible  for
cognition.
 

1. Both ‘Raum-geben’ (our ‘giving space’) and ‘Einräumen’ (our ‘making room’) are often used
in the metaphorical sense of ‘yielding’, ‘granting’, or ‘making concessions’. ‘Einräumen’ may also
be used for ‘arranging’ furniture, ‘moving it in’, or ‘stowing it away’.

Space is not in the subject, nor is the world in space. Space is rather ‘in’
the world in so far as space has been disclosed by that Being-in-the-world
which is constitutive for Dasein. Space is not to be found in the subject, nor
does the subject observe the world ‘as if’ that world were in a space; but the
‘subject’ (Dasein), if well understood ontologically, is spatial. And because
Dasein  is  spatial  in  the  way  we  have  described,  space  shows  itself  as  a
priori.  This  term  does  not  mean  anything  like  previously  belonging  to  a
subject which is proximally still worldless and which emits a space out of
itself. Here “apriority” means the previousness with which space has been
encountered  (as  a  region)  whenever  the  ready-to-hand  is  encountered
environmentally.

H. 112

 

The  spatiality  of  what  we  proximally  encounter  in  circumspection  can
become a theme for circumspection itself, as well as a task for calculation
and measurement, as in building and surveying. Such thematization of the
spatiality of the environment is still predominantly an act of circumspection
by which space in itself already comes into view in a certain way. The space
which thus shows itself can be studied purely by looking at it, if one gives
up  what  was  formerly  the  only  possibility  of  access  to  it—circumspective
calculation.  When  space  is  ‘intuited  formally’,  the  pure  possibilities  of
spatial relations are discovered. Here one may go through a series of stages
in laying bare pure homogeneous space, passing from the pure morphology

of spatial shapes to analysis situs and finally to the purely metrical science
of  space.  In  our  present  study  we  shall  not  consider  how  all  these  are
interconnected.(xxii)  Our  problematic  is  merely  designed  to  establish
ontologically the phenomenal basis upon which one can take the discovery
of pure space as a theme for investigation, and work it out.

When space is discovered non-circumspectively by just looking at it, the
environmental  regions  get  neutralized  to  pure  dimensions.  Places—and
indeed the  whole circumspectively oriented  totality of places belonging to
equipment  ready-to-hand—get  reduced  to  a  multiplicity  of  positions  for
random  Things.  The  spatiality  of  what  is  ready-to-hand  within-the-world
loses  its  involvement-character,  and  so  does  the  ready-to-hand.  The  world
loses its specific aroundness; the environment becomes the world of Nature.
The ‘world’, as a totality of equipment ready-to-hand, becomes spatialized
[verräumlicht]  to  a  context  of  extended  Things  which  are  just  present-at-
hand  and  no  more.  The  homogeneous  space  of  Nature  shows  itself  only
when  the  entities  we  encounter  are  discovered  in  such  a  way  that  the
worldly  character  of  the  ready-to-hand  gets  specifically  deprived  of  its
worldhood.(1)

H. 113

In  accordance  with  its  Being-in-the-world,  Dasein  always  has  space
presented  as  already  discovered,  though  not  thematically.  On  the  other
hand, space in itself, so far as it embraces the mere possibilities of the pure
spatial  Being  of  something,  remains  proximally  still  concealed.  The  fact
that space essentially shows itself in a world is not yet decisive for the kind
of  Being  which  it  possesses.  It  need  not  have  the  kind  of  Being
characteristic  of  something  which  is  itself  spatially  ready-to-hand  or
present-at-hand. Nor does the Being of space have the kind of Being which
belongs to Dasein. Though the Being of space itself cannot be conceived as
the kind of Being which belongs to a res extensa, it does not follow that it

must  be  defined  ontologically  as  a  ‘phenomenon’  of  such  a  res.  (In  its
Being,  it  would  not  be  distinguished  from  such  a  res.) Nor  does  it  follow
that  the  Being  of  space  can  be  equated  to  that  of  the  res  cogitans  and
conceived  as  merely  ‘subjective’,  quite  apart  from  the  questionable
character of the Being of such a subject.

The  Interpretation  of  the  Being  of  space  has  hitherto  been  a  matter  of
perplexity,  not  so  much  because  we  have  been  insufficiently  acquainted
with  the  content  of  space  itself  as  a  thing  [des  Sachgehaltes  des  Raumes
selbst],  as  because  the  possibilities  of  Being  in  general  have  not  been  in
principle transparent, and an Interpretation of them in terms of ontological
concepts has been lacking. If we are to understand the ontological problem
of  space,  it  is  of  decisive  importance  that  the  question  of  Being  must  be
liberated  from  the  narrowness  of  those  concepts  of  Being  which  merely
chance to be available and which are for the most part rather rough; and the
problematic  of  the  Being  of  space  (with  regard  to  that  phenomenon  itself
and various phenomenal spatialities) must be turned in such a direction as
to clarify the possibilities of Being in general.

In  the  phenomenon  of  space  the  primary  ontological  character  of  the
Being of entities within-the-world is not to be found, either as unique or as
one  among  others.  Still  less  does  space  constitute  the  phenomenon  of  the
world. Unless we go back to the world, space cannot be conceived. Space
becomes  accessible  only  if  the  environment  is  deprived  of  its  worldhood;
and  spatiality  is  not  discoverable  at  all  except  on  the  basis  of  the  world.
Indeed space is still one of the things that is constitutive for the world, just
as  Dasein’s  own  spatiality  is  essential  to  its  basic  state  of  Being-in-the-
world.(1)

IV: BEING-IN-THE-WORLD AS BEING-WITH AND BEING-

ONE’S-SELF. THE “THEY”

 

 

H. 114

OUR  analysis  of  the  worldhood  of  the  world  has  constantly  been
bringing the whole phenomenon of Being-in-the-world into view, although
its  constitutive  items  have  not  all  stood  out  with  the  same  phenomenal
distinctness as the phenomenon of the world itself. We have Interpreted the
world  ontologically  by  going  through  what  is  ready-to-hand  within-the-
world;  and  this  Interpretation  has  been  put  first,  because  Dasein,  in  its
everydayness  (with  regard  to  which  Dasein  remains  a  constant  theme  for
study),  not  only  is  in  a  world  but  comports  itself  towards  that  world  with
one predominant kind of Being. Proximally and for the most part Dasein is
fascinated with its world. Dasein is thus absorbed in the world; the kind of
Being which it thus possesses, and in general the Being-in which underlies
it, are essential in determining the character of a phenomenon which we are
now about to study. We shall approach this phenomenon by asking who it is
that Dasein is in its everydayness. All the structures of Being which belong
to Dasein, together with the phenomenon which provides the answer to this
question  of  the  “who”,  are  ways  of  its  Being.  To  characterize  these
ontologically is to do so existentially. We must therefore pose the question
correctly  and  outline  the  procedure  for  bringing  into  view  a  broader
phenomenal domain of Dasein’s everydayness. By directing our researches
towards  the  phenomenon  which  is  to  provide  us  with  an  answer  to  the
question of the “who”, we shall be led to certain structures of Dasein which
are  equiprimordial  with  Being-in-the-world:  Being-with  and  Dasein-with
[Mitsein  und  Mitdasein].  In  this  kind  of  Being  is  grounded  the  mode  of
everyday  Being-one’s-Self  [Selbstsein];  the  explication  of  this  mode  will
enable  us  to  see  what  we  may  call  the  ‘subject’  of  everydayness—the
“they”. Our chapter on the ‘who’ of the average Dasein will thus be divided
up  as  follows:  1.  an  approach  to  the  existential  question  of  the  “who”  of
Dasein (Section 25); 2. the Dasein-with of Others, and everyday Being-with
(Section 26); 3. everyday Being-one’s-Self and the “they” (Section 27).

 

 

1.  ‘Das  Man’.  In  German  one  may  write  ‘man  glaubt’  where  in  French  one  would  write  ‘on
croit’, or in English ‘they believe’, ‘one believes’, or ‘it is believed’. But the German ‘man’ and the
French ‘on’ are specialized for such constructions in a way in which the pronouns ‘they’, ‘one’, and
‘it’ are not. There is accordingly no single idiomatic translation for the German ‘man’ which will not
sometimes lend itself to ambiguity, and in general we have chosen whichever construction seems the
most appropriate in its context. But when Heidegger introduces this word with a definite article and
writes  ‘das  Man’,  as  he  does  very  often  in  this  chapter,  we  shall  translate  this  expression  as  ‘the
“they” ’, trusting that the reader will not take this too literally.

25. An Approach to the Existential Question of the “Who” of Dasein

The answer to the question of who Dasein is, is one that was seemingly
given in Section 9, where we indicated formally the basic characteristics of
Dasein. Dasein is  an entity which is  in  each case  I  myself; its Being  is  in
each case mine. This definition indicates an ontologically constitutive state,
but it does no more than indicate it. At the same time this tells us ontically
(though in a rough and ready fashion) that in each case an “I”—not Others
—is this entity. The question of the “who” answers itself in terms of the “I”
itself,  the  ‘subject’,  the  ‘Self’.(1)  The  “who”  is  what  maintains  itself  as
something  identical  throughout  changes  in  its  Experiences  and  ways  of
behaviour, and which relates itself to this changing multiplicity in so doing.
Ontologically we understand it as something which is in each case already
constantly present-at-hand, both in and for a closed realm, and which lies at
the basis, in a very special sense, as the subjectum. As something selfsame
in manifold otherness,(2) it has the character of the Self. Even if one rejects
the “soul substance” and the Thinghood of consciousness, or denies that a
person  is  an  object,  ontologically  one  is  still  positing  something  whose
Being retains the meaning of present-at-hand, whether it does so explicitly
or not. Substantiality is the ontological clue for determining which entity is
to  provide  the  answer  to  the  question  of  the  “who”.  Dasein  is  tacitly
conceived in advance as something present-at-hand. This meaning of Being
is  always  implicated  in  any  case  where  the  Being  of  Dasein  has  been  left
indefinite.  Yet  presence-at-hand  is  the  kind  of  Being  which  belongs  to
entities whose character is not that of Dasein.
 

1. ‘dem “Selbst” ’. While we shall ordinarily translate the intensive ‘selbst’ by the corresponding
English  intensives  ‘itself’,  ‘oneself’,  ‘myself’,  etc.,  according  to  the  context,  we  shall  translate  the
substantive ‘Selbst’ by the substantive ‘Self’ with a capital.

2. ‘…als Selbiges in der vielfältigen Andersheit…’ While the words ‘identisch’ and ‘selbig’ are
virtually  synonyms  in  ordinary  German,  Heidegger  seems  to  be  intimating  a  distinction  between
them. We shall accordingly translate the former by ‘identical’ and the latter by ‘selfsame’ to show its
etymological connection with ‘selbst’. Cf. H. 130 below.

H. 115

 

The assertion that it is I who in each case Dasein is, is ontically obvious;
but this must not mislead us into supposing that the route for an ontological
Interpretation  of  what  is  ‘given’  in  this  way  has  thus  been  unmistakably
prescribed.  Indeed  it  remains  questionable  whether  even  the  mere  ontical
content  of  the  above  assertion  does  proper  justice  to  the  stock  of
phenomena  belonging  to  everyday  Dasein.  It  could  be  that  the  “who”  of
everyday Dasein just is not the “I myself”.

If,  in  arriving  at  ontico-ontological  assertions,  one  is  to  exhibit  the
phenomena  in  terms  of  the  kind  of  Being  which  the  entities  themselves
possess, and if this way of exhibiting them is to retain its priority over even
the  most  usual  and  obvious  of  answers  and  over  whatever  ways  of
formulating problems may have been derived from those answers, then the
phenomenological  Interpretation  of  Dasein  must  be  defended  against  a
perversion of our problematic when we come to the question we are about
to formulate.

But  is  it  not  contrary  to  the  rules  of  all  sound  method  to  approach  a
problematic without sticking to what is given as evident in the area of our
theme?  And  what  is  more  indubitable  than  the  givenness  of  the  “I”?  And
does not this givenness tell us that if we aim to work this out primordially,
we must disregard everything else that is ‘given’—not only a ‘world’ that is
[einer  seienden  “Welt”],  but  even  the  Being  of  other  ‘I’s?  The  kind  of
“giving” we have here is the mere, formal, reflective awareness of the “I”;
and  perhaps  what  it  gives  is  indeed  evident.(1)  This  insight  even  affords
access  to  a  phenomenological  problematic  in  its  own  right,  which  has  in
principle  the  signification  of  providing  a  framework  as  a  ‘formal
phenomenology of consciousness’.

Ichvernehmen gibt, evident.’

H. 116

 

In this context of an existential analytic of factical Dasein, the question
arises  whether  giving  the  “I”  in  the  way  we  have  mentioned  discloses
Dasein in its everydayness, if it discloses Dasein at all. Is it then obvious a
priori  that  access  to  Dasein  must  be  gained  only  by  mere  reflective
awareness of the “I” of actions? What if this kind of ‘giving-itself’ on the
part of Dasein should lead our existential analytic astray and do so, indeed,
in a manner grounded in the Being of Dasein itself? Perhaps when Dasein
addresses  itself  in  the  way  which  is  closest  to  itself;  it  always  says  “I  am
this entity”, and in the long run says this loudest when it is ‘not’ this entity.
Dasein  is  in  each  case  mine,  and  this  is  its  constitution;  but  what  if  this
should be the very reason why, proximally and for the most part, Dasein is
not itself? What if the aforementioned approach, starting with the givenness
of  the  “I”  to  Dasein  itself;  and  with  a  rather  patent  self-interpretation  of
Dasein, should lead the existential analytic, as it were, into a pitfall? If that
which  is  accessible  by  mere  “giving”  can  be  determined,  there  is
presumably  an  ontological  horizon  for  determining  it;  but  what  if  this
horizon should remain in principle undetermined? It may well be that it is
always  ontically  correct  to  say  of  this  entity  that  ‘I’  am  it.  Yet  the
ontological analytic which makes use of such assertions must make certain
reservations about them in principle. The word ‘I’ is to be understood only
in  the  sense  of  a  non-committal  formal  indicator,  indicating  something
which  may  perhaps  reveal  itself  as  its  ‘opposite’  in  some  particular
phenomenal  context  of  Being.  In  that  case,  the  ‘not-I’  is  by  no  means
tantamount to an entity which essentially lacks ‘I-hood’ [“Ichheit”], but is
rather a definite kind of Being which the ‘I’ itself possesses, such as having
lost itself [Selbstverlorenheit].

Yet  even  the  positive  Interpretation  of  Dasein  which  we  have  so  far
given, already forbids us to start with the formal givenness of the “I”, if our
purpose  is  to  answer  the  question  of  the  “who”  in  a  way  which  is
phenomenally  adequate.  In  clarifying  Being-in-the-world  we  have  shown
that  a  bare  subject  without  a  world  never  ‘is’  proximally,  nor  is  it  ever
given. And so in the end an isolated “I” without Others is just as far from
being proximally given.(i) If, however, ‘the Others’ already are there with
us  [mit  da  sind]  in  Being-in-the-world,  and  if  this  is  ascertained
phenomenally,  even  this  should  not  mislead  us  into  supposing  that  the
ontological  structure  of  what  is  thus  ‘given’  is  obvious,  requiring  no

investigation.  Our  task  is  to  make  visible  phenomenally  the  species  to
which this Dasein-with in closest everydayness belongs, and to Interpret it
in a way which is ontologically appropriate.

Just  as  the  ontical  obviousness  of  the  Being-in-itself  of  entities  within-
the-world misleads us into the conviction that the meaning of this Being is
obvious  ontologically,  and  makes  us  overlook  the  phenomenon  of  the
world, the ontical obviousness of the fact that Dasein is in each case mine,
also hides the possibility that the ontological problematic which belongs to
it has been led astray. Proximally the “who” of Dasein is not only a problem
ontologically; even ontically it remains concealed.

H. 117

 

But  does  this  mean  that  there  are  no  clues  whatever  for  answering  the
question of the “who” by way of existential analysis? Certainly not. Of the
ways in which we formally, indicated the constitution of Dasein’s Being in
Sections  9  and  12  above,  the  one  we  have  been  discussing  does  not,  of
course, function so well as such a clue as does the one according to which
Dasein’s ‘Essence’ is grounded in its existence.(1) If the ‘I’ is an Essential
characteristic  of  Dasein,  then  it  is  one  which  must  be  Interpreted
existentially. In that case the “Who?” is to be answered only by exhibiting
phenomenally a definite kind of Being which Dasein possesses.
 

i.  Cf.  what  Max  Scheler  has  pointed  out  phenomenologically  in  his  Zur  Phänomenologie  und
Theorie der Sympathiegefühle, 1913, Anhang, pp. 118 ff.; see also his second edition under the title
Wesen und Formen der Sympathie, 1923, pp. 244 ff.
 

1. ‘as such a clue’: here we read ‘als solcher’, following the later editions. The earliest editions

have ‘als solche’, which has been corrected in the list of errata.

“Essence”:  while  we  ordinarily  use  ‘essence’  and  ‘essential’  to  translate  ‘Wesen’  and
‘wesenhaft’, we shall use ‘Essence’ and “Essential’ (with initial capitals) to translate the presumably
synonymous but far less frequent ‘Essenz’ and ‘essentiell’.

The two ‘formal indications’ to which Heidegger refers are to be found on H. 42 above.

If in each case Dasein is its Self only in existing, then the constancy of
the  Self  no  less  than  the  possibility  of  its  ‘failure  to  stand  by  itself’(1)
requires  that  we  formulate  the  question  existentially  and  ontologically  as
the sole appropriate way of access to its problematic.

tantamount 

to  volatilizing 

But if the Self is conceived ‘only’ as a way of Being of this entity, this
seems 
the  real  ‘core’  of  Dasein.  Any
apprehensiveness  however  which  one  may  have  about  this  gets  its
nourishment from the perverse assumption that the entity in question has at
bottom the kind of Being which belongs to something present-at-hand, even
if  one  is  far  from  attributing  to  it  the  solidity  of  an  occurrent  corporeal
Thing. Yet man’s ‘substance’ is not spirit as a synthesis of soul and body; it
is rather existence.

26. The Dasein-with of Others and Everyday Being-with

 

The  answer  to  the  question  of  the  “who”  of  everyday  Dasein  is  to  be
obtained  by  analysing  that kind  of Being  in  which Dasein maintains itself
proximally  and  for  the  most  part.  Our  investigation  takes  its  orientation
from Being-in-the-world—that basic state of Dasein by which every mode
of  its  Being  gets  co-determined.  If  we  are  correct  in  saying  that  by  the
foregoing explication of the world, the remaining structural items of Being-
in-the-world have become visible, then this must also have prepared us, in a
way, for answering the question of the “who”.

In  our  ‘description’  of  that  environment  which  is  closest  to  us—the
work-world  of  the  craftsman,  for  example,—the  outcome  was  that  along
with  the  equipment  to  be  found  when  one  is  at  work  [in  Arbeit],  those
Others for whom the ‘work’ [“Werk”] is destined are ‘encountered too’.(2)
If this is ready-to-hand, then there lies in the kind of Being which belongs
to  it  (that  is,  in  its  involvement)  an  essential  assignment  or  reference  to
possible  wearers,  for  instance,  for  whom  it  should  be  ‘cut  to  the  figure’.
Similarly,  when  material  is  put  to  use,  we  encounter  its  producer  or
‘supplier’ as one who ‘serves’ well or badly.
 

1.  ‘…die  Ständigkeit  des  Selbst  ebensosehr  wie  seine  mögliche  “Unselbständigkeit”...’  The
adjective  ‘ständig’,  which  we  have  usually  translated  as  ‘constant’  in  the  sense  of  ‘permanent’  or
‘continuing’,  goes  back  to  the  root  meaning  of  ‘standing’,  as  do  the  adjectives  ‘selbständig’
(‘independent’)  and  ‘unselbständig’  (‘dependent’).  These  concepts  will  be  discussed  more  fully  in
Section  64  below,  especially  H.  322,  where  ‘Unselbständigkeit’  will  be  rewritten  not  as  ‘Un-
selbständkeit’  (‘failure  to  stand  by  one’s  Self’)  but  as  ‘Unselbst-ständigkeit’  (‘constancy  to  the
Unself’). See also H. 128. (The connection with the concept of existence will perhaps be clearer if
one recalls that the Latin verb ‘existere’ may also be derived from a verb of standing, as Heidegger
points out in his later writings.)

2. Cf. Section 15 above, especially H. 70f.

H. 118

 

When, for example, we walk along the edge of a field but ‘outside it’,
the field shows itself as belonging to such-and-such a person, and decently
kept up by him; the book we have used was bought at So-and-so’s shop and
given  by  such-and-such  a  person,  and  so  forth.  The  boat  anchored  at  the
shore  is  assigned  in  its  Being-in-itself  to  an  acquaintance  who  undertakes
voyages  with  it;  but  even  if  it  is  a  ‘boat  which  is  strange  to  us’,  it  still  is
indicative of Others. The Others who are thus ‘encountered’ in a ready-to-
hand,  environmental  context  of  equipment,  are  not  somehow  added  on  in
thought  to  some  Thing  which  is  proximally  just  present-at-hand;  such
‘Things’ are encountered from out of the world in which they are ready-to-
hand  for  Others—a  world  which  is  always  mine  too  in  advance.  In  our
previous  analysis,  the  range  of  what  is  encountered  within-the-world  was,
in the first instance, narrowed down to equipment ready-to-hand or Nature
present-at-hand,  and  thus  to  entities  with  a  character  other  than  that  of
Dasein.  This  restriction  was  necessary  not  only  for  the  purpose  of
simplifying our explication but above all because the kind of Being which
belongs to the Dasein of Others, as we encounter it within-the-world, differs
from  readiness-to-hand  and  presence-at-hand.  Thus  Dasein’s  world  frees
entities  which  not  only  are  quite  distinct  from  equipment  and  Things,  but
which also—in accordance with their kind of Being as Dasein themselves
—are ‘in’ the world in which they are at the same time encountered within-
the-world,  and  are  ‘in’  it  by  way  of  Being-in-the-world.(1)  These  entities
are neither present-at-hand nor ready-to-hand; on the contrary, they are like
the very Dasein which frees them, in that they are there too, and there with
it.  So  if  one  should  want  to  identify  the  world  in  general  with  entities
within-the-world, one would have to say that Dasein too is ‘world’.(2)
 

1. ‘…sondern gemäss seiner Seinsart als Dasein selbst  in  der  Weise  des  In-der-Welt-seins  “in”

der Welt ist, in der es zugleich innerweltlich begegnet.’

2.  ‘Dieses  Seiende  ist  weder  vorhanden  noch  zuhanden,  sondern  ist  so,  wie  das  freigebende
Dasein selbst—es ist auch und mit da. Wollte man denn schon Welt überhaupt mit dem innerweltlich
Seienden identifizieren, dann müsste man sagen, “Welt” ist auch Dasein.’

Thus  in  characterizing  the  encountering  of  Others,  one  is  again  still
oriented  by that Dasein which is  in  each case  one’s own.  But  even  in  this
characterization  does  one  not  start  by  marking  out  and  isolating  the  ‘I’  so

that one must then  seek some way  of getting  over to  the  Others  from this
isolated  subject?  To  avoid  this  misunderstanding  we  must  notice  in  what
sense  we  are  talking  about  ‘the  Others’.  By  ‘Others’  we  do  not  mean
everyone  else  but  me—those  over  against  whom  the  “I”  stands  out.  They
are  rather  those  from  whom,  for  the  most  part,  one  does  not  distinguish
oneself—those  among  whom  one  is  too.  This  Being-there-too  [Auch-da-
sein] with them does not have the ontological character of a Being-present-
at-hand-along-‘with’ them within a world. This  ‘with’  is  something of the
the  ‘too’  means  a  sameness  of  Being  as
character  of  Dasein; 
circumspectively concernful Being-in-the-world. ‘With’ and ‘too’ are to be
understood  existentially,  not  categorially.  By  reason  of  this  with-like
[mithaften]  Being-in-the-world,  the  world  is  always  the  one  that  I  share
with  Others.  The  world  of  Dasein  is  a  with-world  [Mitwelt].  Being-in  is
Being-with Others.  Their  Being-in-themselves  within-the-world  is  Dasein-
with [Mit-dasein].

H. 119

 

When Others are encountered, it is not the case that one’s own subject is
proximally  present-at-hand  and  that  the  rest  of  the  subjects,  which  are
likewise  occurrents,  get  discriminated  beforehand  and  then  apprehended;
nor  are  they  encountered  by  a  primary  act  of  looking  at  oneself  in  such  a
way  that  the  opposite  pole  of  a  distinction  first  gets  ascertained.  They  are
encountered  from  out  of  the  world,  in  which  concernfully  circumspective
Dasein  essentially  dwells.  Theoretically  concocted  ‘explanations’  of  the
Being-present-at-hand of Others urge themselves upon us all too easily; but
over against such explanations we must hold fast to the phenomenal facts of
the  case  which  we  have  pointed  out,  namely,  that  Others  are  encountered
environmentally.  This  elemental  worldly  kind  of  encountering,  which
belongs  to  Dasein  and  is  closest  to  it,  goes  so  far  that  even  one’s  own
Dasein becomes something that it can itself proximally ‘come across’ only
when  it  looks away  from  ‘Experiences’  and  the  ‘centre  of  its  actions’,  or
does not as yet ‘see’ them at all. Dasein finds ‘itself’ proximally in what it
does, uses, expects, avoids—in those things environmentally ready-to-hand
with which it is proximally concerned.

And  even  when  Dasein  explicitly  addresses  itself  as  “I  here”,  this
locative  personal  designation  must  be  understood  in  terms  of  Dasein’s

existential spatiality. In Interpreting this (See Section 23) we  have already
intimated that this “I-here” does not mean a certain privileged point—that
of an I-Thing—but is to be understood as Being-in in terms of the “yonder”
of  the  world  that  is  ready-to-hand—the  “yonder”  which  is  the  dwelling-
place of Dasein as concern.(1)
 

1. ‘…dass dieses Ich-hier nicht einen ausgezeichneten Punkt des Ichdinges meint, sondern sich
versteht als In-sein aus dem Dort der zuhandenen Welt, bei dem Dasein als Besorgen sich aufhält.’
The older editions have ‘In-Sein’ for ‘In-sein’, and ‘dabei’ for ‘bei dem’.

W. von Humboldt(ii) has alluded to certain languages which express the
‘I’ by ‘here’, the ‘thou’ by ‘there’, the ‘he’ by ‘yonder’, thus rendering the
personal  pronouns  by  locative  adverbs,  to  put  it  grammatically.  It  is
controversial  whether  indeed  the  primordial  signification  of  locative
expressions is adverbial or pronominal. But this dispute loses its basis if one
notes  that  locative  adverbs  have  a  relationship  to  the  “I”  qua  Dasein. The
‘here’  and  the  ‘there’  and  the  ‘yonder’  are  primarily  not  mere  ways  of
designating  the  location  of  entities  present-at-hand  within-the-world  at
positions  in  space;  they  are  rather  characteristics  of  Dasein’s  primordial
spatiality. These supposedly locative adverbs are Dasein-designations; 
they have a signification which is primarily existential, not categorial. But
they are not pronouns either; their signification is prior to the differentiation
of  locative  adverbs  and  personal  pronouns:  these  expressions  have  a
Dasein-signification  which  is  authentically  spatial,  and  which  serves  as
evidence that when we interpret Dasein without any theoretical distortions
we  can  see  it  immediately  as  ‘Being-alongside’  the  world  with  which  it
concerns  itself,  and  as  Being-alongside  it  spatially—that  is  to  say,  as
desevering*  and  giving  directionality.  In  the  ‘here’,  the  Dasein  which  is
absorbed in its world speaks not towards itself but away from itself towards
the  ‘yonder’  of  something  circumspectively  ready-to-hand;  yet  it  still  has
itself in view in its existential spatiality.

Dasein understands itself proximally and for the most part in terms of its
world; and the Dasein-with of Others is often encountered in terms of what
is  ready-to-hand  within-the-world.  But  even  if  Others  become  themes  for
study, as it were, in their own Dasein, they are not encountered as person-
Things present-at-hand: we meet them ‘at work’, that is, primarily in their
Being-in-the-world. Even if we see the Other ‘just standing around’, he is
never  apprehended  as  a  human-Thing  present-at-hand,  but  his  ‘standing-
around’ 
unconcerned,
uncircumspective tarrying alongside everything and nothing [Verweilen bei

The  expression  ‘Dasein’,  however,  shows  plainly  that  ‘in  the  first
instance’ this entity is unrelated to Others, and that of course it can still be
‘with’  Others  afterwards.  Yet  one  must  not  fail  to  notice  that  we  use  the
term “Dasein-with” to designate that Being for which the Others who  a r e
 [die seienden Anderen] are freed within-the-world. This Dasein-with of the
Others is disclosed within-the-world for a Dasein, and so too for those who
are  Daseins  with  us  [die  Mitdaseienden],  only  because  Dasein  in  itself  is
essentially  Being-with.  The  phenomenological  assertion  that  “Dasein  is
essentially Being-with” has an existential-ontological meaning. It does not
seek to establish ontically that factically I am not present-at-hand alone, and
that Others of my kind occur. If this were what is meant by the proposition
that  Dasein’s  Being-in-the-world  is  essentially  constituted  by  Being-with,
then  Being-with  would  not  be  an  existential  attribute  which  Dasein,  of  its
own accord, has coming to it from its own kind of Being. It would rather be
something  which  turns  up  in  every  case  by  reason  of  the  occurrence  of
Others.  Being-with  is  an  existential  characteristic  of  Dasein  even  when
factically  no  Other  is  present-at-hand  or  perceived.  Even  Dasein’s  Being-
alone  is  Being-with  in  the  world.  The  Other  can  be  missing  only  in  and
for(1) a Being-with. Being-alone is a deficient mode of Being-with; its very
possibility is the proof of this. On the other hand, factical Being-alone is not
obviated by the occurrence of a second example of a human being ‘beside’
me,  or by ten  such examples. Even if  these and more  are  present-at-hand,
Dasein can still be alone. So Being-with and the facticity of Being with one

another are not based on the occurrence together of several ‘subjects’. Yet
Being-alone  ‘among’  many  does  not  mean  that  with  regard  to  their  Being
they  are  merely  present-at-hand  there  alongside  us.  Even  in  our  Being
‘among them’ they are there with us; their Dasein-with is encountered in a
mode  in  which  they  are  indifferent  and  alien.  Being  missing  and  ‘Being
away’  [Das  Fehlen  und  “Fortsein”]  are  modes  of  Dasein-with,  and  are
possible  only  because  Dasein  as  Being-with  lets  the  Dasein  of  Others  be
encountered  in  its  world.  Being-with  is  in  every  case  a  characteristic  of
one’s  own  Dasein;  Dasein-with  characterizes  the  Dasein  of  Others  to  the
extent that it is freed by its world for a Being-with. Only so far as one’s own
Dasein  has  the  essential  structure  of  Being-with,  is  it  Dasein-with  as
encounterable for Others.(2)

If Dasein-with remains existentially constitutive for Being-in-the-world,
then,  like  our  circumspective  dealings  with  the  ready-to-hand  within-the-
world (which, by way of anticipation, we have called ‘concern’), it must be
Interpreted in terms of the phenomenon of care; for as “care” the Being of
Dasein in general is to be defined(3). (Compare Chapter 6 of this Division.)
Concern is a character-of-Being which Being-with cannot have as its own,
even  though  Being-with,  like  concern,  is  a  Being  towards  entities
encountered  within-the-world.  But  those  entities  towards  which  Dasein  as
Being-with comports itself do not have the kind of Being which belongs to
equipment  ready-to-hand;  they  are  themselves  Dasein.  These  entities  are
not objects of concern, but rather of solicitude.(4)

2. ‘…Mitdasein charakterisiert das Dasein anderer, sofern es für ein Mitsein durch dessen Welt
freigegeben ist. Das eigene Dasein ist, sofern es die Wesensstruktur des Mitseins hat, als für Andere
begegnend Mitdasein.’

3. ‘…als welche das Sein des Daseins überhaupt bestimmt wird.’ The older editions omit ‘wird’.
4. ‘Dieses Seiende wird nicht besorgt, sondern steht in der Fürsorge.’ There is no good English
equivalent for ‘Fürsorge’, which we shall usually translate by ‘solicitude’. The more literal ‘caring-
for’  has  the  connotation  of  ‘being  fond  of’,  which  we  do  not  want  here;  ‘personal  care’  suggests
personal hygiene; ‘personal concern’ suggests one’s personal business or affairs. ‘Fürsorge’ is rather
the kind of care which we find in ‘prenatal care’ or ‘taking care of the children’, or even the kind of
care  which  is  administered  by  welfare  agencies.  Indeed  the  word  ‘Fürsorge’  is  regularly  used  in
contexts  where  we  would  speak  of  ‘welfare  work’  or  ‘social  welfare’;  this  is  the  usage  which
Heidegger  has  in  mind  in  his  discussion  of  ‘Fürsorge’  as  ‘a  factical  social  arrangement’.  (The
etymological  connection  between  ‘Sorge  (‘care’),  ‘Fürsorge’  (‘solicitude’),  and  ‘Besorgen
(‘concern’), is entirely lost in our translation.)

Even ‘concern’ with food and clothing, and the nursing of the sick body,
are forms of solicitude. But we understand the expression “solicitude” in a
way  which  corresponds  to  our  use  of  “concern”  as  a  term  for  an
existentiale. For example, ‘welfare work’ [“Fürsorge”], as a factical social
arrangement,  is  grounded  in  Dasein’s  state  of  Being  as  Being-with.  Its
factical  urgency  gets  its  motivation  in  that  Dasein  maintains  itself
proximally and for the most part in the deficient modes of solicitude. Being
for, against, or without one another, passing one another by, not “mattering”
to  one  another—these  are  possible  ways  of  solicitude.  And  it  is  precisely
these last-named deficient and Indifferent modes that characterize everyday,
average  Being-with-one-another.  These  modes  of  Being  show  again  the
characteristics of inconspicuousness and obviousness which belong just as
much  to  the  everyday  Dasein-with  of  Others  within-the-world  as  to  the
readiness-to-hand  of  the  equipment  with  which  one  is  daily  concerned.
These  Indifferent  modes  of  Being-with-one-another  may  easily  mislead
ontological  Interpretation  into  interpreting  this  kind  of  Being,  in  the  first
instance, as the mere Being-present-at-hand of several subjects. It seems as
if  only  negligible  variations  of  the  same  kind  of  Being  lie  before  us;  yet
ontologically there is an essential distinction between the ‘indifferent’ way
in  which  Things  at  random  occur  together  and  the  way  in  which  entities
who are with one another do not “matter” to one another.

H. 122

 

With  regard  to  its  positive  modes,  solicitude  has  two  extreme
possibilities.  It  can,  as  it  were,  take  away  ‘care’  from  the  Other  and  put
itself  in  his  position  in  concern:  it  can  leap  in  for  him.(1)  This  kind  of
solicitude takes over for the Other that with which he is to concern himself.
The  Other  is  thus  thrown  out  of  his  own  position;  he  steps  back  so  that
afterwards, when the matter has been attended to, he can either take it over
as  something  finished  and  at  his  disposal,(2)  or  disburden  himself  of  it
completely. In such solicitude the Other can become one who is dominated
and  dependent,  even  if  this  domination  is  a  tacit  one  and  remains  hidden
from him. This kind of solicitude, which leaps in and takes away ‘care’, is
to a large extent determinative for Being with one another, and pertains for
the most part to our concern with the ready-to-hand.
 

1.  ‘…sich  an  seine  Stelle  setzen,  für  ihn  einspringen.’  Here,  as  on  H.  100  (See  our  note  2),  it
would be more idiomatic to translate ‘für ihn einspringen’ as ‘intervene for him’, ‘stand in for him’
or  ‘serve  as  deputy  for  him’;  but  since  ‘einspringen’  is  to  be  contrasted  with  ‘vorspringen’,
‘vorausspringen’  and  perhaps  even  ‘entspringen’  in  the  following  paragraphs,  we  have  chosen  a
translation which suggests the etymological connection.

2. ‘…um nachträglich das Besorgte als fertig Verfügbares zu übernehmen...’

In  contrast  to  this,  there  is  also  the  possibility  of  a  kind  of  solicitude
which  does  not  so  much  leap  in  for  the  Other  as  leap  ahead  of  him  [ihm
vorausspringt] in his existentiell potentiality-for-Being, not in order to take
away his ‘care’ but rather to give it back to him authentically as such for the
first time. This kind of solicitude pertains essentially to authentic care—that
is, to the existence of the Other, not to a “what” with which he is concerned;
it  helps  the  Other  to  become  transparent  to  himself  in  his  care  and  to
become free for it.

Solicitude  proves  to  be  a  state  of  Dasein’s  Being—one  which,  in
accordance  with  its  different  possibilities,  is  bound  up  with  its  Being
towards  the  world  of  its  concern,  and  likewise  with  its  authentic  Being
towards  itself.  Being  with  one  another  is  based  proximally  and  often
exclusively  upon  what  is  a  matter  of  common  concern  in  such  Being.  A
Being-with-one-another  which  arises  [entspringt]  from  one’s  doing  the
same  thing  as  someone  else,  not  only  keeps  for  the  most  part  within  the
outer limits, but enters the mode of distance and reserve. The Being-with-
one-another of those who are hired for the same affair often thrives only on
mistrust. On the other hand, when they devote themselves to the same affair
in  common,  their  doing  so  is  determined  by  the  manner  in  which  their
Dasein, each in its own way, has been taken hold of.(1) They thus become
authentically  bound  together,  and  this  makes  possible  the  right  kind  of
objectivity  [die  rechte  Sachlichkeit],  which  frees  the  Other  in  his  freedom
for himself.

Everyday  Being-with-one-another  maintains  itself  between  the  two
extremes of positive solicitude—that which leaps in and dominates, and that
which  leaps  forth  and  liberates  [vorspringend-befreienden].  It  brings
numerous mixed forms to maturity;(2) to describe these and classify them
would take us beyond the limits of this investigation.

Just as circumspection belongs to concern as a way of discovering what
is ready-to-hand, solicitude is guided by considerateness  and forbearance.

3. ‘Wie dem Besorgen als Weise des Entdeckens des Zuhandenen die Umsicht zugehört, so ist die
Fürsorge  geleitet  durch  die  Rücksicht  und  Nachsicht.’  Heidegger  is  here  calling  attention  to  the
etymological kinship of the three words which he italicizes, each of which stands for a special kind of
sight or seeing (‘Sicht’).

The italicization of ‘Umsicht’ (‘circumspection’) is introduced in the newer editions.
4.  ‘…bis  zur  Rücksichtslosigkeit  und  dem  Nachsehen,  das  die  Gleichgültigkeit  leitet.’  This
passage  is  ambiguous  both  syntactically  and  semantically.  It  is  not  clear,  for  instance,  whether  the
subject  of  the  relative  clause  is  ‘die  Gleichgültigkeit’  or  the  pronoun  ‘das’,  though  we  prefer  the
former interpretation. ‘Nachsehen’, which is etymologically akin to ‘Nachsicht’, means to ‘inspect’
or ‘check’ something; but it often means to do this in a very perfunctory manner, and this latter sense
may well be the one which Heidegger has in mind.

The  world  not  only  frees  the  ready-to-hand  as  entities  encountered
within-the-world; it also frees Dasein—the Others in their Dasein-with. But
Dasein’s ownmost meaning of Being is such that this entity (which has been
freed  environmentally)  is  Being-in  in  the  same  world  in  which,  as
encounterable  for  Others,  it  is  there  with  them.  We  have  interpreted
worldhood as that referential totality which constitutes significance (Section
18). In Being-familiar with  this significance  and previously  understanding
it,  Dasein  lets  what  is  ready-to-hand  be  encountered  as  discovered  in  its
involvement.  In  Dasein’s  Being,  the  context  of  references  or  assignments
which  significance  implies  is  tied  up  with  Dasein’s  ownmost  Being—a
Being which essentially can have no involvement, but which is rather that
Being for the sake of which Dasein itself is as it is.

According  to  the  analysis  which  we  have  now  completed,  Being  with
Others belongs to the Being of Dasein, which is an issue for Dasein in its
very  Being.(1)  Thus  as  Being-with,  Dasein  ‘is’  essentially  for  the  sake  of
Others.  This  must  be  understood  as  an  existential  statement  as  to  its
essence. Even if the particular factical Dasein does not turn to Others, and
supposes that it has no need of them or manages to get along without them,

it  is  in  the  way  of  Being-with.  In  Being-with,  as  the  existential  “for-the-
sake-of” of Others, these have already been disclosed in their Dasein. With
their  Being-with,  their  disclosedness  has  been  constituted  beforehand;
accordingly, this disclosedness also goes to make up significance—that is to
say,  worldhood.  And,  significance,  as  worldhood,  is  tied  up  with  the
existential “for-the-sake-of-which”.(2) Since the worldhood of that world in
which every Dasein essentially is already, is thus constituted, it accordingly
lets us encounter what is environmentally ready-to-hand as something with
which we are circumspectively concerned, and it does so in such a way that
together  with  it  we  encounter  the  Dasein-with  of  Others.  The  structure  of
the  world’s  worldhood  is  such  that  Others  are  not  proximally  present-at-
hand as free-floating subjects along with other Things, but show themselves
in  the  world  in  their  special  environmental  Being,  and  do  so  in  terms  of
what is ready-to-hand in that world.

H. 124

 

Being-with  is  such  that  the  disclosedness  of  the  Dasein-with  of  Others
belongs  to  it;  this  means  that  because  Dasein’s  Being  is  Being-with,  its
understanding  of  Being  already  implies  the  understanding  of  Others.  This
understanding, like any understanding, is not an acquaintance derived from
knowledge about them, but a primordially existential kind of Being, which,
more than anything else, makes such knowledge and acquaintance possible.
(1)  Knowing  oneself  [Sichkennen]  is  grounded  in  Being-with,  which
understands  primordially.  It  operates  proximally  in  accordance  with  the
kind  of  Being  which  is  closest  to  us—Being-in-the-world  as  Being-with;
and  it  does  so  by  an  acquaintance  with  that  which  Dasein,  along  with  the
Others,  comes  across  in  its  environmental  circumspection  and  concerns
itself  with—an  acquaintance  in  which  Dasein  understands.  Solicitous
concern  is  understood  in  terms  of  what  we  are  concerned  with,  and  along
with  our  understanding  of  it.  Thus  in  concernful  solicitude  the  Other  is
proximally disclosed.

But  because  solicitude  dwells  proximally  and  for  the  most  part  in  the
deficient or at least the Indifferent modes (in the indifference of passing one
another  by),  the  kind  of  knowing-oneself  which  is  essential  and  closest,
demands  that  one  become  acquainted  with  oneself.(2)  And  when,  indeed,
one’s  knowing-oneself  gets  lost  in  such  ways  as  aloofness,  hiding  oneself
away, or putting on a disguise, Being-with-one-another must follow special
routes of its own in order to come close to Others, or even to ‘see through
them’ [“hinter sie” zu kommen].
 

1. ‘Dieses Verstehen ist, wie Verstehen überhaupt, nicht eine aus Erkennen erwachsene Kenntnis,
sondern eine ursprünglich existenziale Seinsart die Erkennen und Kenntnis allererst möglich macht’.
While  we  have  here  translated  ‘Kenntnis’  as  ‘acquaintance’  and  ‘Erkennen’  as  ‘knowledge  about’,
these terms must not be understood in the special senses exploited by Lord Russell and C. L. Lewis.
The  ‘acquaintance’  here  involved  is  of  the  kind  which  may  be  acquired  whenever  one  is  well
informed about something, whether one has any direct contact with it or not.

2.  ‘…bedarf  das  nächste  und  wesenhafte  Sichkennen  eines  Sichkennenlernens.’  ‘Sichkennen’
(‘knowing oneself’) is to be distinguished sharply from ‘Selbsterkenntnis’ (‘knowledge of the Self’),
which will be discussed on H. 146. See our note 1.

But just as opening oneself up [Sichoffenbaren] or closing oneself off is
grounded in one’s having Being-with-one-another as one’s kind of Being at
the time, and indeed is nothing else but this, even the explicit disclosure of
the Other in solicitude grows only out of one’s primarily Being with him in
each case. Such a disclosure of the Other (which is indeed thematic, but not
in  the  manner  of  theoretical  psychology)  easily  becomes  the  phenomenon
which  proximally  comes  to  view  when  one  considers  the  theoretical
problematic  of  understanding  the  ‘psychical  life  of  Others’  [“fremden
Seelenlebens”]. In this phenomenally ‘proximal’ manner it thus presents a
way of Being with one another understandingly; but at the same time it gets
taken as that which, primordially and ‘in the beginning’, constitutes Being
towards  Others  and  makes  it  possible  at  all.  This  phenomenon,  which  is
none too happily designated as ‘empathy’ [“Einfühlung”], is then supposed,
as  it  were,  to  provide  the  first  ontological  bridge  from  one’s  own  subject,
which  is  given  proximally  as  alone,  to  the  other  subject,  which  is
proximally quite closed off.

Of  course  Being  towards  Others  is  ontologically  different  from  Being
towards Things which are present-at-hand. The entity which is ‘other’ has
itself the same kind of Being as Dasein. In Being with and towards Others,
there  is  thus  a  relationship  of  Being  [Seinsverhältnis]  from  Dasein  to

Dasein. But it might be said that this relationship is already constitutive for
one’s own Dasein, which, in its own right, has an understanding of Being,
and which thus  relates itself(1)  towards  Dasein. The  relationship-of-Being
which one has towards Others would then become a Projection(2) of one’s
own  Being-towards-oneself  ‘into  something  else’.  The  Other  would  be  a
duplicate of the Self.

H. 125

 

But while these deliberations seem obvious enough, it is easy to see that
they have little ground to stand on. The presupposition which this argument
demands—that Dasein’s Being towards itself is Being towards an Other—
fails to hold. As long as the legitimacy of this presupposition has not turned
out to be evident, one may still be puzzled as to how Dasein’s relationship
to itself is thus to be disclosed to the Other as Other.

is  Being 

Not  only 

towards  Others  an  autonomous, 

irreducible
relationship  of  Being:  this  relationship,  as  Being-with,  is  one  which,  with
Dasein’s  Being,  already  is.(3)  Of  course  it  is  indisputable  that  a  lively
mutual  acquaintanceship  on  the  basis  of  Being-with,  often  depends  upon
how far one’s own Dasein has understood itself at the time; but this means
that  it  depends  only  upon  how  far  one’s  essential  Being  with  Others  has
made itself transparent and has not disguised itself.(4) And that is possible
only  if  Dasein,  as  Being-in-the-world,  already  is  with  Others.  ‘Empathy’
does  not  first  constitute  Being-with;  only  on  the  basis  of  Being-with  does
‘empathy’ become possible: it gets its motivation from the unsociability of
the dominant modes of Being-with.(5)
 

1.  ‘…sich...  verhält...’  We  have  often  translated  this  expression  as  ‘comports  itself’,
compromising  between  two  other  possible  meanings:  ‘relates  itself’  and  ‘behaves’  or  ‘conducts
itself’. In this passage, however, and in many others where this expression is tied up with ‘Verhältnis’
(‘relationship’)  rather  than  with  ‘Verhalten’  (‘behaviour’  or  ‘conduct’),  only  ‘relates  itself’  seems
appropriate.

2. ‘Projektion’. Here we are dealing with ‘projection’ in the familiar psychological sense, not in

the sense which would be expressed by ‘Entwurf’. See H. 145 ff.

3.  ‘Das  Sein  zu  Anderen  ist  nicht  nur  ein  eigenständiger,  irreduktibler  Seinsbezug,  er  ist  als

Mitsein mit dem Sein des Daseins schon seiend.’

4.  ‘…wie  weit  es  das  wesenhafte  Mitsein  mit  anderen  sich  durchsichtig  gemacht  und  nicht

verstellt hat...’ (The older editions have ‘...sich nicht undurchsichtig gemacht und verstellt hat…’)

5. ‘ “Einfühlung” konstituiert nicht erst das Mitsein, sondern ist auf dessen Grunde erst möglich
und durch die vorherrschenden defizienten Modi des Mitseins in ihrer Unumgänglichkeit motiviert.’

But the fact that ‘empathy’ is not a primordial existential phenomenon,
any  more  than  is  knowing  in  general,  does  not  mean  that  there  is  nothing
problematical  about  it.  The  special  hermeneutic  of  empathy  will  have  to
show  how  Being-with-one-another  and  Dasein’s  knowing  of  itself  are  led
astray  and  obstructed  by  the  various  possibilities  of  Being  which  Dasein
itself  possesses,  so  that  a  genuine  ‘understanding’  gets  suppressed,  and
Dasein  takes  refuge  in  substitutes;  the  possibility  of  understanding  the
stranger correctly presupposes such a hermeneutic as its positive existential
condition.(1)  Our  analysis  has  shown  that  Being-with  is  an  existential
constituent  of  Being-in-the-world.  Dasein-with  has  proved  to  be  a  kind  of
Being  which  entities  encountered  within-the-world  have  as  their  own.  So
far  as Dasein is at  all,  it  has  Being-with-one-another  as  its  kind  of  Being.
This cannot be conceived as a summative result of the occurrence of several
‘subjects’.  Even  to  come  across  a  number  of  ‘subjects’  [einer  Anzahl  von
“Subjekten”]  becomes  possible  only  if  the  Others  who  are  concerned
proximally 
treated  merely  as  ‘numerals’
[“Nummer”].  Such  a  number  of  ‘subjects’  gets  discovered  only  by  a
definite  Being-with-and-towards-one-another.  This  ‘inconsiderate’  Being-
with  ‘reckons’  [“rechnet”]  with  the  Others  without  seriously  ‘counting  on
them’  [“auf  sie  zählt”],  or  without  even  wanting  to  ‘have  anything  to  do’
with them.

their  Dasein-with  are 

in 

One’s  own  Dasein,  like  the  Dasein-with  of  Others,  is  encountered
proximally and for the most part in terms of the with-world with which we
are environmentally concerned. When Dasein is absorbed in the world of its
concern—that is, at the same time, in its Being-with towards Others—it is
not  itself.  Who  is  it,  then,  who  has  taken  over  Being  as  everyday  Being-
with-one-another?
 

1.  ‘…welche  positive  existenziale  Bedingung  rechtes  Fremdverstehen  für  seine  Möglichkeit
voraussetzt.’  We  have  construed  ‘welche’  as  referring  back  to  ‘Hermeneutik’,  though  this  is  not
entirely clear.

27. Everyday Being-one’s-Self and the “They”

 

 

H. 126

The  ontologically  relevant  result  of  our  analysis  of  Being-with  is  the
insight that the ‘subject character’ of one’s own Dasein and that of Others is
to  be defined existentially—that  is,  in  terms  of certain  ways  in  which one
may  be.  In  that  with  which  we  concern  ourselves  environmentally  the
Others  are  encountered  as  what  they  are;  they  are what  they  do  [sie  sind
das, was sie betreiben].

In one’s concern with what one has taken hold of, whether with, for, or
against,  the  Others,  there  is  constant  care  as  to  the  way  one  differs  from
them,  whether  that  difference  is  merely  one  that  is  to  be  evened  out,
whether one’s own Dasein has lagged behind the Others and wants to catch
up  in  relationship  to  them,  or  whether  one’s  Dasein  already  has  some
priority over them and sets out to keep them suppressed. The care about this
distance between them is disturbing to Being-with-one-another, though this
disturbance  is  one  that  is  hidden  from  it.  If  we  may  express  this
existentially, such Being-with-one-another has the character of distantiality
[Abständigkeit]. The more inconspicuous this kind of Being is to everyday
Dasein  itself,  all  the  more  stubbornly  and  primordially  does  it  work  itself
out.

But this distantiality which belongs to Being-with, is such that Dasein, as
everyday  Being-with-one-another,  stands  in  subjection  [Botmässigkeit]  to
Others.  It  itself  is  not;(1)  its  Being  has  been  taken  away  by  the  Others.
Dasein’s everyday possibilities of Being are for the Others to dispose of as
they  please.  These  Others,  moreover,  are  not  definite  Others.  On  the
contrary,    a  n  y    Other  can  represent  them.  What  is  decisive  is  just  that
inconspicuous  domination  by  Others  which  has  already  been  taken  over
unawares  from  Dasein  as  Being-with.  One  belongs  to  the  Others  oneself
and enhances their power. ‘The Others’ whom one thus designates in order
to cover up the fact of one’s belonging to them essentially oneself, are those
who proximally and for the most part ‘are there’ in  everyday  Being-with-
one-another.  The  “who”  is  not  this  one,  not  that  one,  not  oneself  [man
selbst], not some people [einige], and not the sum of them all. The ‘who’ is
the neuter, the “they” [das Man].
 

1. ‘Nicht es selbst ist;…’

H. 127

 

We have shown earlier how in the environment which lies closest to us,
the  public  ‘environment’  already  is  ready-to-hand  and  is  also  a  matter  of
concern [mitbesorgt]. In utilizing public means of transport and in making
use of information services such as the newspaper, every Other is like the
next.  This  Being-with-one-another dissolves  one’s own Dasein completely
into  the  kind  of  Being  of  ‘the  Others’,  in  such  a  way,  indeed,  that  the
Others,  as  distinguishable  and  explicit,  vanish  more  and  more.  In  this
inconspicuousness and unascertainability, the real dictatorship of the “they”
is  unfolded.  We  take  pleasure  and  enjoy  ourselves  as  they  [man]  take
pleasure;  we  read,  see,  and  judge  about  literature  and  art  as  they  see  and
judge; likewise we shrink back from the ‘great mass’ as they shrink  back;
we find ‘shocking’ what they find  shocking.  The “they”, which is  nothing
definite,  and  which  all  are,  though  not  as  the  sum,  prescribes  the  kind  of
Being of everydayness.

The  “they”  has  its  own  ways  in  which  to  be.  That  tendency  of  Being-
with which we have called “distantiality” is grounded in the fact that Being-
with-one-another  concerns  itself  as  such  with  averageness,  which  is  an
existential characteristic of the “they”. The “they”, in its Being, essentially
makes  an  issue  of  this.  Thus  the  “they”  maintains  itself  factically  in  the
averageness of that which belongs to it, of that which it regards as valid and
that  which  it  does  not,  and  of  that  to  which  it  grants  success  and  that  to
which it denies it. In this averageness with which it prescribes what can and
may  be  ventured,  it  keeps  watch  over  everything  exceptional  that  thrusts
itself  to  the  fore.  Every  kind  of  priority  gets  noiselessly  suppressed.
Overnight, everything that is primordial gets glossed over as something that
has  long  been  well  known.  Everything  gained  by  a  struggle  becomes  just
something  to  be  manipulated.  Every  secret  loses  its  force.  This  care  of
averageness reveals in turn an essential tendency of Dasein which we call
the “levelling down” [Einebnung] of all possibilities of Being.

Distantiality, averageness, and levelling down, as ways of Being for the
“they”,  constitute  what  we  know  as  ‘publicness’  [“die  Offentlichkeit”].
Publicness  proximally  controls  every  way  in  which  the  world  and  Dasein
get interpreted, and it is always right—not because there is some distinctive
and  primary  relationship-of-Being  in  which  it  is  related  to  ‘Things’,  or
because it avails itself of some transparency on the part of Dasein which it
has explicitly appropriated, but because it is insensitive to every difference
of level and of genuineness and thus never gets to the ‘heart of the matter’

[“auf die Sachen”]. By publicness everything gets obscured, and what has
thus been covered up gets passed off as something familiar and accessible
to everyone.

The “they” is there alongside everywhere [ist überall dabei], but in such
a  manner  that  it  has  always  stolen  away  whenever  Dasein  presses  for  a
decision. Yet because the “they” presents every judgment and decision as its
own, it deprives the particular Dasein of its answerability. The “they” can,
as  it  were,  manage  to  have  ‘them’  constantly  invoking  it.(1)  It  can  be
answerable for everything most easily, because it is not someone who needs
to vouch for anything. It ‘was’ always the “they” who did it, and yet it can
be  said  that  it  has  been  ‘no  one’.  In  Dasein’s  everydayness  the  agency
through which most things come about is one of which we must say that “it
was no one”.
 

1. ‘Das Man kann es sich gleichsam leisten, dass “man” sich ständig auf es beruft.’

H. 128

 

Thus  the  particular  Dasein  in  its  everydayness  is  disburdened  by  the
“they”.  Not  only  that;  by  thus  disburdening  it  of  its  Being,  the  “they”
accommodates  Dasein  [kommt...  dem  Dasein  entgegen]  if  Dasein  has  any
tendency to take things easily and make them easy. And because the “they”
constantly  accommodates  the  particular  Dasein  by  disburdening  it  of  its
Being, the “they” retains and enhances its stubborn dominion.

Everyone is the other, and no one is himself. The “they”, which supplies
the  answer  to  the  question  of  the  “who”  of  everyday  Dasein,  is  the
“nobody” to  whom  every  Dasein  has  already  surrendered  itself  in  Being-
among-one-other [Untereinandersein].

In these characters of Being which we have exhibited—everyday Being-
among-one-another,  distantiality,  averageness,  levelling  down,  publicness,
the disburdening of one’s Being, and accommodation—lies that ‘constancy’
of  Dasein  which  is  closest  to  us.  This  “constancy”  pertains  not  to  the
enduring Being-present-at-hand of something, but rather to Dasein’s kind of
Being as Being-with. Neither the Self of one’s own Dasein nor the Self of
the Other has as yet found itself or lost itself as long as it is [seiend] in the
modes  we  have  mentioned.  In  these  modes  one’s  way  of  Being  is  that  of
inauthenticity  and  failure  to  stand  by  one’s  Self.(1)  To  be  in  this  way

signifies  no  lessening  of  Dasein’s  facticity,  just  as  the  “they”,  as  the
“nobody”,  is  by  no  means  nothing  at  all.  On  the  contrary,  in  this  kind  of
Being, Dasein is an ens realissimum, if by ‘Reality’ we understand a Being
that has the character of Dasein.
 

1.  ‘Man  ist  in  der  Weise  der  Unselbständigkeit  und  Uneigentlichkeit.’  On  ‘Ständigkeit’  and

‘Unselbständigkeit’ see our note 1, H. 117 above.

Of  course,  the  “they”  is  as  little  present-at-hand  as  Dasein  itself.  The
more openly the “they” behaves, the harder it is to grasp, and the slier it is,
but  the  less  is  it  nothing  at  all.  If  we  ‘see’  it  ontico-ontologically  with  an
unprejudiced eye, it reveals itself as the ‘Realest subject’ of everydayness.
And  even  if  it  is  not  accessible  like  a  stone  that  is  present-at-hand,  this  is
not  in  the  least  decisive  as  to  its  kind  of  Being.  One  may  neither  decree
prematurely that this “they” is ‘really’ nothing, nor profess the opinion that
one can Interpret this phenomenon ontologically by somehow ‘explaining’
it as what results from taking the Being-present-at-hand-together of several
subjects  and  then  fitting  them  together.  On  the  contrary,  in  working  out
concepts of Being one must direct one’s course by these phenomena, which
cannot be pushed aside.

H. 129

 

Furthermore, the “they” is not something like a ‘universal subject’ which
a plurality of subjects have hovering above them. One can come to take it
this  way  only  if  the  Being  of  such  ‘subjects’  is  understood  as  having  a
character other than that of Dasein, and if these are regarded as cases of a
genus  of  occurrents—cases  which  are  factually  present-at-hand.  With  this
approach, the only possibility ontologically is that everything which is not a
case of this sort is to be understood in the sense of genus and species. The
“they” is not the genus to which the individual Dasein belongs, nor can we
come  across  it  in  such  entities  as  an  abiding  characteristic.  That  even  the
traditional  logic  fails  us  when  confronted  with  these  phenomena,  is  not
surprising if we bear in mind that it has its foundation in an ontology of the
present-at-hand—an ontology which, moreover, is still a rough one. So no
matter  in  how  many  ways  this  logic  may  be  improved  and  expanded,  it
cannot  in  principle  be  made  any  more  flexible.  Such  reforms  of  logic,

oriented  towards  the  ‘humane  sciences’,  only  increase  the  ontological
confusion.

The “they” is an  e x i s t e n t i a l e; and as a primordial phenomenon,
it  belongs  to  Dasein’s  positive  constitution.  It  itself  has,  in  turn,  various
possibilities  of  becoming  concrete  as  something  characteristic  of  Dasein
[seiner  daseinsmässigen  Konkretion].  The  extent  to  which  its  dominion
becomes compelling and explicit may change in the course of history.

The  Self  of  everyday  Dasein  is  the  they-self,(1)  which  we  distinguish
from the authentic Self—that is, from the Self which has been taken hold of
in its own way [eigens ergriffenen]. As they-self, the particular Dasein has
been  dispersed  into  the  “they”,  and  must  first  find  itself.  This  dispersal
characterizes  the  ‘subject’  of  that  kind  of  Being  which  we  know  as
concernful absorption in the world we encounter as closest to us. If Dasein
is  familiar  with  itself  as  they-self,  this  means  at  the  same  time  that  the
“they” itself prescribes that way of interpreting the world and Being-in-the-
world which lies closest. Dasein is for the sake of the “they” in an everyday
manner,  and  the  “they”  itself  Articulates  the  referential  context  of
significance.(2)  When  entities  are  encountered,  Dasein’s  world  frees  them
for a totality of involvements with which the “they” is familiar, and within
the  limits  which  have  been  established  with  the  “they’s”  averageness.
Proximally, factical Dasein is in the with-world, which is discovered in an
average  way.  Proximally,  it  is  not  ‘I’,  in  the  sense  of  my  own  Self;  that
‘am’, but rather the Others, whose way is that of the “they”.(3) In terms of
the  “they”,  and  as  the  “they”,  I  am  ‘given’  proximally  to  ‘myself’  [mir
“selbst”]. Proximally Dasein is “they”, and for the most part it remains so.
If Dasein discovers the world in its own way [eigens] and brings it close, if
it  discloses  to  itself  its  own  authentic  Being,  then  this  discovery  of  the
‘world’  and  this  disclosure  of  Dasein  are  always  accomplished  as  a
clearing-away  of  concealments  and  obscurities,  as  a  breaking  up  of  the
disguises with which Dasein bars its own way.
 

1. ‘…das Man-selbst...’ This expression is also to be distinguished from ‘das Man selbst’ (‘the
“they”  itself’),  which  appears  elsewhere  in  this  paragraph.  In  the  first  of  these  expressions  ‘selbst’
appears as a substantive, in the second as a mere intensive.

2. 

‘Das  Man 

selbst,  worum-willen  das  Dasein 

artikuliert  den
Verweisungszusammenhang  der  Bedeutsamkeit.’  It  is  also  possible  to  construe  ‘alltäglich’  as  a
predicate  adjective  after  ‘ist’;  in  that  case  we  should  read:  ‘Dasein  is  everyday  for  the  sake  of  the
“they”.’

alltäglich 

ist, 

3. ‘Zunächst “bin”  nicht  “ich”  im  Sinne  des  eigenen  Selbst,  sondern  die  Anderen  in  der  Weise
des Man.’ In the earlier editions there are commas after ‘ “ich” ’ and ‘Anderen’, which would suggest
a somewhat different interpretation.

With  this  Interpretation  of  Being-with  and  Being-one’s-Self  in  the
“they”, the  question  of the  “who”  of the  everydayness of Being-with-one-
another is answered. These considerations have at the same time brought us
a concrete understanding of the basic constitution of Dasein: Being-in-the-
world, in its everydayness and its averageness, has become visible.

H. 130

 

From the kind of Being which belongs to the “they”—the kind which is
closest—everyday Dasein draws  its pre-ontological way  of interpreting its
Being.  In the  first  instance ontological  Interpretation  follows  the  tendency
to  interpret  it  this  way:  it  understands  Dasein  in  terms  of  the  world  and
comes across it as an entity within-the-world. But that is not all: even that
meaning  of  Being  on  the  basis  of  which  these  ‘subject’  entities  [diese
seienden “Subjekte”] get understood, is one which that ontology of Dasein
which  is  ‘closest’  to  us  lets  itself  present  in  terms  of  the  ‘world’.  But
because  the  phenomenon  of  the  world  itself  gets  passed  over  in  this
absorption in the world, its place gets taken [tritt an seine Stelle] by what is
present-at-hand  within-the-world,  namely,  Things.  The  Being  of  those
entities which are there with  us,  gets conceived as presence-at-hand. Thus
by  exhibiting  the  positive  phenomenon  of  the  closest  everyday  Being-in-
the-world, we have made it possible to get an insight into the reason why an
ontological Interpretation of this state of Being has been missing. This very
state of Being,(1) in  its everyday kind  of  Being,  is  what proximally  misses
itself and covers itself up.

If the Being of everyday Being-with-one-another is already different in
principle  from  pure  presence-at-hand—in  spite  of  the  fact  that  it  is
seemingly close to it ontologically—still less can the Being of the authentic
Self be conceived as presence-at-hand. Authentic Being-one’s-Self does not
rest upon an exceptional condition of the subject, a condition that has been
detached  from  the  “they”;  it  is  rather  an  existentiell  modification  of  the
“they”—of the “they” as an essential  e x i s t e n t i a l e.

But in that case there is ontologically a gap separating the selfsameness
of  the  authentically  existing  Self  from  the  identity  of  that  “I”  which

maintains itself throughout its manifold Experiences.
 

1. We interpret Heidegger’s pronoun ‘Sie’ as referring to ‘Seinsverfassung’ (‘state of Being’); but
there are other words in the previous sentence to which it might refer with just as much grammatical
plausibility, particularly ‘Interpretation’.

V: BEING-IN AS SUCH

28. The Task of a Thematic Analysis of Being-in

 

 

 

H. 131

IN  the  preparatory  stage  of  the  existential  analytic  of  Dasein,  we  have
for our leading theme this entity’s basic state, Being-in-the-World. Our first
aim is to bring into relief phenomenally the unitary primordial structure of
Dasein’s Being, in terms of which its possibilities and the ways for it ‘to be’
are ontologically determined. Up till now, our phenomenal characterization
of Being-in-the-world  has been directed towards  the  world, as a structural
item of Being-in-the-world, and has attempted to provide an answer to the
question about the “who” of this entity in its everydayness. But even in first
marking out the tasks of a preparatory fundamental analysis of Dasein, we
have already provided an advance orientation as to Being-in as such,(i) and
have illustrated it in the concrete mode of knowing the world.(ii)

The  fact  that  we  foresaw  this  structural  item  which  carries  so  much
weight, arose from our aim of setting the analysis of single items, from the
outset,  within  the  frame  of  a  steady  preliminary  view  of  the  structural
whole,  and  of  guarding  against  any  disruption  or  fragmentation  of  the
unitary phenomenon. Now, keeping in mind what has been achieved in the
concrete  analysis  of  the  world  and  the  “who”,  we  must  turn  our
Interpretation  back  to  the  phenomenon  of  Being-in.  By  considering  this
more  penetratingly,  however,  we  shall  not  only  get  a  new  and  surer
phenomenological view of the structural totality of Being-in-the-world, but
shall also pave the way to grasping the primordial Being of Dasein itself—
namely, care.

But  what  more  is  there  to  point  out  in  Being-in-the-world,  beyond  the
essential  relations  of  Being  alongside  the  world  (concern),  Being-with
(solicitude),  and  Being-one’s-Self  (“who”)?  If  need  be,  there  still  remains
the  analysis  by  characterizing
the  possibility  of  broadening  out 

comparatively  the  variations  of  concern  and  its  circumspection,  of
solicitude  and  the  considerateness  which  goes  with  it;  there  is  also  the
possibility of contrasting Dasein with entities whose character is not that of
Dasein  by  a  more  precise  explication  of  the  Being  of  all  possible  entities
within-the-world. Without question, there are unfinished tasks still lying in
this field. What we have hitherto set forth needs to be rounded out in many
ways  by  working  out  fully  the  existential  a  priori  of  philosophical
anthropology  and  taking  a  look  at  it.  But  this  is  not  the  aim  of  our
investigation. Its  aim  is  one  of  fundamental  ontology. Consequently,  if  we
inquire  about  Being-in  as  our  theme,  we  cannot  indeed  consent  to  nullify
the  primordial  character  of  this  phenomenon  by  deriving  it  from  others—
that is  to  say, by an inappropriate  analysis,  in  the  sense  of a dissolving or
breaking up. But the fact that something primordial is underivable does not
rule out the possibility that a multiplicity of characteristics of Being may be
constitutive  for  it.  If  these  show  themselves,  then  existentially  they  are
equiprimordial.  The  phenomenon  of  the  equiprimordiality  of  constitutive
items  has  often  been  disregarded 
in  ontology,  because  of  a
methodologically unrestrained tendency to  derive everything  and anything
from some simple ‘primal ground’.

H. 132

 

In which direction must we look, if we are to characterize Being-in, as
such, phenomenally? We get the answer to this question by recalling what
we were charged with keeping phenomenologically in view when we called
attention to this phenomenon: Being-in is distinct from the present-at-hand
insideness of something present-at-hand ‘in’ something else that is present-
at-hand; Being-in is not a characteristic that is effected, or even just elicited,
in a present-at-hand subject by the ‘world’s’ Being-present-at-hand; Being-
in is rather an essential kind of Being of this entity itself. But in that case,
what else is presented with this phenomenon than the commercium which is
present-at-hand between a subject present-at-hand and an Object present-at-
hand? Such an interpretation would come closer to the phenomenal content
if we were to say that Dasein is the Being of this ‘between’. Yet to take our

orientation from this ‘between’ would still be misleading. For with such an
orientation we would also be covertly assuming the entities between which
this “between”, as such, ‘is’, and we would be doing so in a way which is
ontologically vague. The “between” is already conceived as the result of the
convenientia  of  two  things  that  are  present-at-hand.  But  to  assume  these
beforehand always splits the phenomenon asunder, and there is no prospect
of  putting  it  together  again  from  the  fragments.  Not  only  do  we  lack  the
‘cement’; even the ‘schema’ in accordance with which this joining-together
is  to  be  accomplished,  has  been  split  asunder,  or  never  as  yet  unveiled.
What is decisive for ontology is to prevent the splitting of the phenomenon
—in  other  words,  to  hold  its  positive  phenomenal  content  secure.  To  say
that  for  this  we  need  far-reaching  and  detailed  study,  is  simply  to  express
the  fact  that  something  which  was  ontically  self-evident  in  the  traditional
way  of  treating  the  ‘problem  of  knowledge’  has  often  been  ontologically
disguised to the point where it has been lost sight of altogether.

The entity which is essentially constituted by Being-in-the-world is itself
in every case its ‘there’. According to the familiar signification of the word,
the  ‘there’  points  to  a  ‘here’  and  a  ‘yonder’.  The  ‘here’  of  an  ‘I-here’  is
always understood in relation to a ‘yonder’ ready-to-hand, in the sense of a
Being towards this ‘yonder’—a Being which is de-severant, directional, and
concernful.  Dasein’s  existential  spatiality,  which  thus  determines  its
‘location’,  is  itself  grounded  in  Being-in-the-world.  The  “yonder”  belongs
definitely to something encountered within-the-world. ‘Here’ and ‘yonder’
are possible only in a ‘there’—that is to say, only if there is an entity which
has made a disclosure of spatiality  as the  Being  of the  ‘there’.  This  entity
carries  in  its  ownmost  Being  the  character  of  not  being  closed  off.  In  the
expression ‘there’ we have in view this essential disclosedness. By reason
of this disclosedness, this entity (Dasein), together with the Being-there(1)
of the world, is ‘there’ for itself.

H. 133

 

When  we  talk  in  an  ontically  figurative  way  of  the  lumen  naturale  in
man,  we  have  in  mind  nothing  other  than  the  existential-ontological
structure of this entity, that it is in such a way as to be its “there”. To say
that it is ‘illuminated’ [“erleuchtet”] means that as Being-in-the-world  it is
cleared [gelichtet] in itself, not through any other entity, but in such a way

that  it  is  itself  the  clearing.(2)  Only  for  an  entity  which  is  existentially
cleared in this way does that which is present-at-hand become accessible in
the light or hidden in the dark. By its very nature, Dasein brings its “there”
along  with  it.  If  it  lacks  its  “there”,  it  is  not  factically  the  entity  which  is
essentially  Dasein;  indeed,  it  is  not  this  entity  at  all.  Dasein  is  its
disclosedness.
 

1. ‘Da-sein’. See our note 1, H. 7 above.
2.  ‘Lichtung’.  This  word  is  customarily  used  to  stand  for  a  ‘clearing’  in  the  woods,  not  for  a
‘clarification’; the verb ‘lichten’ is similarly used. The force of this passage lies in the fact that these
words are cognates of the noun ‘Licht’ (‘light’).

We  are  to  set  forth  the  Constitution  of  this  Being.  But  in  so  far  as  the
essence of this entity is existence, the existential proposition, ‘Dasein is its
disclosedness’, means at the same time that the Being which is an issue for
this entity in its very Being is to be its ‘there’. In addition to characterizing
the primary Constitution of the Being of disclosedness, we will require, in
conformity with the course of the analysis, an Interpretation of the kind of
Being in which this entity is its “there” in an everyday manner.

This chapter, in which we shall undertake the explication of Being-in as
such (that is to say, of the Being of the “there”), breaks up into two parts: A.
the  existential  Constitution  of  the  “there”;  B.  the  everyday  Being  of  the
“there”, and the falling of Dasein.

In  understanding  and  state-of-mind,  we  shall  see  the  two  constitutive
ways of being the “there”; and these are equiprimordial. If these are to be
analysed,  some  phenomenal  confirmation  is  necessary;  in  both  cases  this
will be attained by Interpreting some concrete mode which is important for
the  subsequent  problematic.  State-of-mind  and  understanding  are
characterized equiprimordially by discourse.

Under  A  (the  existential  Constitutuon  of  the  “there”)  we  shall
accordingly treat: Being-there as state-of-mind (Section 29); fear as a mode
of  state-of-mind  (Section  30);  Being-there  as  understanding  (Section  31);
understanding  and  interpretation  (Section  32);  assertion  as  a  derivative
mode  of  interpretation  (Section  33);  Being-there,  discourse,  and  language
(Section 34).

The  analysis  of  the  characteristics  of  the  Being  of  Being-there  is  an
existential  one.  This  means  that  the  characteristics  are  not  properties  of

 

 

 

something present-at-hand, but essentially existential ways to be. We must
therefore set forth their kind of Being in everydayness.

H. 134

Under B (the everyday Being of the “there”, and the falling of Dasein)
we  shall  analyse  idle  talk  (Section  35),  curiosity  (Section  36),  and
ambiguity  (Section  37)  as  existential  modes  of  the  everyday  Being  of  the
“there”;  we  shall  analyse  them  as  corresponding  respectively  to  the
constitutive  phenomenon  of  discourse, 
in
understanding,  and  the  interpretation  (or  explaining  [Deutung])  which
belongs to understanding. In these phenomenal modes a basic kind of Being
of the “there” will become visible—a kind of Being which we Interpret as
falling;  and  this  ‘falling’  shows  a  movement  [Bewegtheit]  which  is
existentially its own.(1)

A. The Existential Constitution of the “There”

29. Being there as State-of-mind

What  we  indicate  ontologically  by  the  term  “state-of-mind”(2)  is
ontically the most familiar and everyday sort of thing; our mood, our Being-
attuned.(3) Prior to all psychology of moods, a field which in any case still
lies  fallow,  it  is  necessary  to  see  this  phenomenon  as  a  fundamental
existentiale, and to outline its structure.
 

1.  While  we  shall  ordinarily  reserve  the  word  ‘falling’  for  ‘Verfallen’  (see  our  note  2,  H.  21
above), in this sentence it represents first ‘Verfallen’ and then ‘Fallen’, the usual German word for
‘falling’. ‘Fallen’ and ‘Verfallen’ are by no means strictly synonymous; the latter generally has the
further connotation of ‘decay’ or ‘deterioration’, though Heidegger will take pains to point out that in
his own usage it ‘does not express any negative evaluation’. See Section 38 below.

2. ‘Befindlichkeit’. More literally: ‘the state in which one may be found’. (The common German
expression ‘Wie befinden Sie sich?’ means simply ‘How are you?’ or ‘How are you feeling?’) Our
translation, ‘state-of-mind’, comes fairly close to what is meant; but it should be made clear that the
‘of-mind’ belongs to English idiom, has no literal counterpart in the structure of the German word,
and fails to bring out the important connotation of finding oneself.

3. ‘…die Stimmung, das Gestimmtsein.’ The noun ‘Stimmung’ originally means the tuning of a
musical instrument, but it has taken on several other meanings and is the usual word for one’s mood
or  humour.  We  shall  usually  translate  it  as  ‘mood’,  and  we  shall  generally  translate  both

‘Gestimmtsein’  and  ‘Gestimmtheit’  as  ‘having  a  mood’,  though  sometimes,  as  in  the  present
sentence,  we  prefer  to  call  attention  to  the  root  metaphor  of  ‘Gestimmtsein’  by  writing  ‘Being-
attuned’, etc.

Both  the  undisturbed  equanimity  and  the  inhibited  ill-humour  of  our
everyday  concern,  the  way  we  slip  over  from  one  to  the  other,  or  slip  off
into  bad  moods,  are  by  no  means  nothing  ontologically,(1)  even  if  these
phenomena  are  left  unheeded  as  supposedly  the  most  indifferent  and
fleeting in Dasein. The fact that moods can deteriorate [verdorben werden]
and change over means simply that in every case Dasein always has some
mood  [gestimmt 
lack  of  mood
ist].  The  pallid,  evenly  balanced 
[Ungestimmtheit], which is often persistent and which is not to be mistaken
for  a bad mood,  is  far  from nothing at  all. Rather,  it is  in  this that Dasein
becomes satiated with itself. Being has become manifest as a burden. Why
that should be, one does not know. And Dasein cannot know anything of the
sort because the possibilities of disclosure which belong to cognition reach
far  too  short  a  way  compared  with  the  primordial  disclosure  belonging  to
moods,  in  which  Dasein  is  brought  before  its  Being  as  “there”.
Furthermore, a mood of elation can alleviate the manifest burden of Being;
that  such  a  mood  is  possible  also  discloses  the  burdensome  character  of
Dasein, even while it alleviates the burden. A mood makes manifest ‘how
one is, and how one is faring’ [“wie einem ist und wird”]. In this ‘how one
is’, having a mood brings Being to its “there”.

H. 135

 

In having a mood, Dasein is always disclosed moodwise as that entity to
which  it  has  been  delivered  over  in  its  Being;  and  in  this  way  it  has  been
delivered  over  to  the  Being  which,  in  existing,  it  has  to  be.  “To  be
disclosed” does not mean “to be known as this sort of thing”. And even in
the most indifferent and inoffensive everydayness the Being of Dasein can
burst forth as a naked ‘that it is and has to be’ [als nacktes “Dass es es ist
und zu sein hat”].The pure ‘that it is’ shows itself, but the “whence” and the
“whither” remain  in  darkness.  The fact that it is  just as everyday  a matter
for Dasein not to ‘give in’ [“nachgibt”] to such moods—in other words, not
to  follow  up  [nachgeht]  their  disclosure  and  allow  itself  to  be  brought
before  that  which  is  disclosed—is  no  evidence  against  the  phenomenal
facts of the case, in which the Being of the “there” is disclosed moodwise in

its “that-it-is”;(2) it is rather evidence for it. In an ontico-existentiell sense,
Dasein for the most part evades the Being which is disclosed in the mood.
In  an  ontologico-existential  sense,  this  means  that  even  in  that  to  which
such  a  mood  pays  no  attention,  Dasein  is  unveiled  in  its  Being-delivered-
over to the “there”. In the evasion itself the “there” is something disclosed.
 

1. In this sentence ‘equanimity’ represents ‘Gleichmut’, ‘ill-humour’ represents ‘Missmut’, and

‘bad moods’ represents ‘Verstimmungen’.

2. ‘…den phänomenalen Tatbestand der stimmungsmässigen Erschlossenheit des Seins des Da in
seinem Dass...’ It would be more literal to write simply ‘in its “that” ’; but to avoid a very natural
confusion  between  the  conjunction  ‘that’  and  pronoun  ‘that’,  we  shall  translate  ‘das  Dass’  as  ‘the
“that-it-is” ’, even though we use the same expression unhyphenated for ‘das “Dass es ist” ’ in this
paragraph  and  in  that  which  follows.  (The  striking  contrast  between  the  ‘Da’  and  the  ‘Dass’  is  of
course lost in translation.)

This  characteristic  of  Dasein’s  Being—this  ‘that  it  is’—is  veiled  in  its
“whence” and “whither”, yet disclosed in itself all the more unveiledly; we
call it the “thrownness”(1) of this entity into its “there”; indeed, it is thrown
in such a way that, as Being-in-the-world, it is the “there”. The expression
“thrownness” is meant to suggest the facticity of its being delivered over.(2)
The ‘that it is and has to be’ which is disclosed in Dasein’s state-of-mind is
not  the  same  ‘that-it-as’  which  expresses  ontologico-categorially  the
factuality belonging to presence-at-hand. This factuality becomes accessible
only if we ascertain it by looking at it. The “that-it-is” which is disclosed in
Dasein’s  state-of-mind  must  rather  be  conceived  as  an  existential  attribute
of the entity which has Being-in-the-world as its way of Being. Facticity is
not the factuality of the  f a c t u m  b r u t u  m  of  something  present-at-
hand, but a characteristic of Dasein’s Being—one which has been taken up
into existence, even if proximally it has been thrust aside. The “that-it-is” of
facticity never becomes something that we can come across by beholding it.
An  entity  of  the  character  of  Dasein  is  its  “there”  in  such  a  way  that,
whether explicitly or not, it finds itself [sich befindet] in its thrownness. In a
state-of-mind Dasein is always brought before itself, and has always found
itself, not in the sense of coming across itself by perceiving itself, but in the
sense  of  finding  itself  in  the  mood  that  it  has.(3)  As  an  entity  which  has
been delivered over to its Being, it remains also delivered over to the fact
that it must always have found itself—but found itself in a way of finding
which arises not so much from a direct seeking as rather from a fleeing. The
way  in  which  the  mood  discloses  is  not  one  in  which  we  look  at

thrownness,  but  one  in  which  we  turn  towards  or  turn  away  [An-  und
Abkehr]. For the most part the mood does not turn towards the burdensome
character of Dasein which is manifest in it, and least of all does it do so in
the  mood  of  elation  when  this  burden  has  been  alleviated.  It  is  always  by
way of a state-of-mind that this turning-away is what it is.
 

1. ‘Geworfenheit’. This important term, which Heidegger introduces here, is further discussed in

Section 38.

2.  ‘Der  Ausdruck  Geworfenheit  soll  die  Faktizität  der  Überantwortung  andeuten.’  On  the

distinction between ‘facticity’ and ‘factuality’, see H. 56 above.

3. In this sentence there is a contrast between ‘wahrnehmendes Sich-vorfinden’ (‘coming across
itself by perceiving’) and ‘gestimmtes Sichbefinden’ (‘finding itself in the mood that it has’). In the
next sentence, on the other hand, ‘found’ and ‘finding’ represent ‘gefunden’ and ‘Finden’.

H. 136

 

Phenomenally,  we  would  wholly  fail  to  recognize  both  what  mood
discloses  and  how  it  discloses,  if  that  which  is  disclosed  were  to  be
compared with what Dasein is acquainted with, knows, and believes ‘at the
same time’ when it has such a mood. Even if Dasein is ‘assured’ in its belief
about  its  ‘whither’,  or  if,  in  rational  enlightenment,  it  supposes  itself  to
know  about  its  “whence”,  all  this  counts  for  nothing  as  against  the
phenomenal facts of the case: for the mood brings Dasein before the “that-
it-is”  of  its  “there”,  which,  as  such,  stares  it  in  the  face  with  the
inexorability  of  an  enigma.(1)  From  the  existential-ontological  point  of
view, there is not the slightest justification for minimizing what is ‘evident’
in  states-of-mind,  by  measuring  it  against  the  apodictic  certainty  of  a
theoretical  cognition  of  something  which  is  purely  present-at-hand.
However the phenomena are no less falsified when they are banished to the
sanctuary  of  the  irrational.  When  irrationalism,  as  the  counterplay  of
rationalism, talks about the things to which rationalism is blind, it does so
only with a squint.
 

1. ‘...so verschlägt das alles nichts gegen den phänomenalen Tatbestand, dass die Stimmung das
Dasein  vor  das  Dass  seines  Da  bringt,  als  welches  es  ihm  in  unerbittlicher  Rätselhaftigkeit
entgegenstarrt.’ The pronoun ‘es’ (the reference of which is not entirely unambiguous) appears only
in the later editions.

Factically,  Dasein  can,  should,  and  must,  through  knowledge  and  will,
become master of its moods; in certain possible ways of existing, this may

signify a priority of volition and cognition. Only we must not be misled by
this into denying that ontologically mood is a primordial kind of Being for
Dasein,  in  which  Dasein  is  disclosed  to  itself  prior  to  all  cognition  and
volition,  and beyond their  range  of  disclosure.  And  furthermore,  when  we
master a mood, we do so by way of a counter-mood; we are never free of
moods. Ontologically, we thus obtain as the first essential  characteristic  of
states-of-mind that they disclose Dasein in its thrownness, and—proximally
and for the most part—in the manner of an evasive turning-away.

From what has been said we can see already that a state-of-mind is very
remote from anything like coming across a psychical condition by the kind
of  apprehending  which  first  turns  round  and  then  back.  Indeed  it  is  so  far
from  this,  that  only  because  the  “there”  has  already  been  disclosed  in  a
state-of-mind  can  immanent  reflection  come  across  ‘Experiences’  at  all.
The 
the  “there”  more  primordially,  but
correspondingly it closes it off more stubbornly than any not-perceiving.

‘bare  mood’  discloses 

H. 137

 

This  is  shown  by  bad moods.  In  these,  Dasein  becomes  blind  to  itself,
the environment with which it is concerned veils itself, the circumspection
of  concern  gets  led  astray.  States-of-mind  are  so  far  from  being  reflected
upon,  that  precisely  what  they  do  is  to  assail  Dasein  in  its  unreflecting
devotion to the ‘world’ with which it is concerned and on which it expends
itself. A mood assails us. It comes neither from ‘outside’ nor from ‘inside’,
but arises out of Being-in-the-world, as a way of such Being. But with the
negative distinction between state-of-mind and the reflective apprehending
of  something  ‘within’,  we  have  thus  reached  a  positive  insight  into  their
character  as  disclosure.  The  mood  has  already  disclosed,  in  every  case,
Being-in-the-world  as  a  whole,  and  makes  it  possible  first  of  all  to  direct
oneself towards something. Having a mood is not related to the psychical in
the  first  instance,  and  is  not  itself  an  inner  condition  which  then  reaches
forth in an enigmatical way and puts its mark on Things and persons. It is in
this  that  the  second essential  characteristic  of  states-of-mind  shows  itself.
We  have  seen 
the  world,  Dasein-with,  and  existence  are
equiprimordially  disclosed; and  state-of-mind  is  a  basic  existential  species
of their dislosedness, because this disclosedness itself is essentially Being-
in-the-world.(1)

that 

Besides these two essential characteristics of states-of-mind which have
been explained—the disclosing of thrownness and the current disclosing of
Being-in-the-world  as  a  whole—we  have  to  notice  a  third,  which
contributes  above  all  towards  a  more  penetrating  understanding  of  the
worldhood  of  the  world.  As  we  have  said  earlier,(iii)  the  world  which  has
already  been  disclosed  beforehand  permits  what  is  within-the-world  to  be
encountered. This prior disclosedness of the world belongs to Being-in and 
is  partly  constituted  by  one’s  state-of-mind.  Letting  something  be
encountered is primarily circumspective; it is not just sensing something, or
staring  at  it.  It  implies  circumspective  concern,  and  has  the  character  of
becoming affected in some way [Betroffenwerdens]; we can see this more
precisely  from  the  standpoint  of  state-of-mind.  But  to  be  affected  by  the
unserviceable,  resistant,  or  threatening  character  [Bedrohlichkeit]  of  that
which  is  ready-to-hand,  becomes  ontologically  possible  only  in  so  far  as
Being-in  as  such  has  been  determined  existentially  beforehand  in  such  a
manner  that  what  it  encounters  within-the-world  can  “matter” to it  in  this
way. The fact that this sort of thing can “matter” to it is grounded in one’s
state-of-mind; and as a state-of-mind it has already disclosed the world—as
something  by  which  it  can  be  threatened,  for  instance.(2)  Only  something
which is in the state-of-mind of fearing (or fearlessness) can discover that
what is environmentally ready-to-hand is threatening. Dasein’s openness to
the world is constituted existentially by the attunement of a state-of-mind.
 

iii. Cf. Section 18, H. 83 ff.

1. ‘…weil diese selbst wesenhaft In-der-Welt-sein ist.’ It is not clear whether the antecedent of

‘diese’ is ‘Existenz’ (‘existence’) or ‘Erschlossenheit’ (‘disclosedness’).

2. ‘Diese Angänglichkeit gründet in der Befindlichkeit, als welche sie die Welt zum Beispiel auf

Bedrohbarkeit hin erschlossen hat.’ The pronoun ‘sie’ appears only in the newer editions.

 

 

H. 138

And only because the ‘senses’ [die “Sinne”] belong ontologically to an
entity  whose  kind  of  Being  is  Being-in-the-world  with  a  state-of-mind,(1)
can they be ‘touched’ by anything or ‘have a sense for’ [“Sinn haben für”]
something in such a way that what touches them shows itself in an affect.(2)
Under  the  strongest  pressure  and  resistance,  nothing  like  an  affect  would
remain  essentially
come  about,  and 

itself  would 

resistance 

the 

undiscovered, if Being-in-the-world, with its state-of-mind, had not already
submitted itself [sich schon angewiesen] to having entities within-the-world
“matter”  to  it  in  a  way  which  its  moods  have  outlined  in  advance.
Existentially,  a  state-of-mind  implies  a  disclosive  submission  to  the  world,
out  of  which  we  can  encounter  something  that  matters  to  us.  Indeed from
the  ontological  point  of  view  we  must  as  a  general  principal  leave  the
primary discovery  of  the  world  to  ‘bare  mood’.  Pure  beholding,  even  if  it
were to penetrate to the innermost core of the Being of something present-
at-hand, could never discover anything like that which is threatening.
 

1. ‘befindlichen In-der-Welt-seins’. In previous chapters we have usually translated ‘befindlich’
by such expressions as ‘which is to be found’, etc. See, for instance, H. 67, 70, 117 above, where this
adjective is applied to a number of things which are hardly of the character of Dasein. In the present
chapter,  however,  the  word  is  tied  up  with  the  special  sense  of  ‘Befindlichkeit’  as  ‘state-of-mind’,
and will be translated by expressions such as ‘with a state-of-mind’, ‘having a state-of-mind’, etc.

2.  In  this  sentence  Heidegger  has  been  calling  attention  to  two  ways  of  using  the  word  ‘Sinn’
which might well be expressed by the word ‘sense’ but hardly by the word ‘meaning’: (1) ‘die Sinne’
as ‘the five senses’ or the ‘senses’ one has when one is ‘in one’s senses’; (2) ‘der Sinn’ as the ‘sense’
one  has  ‘for’  something—one’s  ‘sense  for  clothes’,  one’s  ‘sense  of  beauty’,  one’s  ‘sense  of  the
numinous’, etc. Cf. the discussion of ‘Sinn’ on H. 151 f. below.

The  fact  that,  even  though  states-of-mind  are  primarily  disclosive,
everyday  circumspection  goes  wrong  and  to  a  large  extent  succumbs  to
delusion because of them, is a μὴ ὄν [non-being] when measured against the
idea of knowing the ‘world’ absolutely. But if we make evaluations which
are  so  unjustified  ontologically,  we  shall  completely  fail  to  recognize  the
existentially  positive  character  of  the  capacity  for  delusion.  It  is  precisely
when  we  see  the  ‘world’  unsteadily  and  fitfully  in  accordance  with  our
moods, that the ready-to-hand shows itself in its specific worldhood, which
is never the same from day to day. By looking at the world theoretically, we
have already dimmed it down to the uniformity of what is purely present-at-
hand,  though  admittedly  this  uniformity  comprises  a  new  abundance  of
things which can be discovered by simply characterizing them. Yet even the
purest θεωρία [theory] has not left all moods behind it; even when we look
theoretically at what is just present-at-hand, it does not show itself purely as
it  looks  unless  this  θεωρία  lets  it  come  towards  us  in  a  tranquil  tarrying
alongside..., in ῥαστώνη and διαγωγή.(iv) Any cognitive determining has its
existential-ontological  Constitution  in  the  state-of-mind  of  Being-in-the-
world;  but  pointing  this  out  is  not  to  be  confused  with  attempting  to
surrender science ontically to ‘feeling’.

The  different  modes  of  state-of-mind  and  the  ways  in  which  they  are
interconnected  in  their  foundations  cannot  be  Interpreted  within  the
problematic  of  the  present  investigation.  The  phenomena  have  long  been
well-known  ontically  under  the  terms  “affects”  and  “feelings”  and  have
always been under consideration in philosophy. It is not an accident that the
earliest systematic Interpretation of affects that has come down to us is not
treated  in  the  framework  of  ‘psychology’.  Aristotle  investigates  the  πάθη
[affects]  in  the  second  book  of  his  Rhetoric.  Contrary  to  the  traditional
orientation, according to which rhetoric is conceived as the kind of thing we
‘learn in school’, this work of Aristotle must be taken as the first systematic
hermeneutic of the everydayness of Being with one another. Publicness, as
the kind of Being which belongs to the “they” (Cf. Section 27), not only has
in  general  its  own  way  of  having  a  mood,  but  needs  moods  and  ‘makes’
them for itself. It is into such a mood and out of such a mood that the orator
speaks.  He  must  understand  the  possibilities  of  moods  in  order  to  rouse
them and guide them aright.
 

iv. Cf. Aristotle, Metaphysica A 2, 982 b 22 sqq. [‘comfort and recreation’—Ross].

H. 139

 

How the Interpretation of the affects was carried further in the Stoa, and
how it was  handed down to  modern  times through  patristic and scholastic
theology,  is  well  known.  What  has  escaped  notice  is  that  the  basic
ontological  Interpretation  of  the  affective  life  in  general  has  been  able  to
make scarcely one forward step worthy of mention since Aristotle. On the
contrary,  affects  and  feelings  come  under  the  theme  of  psychical
phenomena,  functioning  as  a  third  class  of  these,  usually  along  with
ideation [Vorstellen] and volition. They sink to the level of accompanying
phenomena.

It  has  been  one  of  the  merits  of  phenomenological  research  that  it  has
again brought these phenomena more unrestrictedly into our sight. Not only
that:  Scheler,  accepting  the  challenges  of  Augustine  and  Pascal,(v)  has
guided the problematic to a consideration of how acts which ‘represent’ and
acts  which  ‘take  an  interest’  are  interconnected  in  their  foundations.  But
even here the existential-ontological foundations of the phenomenon of the
act in general are admittedly still obscure.

A  state-of-mind  not  only  discloses  Dasein  in  its  thrownness  and  its
submission to that world which is already disclosed with its own Being; it is
itself  the  existential  kind  of  Being  in  which  Dasein  constantly  surrenders
itself  to  the  ‘world’  and  lets  the  ‘world’  “matter”  to  it  in  such  a  way  that
somehow  Dasein  evades  its  very  self.  The  existential  constitution  of  such
evasion will become clear in the phenomenon of falling.
 

v. Cf. Pascal, Pensées, [ed. Brunschvicg, Paris, p. 185]. ‘Et de là vient qu’au lieu qu’en parlant
des choses humaines on dit qu’il faut les connaître avant que de les aimer, ce qui a passé en proverbe,
les saints au contraire disent en parlant des choses divines qu’il faut les aimer pour les connaître, et
qu’on  n’entre  dans  la  vérité  que  par  la  charité,  dont  ils  ont  fait  une  de  leurs  plus  utiles  sentences.’
[‘And thence it comes about that in the case where we are speaking of human things, it is said to be
necessary to know them before we love them, and this has become a proverb; but the saints, on the
contrary, when they speak of divine things, say that we must love them before we know them, and
that we enter into truth only by charity; they have made of this one of their most useful maxims’.—
Tr.] Cf. with this, Augustine, Opera, (Migne Patrologiae Latinae, tom. VIII), Contra Faustum, lib. 32,
cap. 18: ‘non intratur in veritatem, nisi per charitatem.’ [‘one does not enter into truth except through
charity’.—Tr.]

H. 140

 

A state-of-mind is a basic existential way in which Dasein is its “there”.
It  not  only  characterizes  Dasein  ontologically,  but,  because  of  what  it
discloses, it is at the same time methodologically significant in principle for
the existential analytic. Like any ontological Interpretation whatsoever, this
analytic  can  only,  so  to  speak,  “listen  in”  to  some  previously  disclosed
entity  as  regards  its  Being.  And  it  will  attach  itself  to  Dasein’s  distinctive
and most far-reaching possibilities of disclosure, in order to get information
about this entity from these. Phenomenological Interpretation must make it
possible for Dasein itself to disclose things primordially; it must, as it were,
let  Dasein  interpret  itself.  Such  Interpretation  takes  part  in  this  disclosure
only in order to raise to a conceptual level the phenomenal content of what
has been disclosed, and to do so existentially.

Later (Cf. Section 40)(1) we shall provide an Interpretation of anxiety as
such a basic state-of-mind of Dasein, and as one which is significant from
the  existential-ontological  standpoint;  with  this  in  view,  we  shall  now
illustrate  the  phenomenon  of  state-of-mind  even  more  concretely  in  its
determinate mode of fear.

30. Fear as a Mode of Stale-of-Mind

 

vi. Cf. Aristotle, Rhetorica B 5, 1382 a 20—1383 b II.

There are three points of view from which the phenomenon of fear may
be considered. We shall analyse: (1) that in  the  face  of which we  fear, (2)
fearing, and (3) that about which we fear. These possible ways of looking at
fear  are  not  accidental;  they  belong  together.  With  them  the  general
structure  of  states-of-mind  comes  to  the  fore.  We  shall  complete  our
analysis  by  alluding  to  the  possible  ways  in  which  fear  may  be  modified;
each of these pertains to different items in the structure of fear.

That  in  the  face  of  which  we  fear,  the  ‘fearsome’,(2)  is  in  every  case
something which we encounter within-the-world and which may have either
readiness-to-hand,  presence-at-hand,  or  Dasein-with  as  its  kind  of  Being.
We are not going to make an ontical report on those entities which can often
and  for  the  most  part  be  ‘fearsome’:  we  are  to  define  the  fearsome
phenomenally  in  its  fearsomeness.  What  do  we  encounter  in  fearing  that
belongs to the fearsome as such? That in the face of which we fear can be
characterized  as  threatening.  Here  several  points  must  be  considered.  1.
What we encounter has detrimentality as its kind of involvement. It shows
itself within a context of involvements. 2. The target of this detrimentality is
a definite range of what can be affected by it; thus the detrimentality is itself
made definite, and comes from a definite region. 3. The region itself is well
known  as  such,  and  so  is  that  which  is  coming  from  it;  but  that  which  is
coming  from  it  has  something  ‘queer’  about  it.(3)  4.  That  which  is
detrimental,  as  something  that  threatens  us,  is  not  yet  within  striking
distance  [in  beherrschbarer  Nähe],  but  it  is  coming  close.  In  such  a
drawing-close, 
its
the  detrimentality  radiates  out,  and 
threatening  character.  5.  This  drawing-close  is  within  what  is  close  by.
Indeed, something may be detrimental in the highest degree and may even
be  coming  constantly  closer;  but  if  it  is  still  far  off,  its  fearsomeness
remains  veiled.  If,  however,  that  which  is  detrimental  draws  close  and  is
close  by,  then  it  is  threatening:  it  can  reach  us,  and  yet  it  may  not.  As  it
draws close, this ‘it can, and yet in the end it may not’ becomes aggravated.
We say, “It is fearsome”. 6. This implies that what is detrimental as coming-
close close by carries with it the patent possibility that it may stay away and

therein 

lies 

pass  us  by;  but  instead  of  lessening  or  extinguishing  our  fearing,  this
enhances it.
 

1. The earliest editions cite Section 39 rather than Section 40. This has been corrected in the list

of errata.

2. ‘Das Wovor der Furcht, das Furchtbare…’
3. ‘…mit dem es nicht “geheuer” ist.’

H. 141

 

In  fearing  as  such,  what  we  have  thus  characterized  as  threatening  is
freed  and  allowed  to  matter  to  us.  We  do  not  first  ascertain  a  future  evil
(malum futurum) and then fear it. But neither does fearing first take note of
what is drawing close; it discovers it beforehand in its fearsomeness. And in
fearing, fear can then look at the fearsome explicitly, and ‘make it clear’ to
itself. Circumspection sees the fearsome because it has fear as its state-of-
mind. Fearing, as a slumbering possibility of Being-in-the-world in a state-
of-mind  (we  call  this  possibility  ‘fearfulness’  [“Furchtsamkeit”]),  has
already  disclosed  the  world,  in  that  out  of  it  something  like  the  fearsome
may  come  close.  The  potentiality  for  coming  close  is  itself  freed  by  the
essential existential spatiality of Being-in-the-world.

That which fear fears about is that very entity which is afraid—Dasein.
(1) Only an entity for which in its Being this very Being is an issue, can be
afraid. Fearing discloses this entity as endangered and abandoned to itself.
Fear always reveals Dasein in the Being of its “there”, even if it does so in
varying degrees of explicitness. If we fear about our house and home, this
cannot be cited as an instance contrary to the above definition of what we
fear  about;  for  as  Being-in-the-world,  Dasein  is  in  every  case  concernful
Being-alongside.(2) Proximally and for the most part, Dasein is in terms of
what  it  is  concerned  with.  When  this  is  endangered,  Being-alongside  is
threatened.  Fear  discloses  Dasein  predominantly  in  a  privative  way.  It
bewilders us and makes us ‘lose our heads’. Fear closes off our endangered
Being-in, and yet at the same time lets us see it, so that when the fear has
subsided, Dasein must first find its way about again.

Whether  privatively  or  positively,  fearing  about  something,  as  being-
afraid  in  the  face  of  something,  always  discloses  equiprimordially  entities
within-the-world and Being-in—the former as threatening and the latter as
threatened. Fear is a mode of state-of-mind.

1. ‘Das Worum die Furcht fürchtet, ist das sich fürchtende Seiende selbst, das Dasein.’ While it is
convenient to translate ‘das Worum der Furcht’ as ‘that which one fears about’, this expression must
be taken in a narrower sense than one would ordinarily expect in English. What Heidegger generally
has in mind is rather the person on whose behalf or for  whose sake one  fears.  (Cf.  our  remarks  on
‘um’  in  note  1,  H.  65,  and  note  2,  H.  69  above.)  Thus  ‘fürchten  um’  comes  closer  to  the  ordinary
meaning of ‘fear for’ than it does to that of ‘fear about’. We shall soon see, however, that Heidegger
also uses the expression ‘fürchten für’, for which ‘fear for’ would seem to be the natural translation.
Notice  that  what  he  then  has  in  mind—namely,  our  fearing  for  Others—is  only  a  special  case  of
‘fearing  for’  in  the  ordinary  English  sense,  and  likewise  only  a  special  case  of  what  we  shall  call
‘fearing about’ in this translation.

2. ‘Sein bei’. Here our usual translation, ‘Being-alongside’, fails to bring out the connection. A
German reader would recall at once that ‘bei’ may mean, ‘at the home of’ like the French ‘chez’. See
our note 3, H. 54 above.

 

 

H. 142

One can also fear about Others, and we then speak of “fearing for” them
[Fürchten  für  sie].  This  fearing  for  the  Other  does  not  take  away  his  fear.
Such a possibility has been ruled out already, because the Other, for whom
we fear, need not fear at all on his part. It is precisely when the Other is not
afraid and charges recklessly at what is threatening him that we fear most
for him. Fearing-for is a way of having a co-state-of-mind with Others, but
not  necessarily  a  being-afraid-with  or  even  a  fearing-with-one-another.(1)
One  can  “fear  about”  without  “being-afraid”.  Yet  when  viewed  more
strictly,  fearing-about  is  “being-afraid-for-oneself”.(2)  Here  what  one  “is
apprehensive about” is one’s Being-with with the Other, who might be torn
away from one.(3) That which is fearsome is not aimed directly at him who
fears  with  someone  else.  Fearing-about  knows  that  in  a  certain  way  it  is
unaffected, and yet it is co-affected in so far as the Dasein-with for which it
fears  is  affected.  Fearing-about  is  therefore  not  a  weaker  form  of  being-
afraid. Here the issue is one of existential modes, not of degrees of ‘feeling-
tones’.  Fearing-about  does  not  lose  its  specific  genuiness  even  if  it  is  not
‘really’ afraid.
 

1. ‘Fürchten für... ist eine Weise der Mitbefindlichkeit mit den Anderen, aber nicht notwendig ein

Sich-mitfürchten oder gar ein Miteinanderfürchten.’

2.  ‘ein  Sichfürchten’.  We  have  hitherto  translated  ‘sich  fürchten’  with  various  forms  of  ‘be
afraid’, which is its usual signification in ordinary German. In this passage, however, the emphasis on
the reflexive pronoun ‘sich’ clearly calls for ‘being-afraid-for-oneself’.

3. ‘ “Befürchtet” ist dabei das Mitsein mit dem Anderen, der einem entrissen werden könnte.’

There can be variations in the constitutive items of the full phenomenon
of  fear.  Accordingly,  different  possibilities  of  Being  emerge  in  fearing.
Bringing-close  close  by,  belongs  to  the  structure  of  the  threatening  as
encounterable. If something threatening breaks in suddenly upon concernful
Being-in-the-world  (something  threatening  in  its  ‘not  right  away,  but  any
moment’), fear becomes alarm [Erschrecken]. So, in what is threatening we
must distinguish between the closest way in which it brings itself close, and
the manner in which this bringing-close gets encountered—its suddenness.
That  in  the  face  of  which  we  are  alarmed  is  proximally  something  well
known and familiar. But if, on the other hand, that which threatens has the
character  of  something  altogether  unfamiliar,  then  fear  becomes  dread
[Grauen].  And  where  that  which  threatens  is  laden  with  dread,  and  is  at
same  time  encountered  with  suddenness  of  alarming,  then  fear  becomes
terror [Entsetzen]. There  are  further  variations  of  fear,  which  we  know  as
timidity,  shyness,  misgiving,  becoming  startled.  All  modifications  of  fear,
as  possibilities  of  having  a  state-of-mind,  point  to  the  fact  that  Dasein  as
Being-in-the-world is ‘fearful’ [“furchtsam”]. This ‘fearfulness’ is not to be
understood in an ontical sense as some factical ‘individualized’ disposition,
(1) but as an existential possibility of the essential state-of-mind of Dasein
in general, though of course it is not the only one.
 

1.  ‘…im  ontischen  Sinne  einer  faktischen,  “vereinzelten”  Veranlagung...’  While  the  verb
‘vereinzeln’  often  means  ‘to  isolate’,  Heidegger  does  not  ordinarily  use  it  in  this  sense.  Indeed  he
contrasts it with the verb ‘isolieren’. Cf. H. 188 below.

31. Being-there as Understanding

 

 

H. 143

State-of-mind is one of  the  existential  structures  in  which  the  Being  of
the ‘there’ maintains itself. Equiprimordial with it in constituting this Being
is understanding. A  state-of-mind  always  has  its  understanding,  even  if  it
merely  keeps  it  suppressed.  Understanding  always  has  its  mood.  If  we
Interpret understanding as a fundamental existentiale, this indicates that this
phenomenon is conceived as a basic mode of Dasein’s Being. On the other
hand, ‘understanding’ in the sense of one possible kind of cognizing among
others  (as  distinguished,  for  instance,  from  ‘explaining’),  must,  like

explaining,  be  Interpreted  as  an  existential  derivative  of  that  primary
understanding which is one of the constituents of the Being of the “there” in
general.

We have, after all, already come up against this primordial understanding
in  our  previous  investigations,  though  we  did  not  allow  it  to  be  included
explicitly in the theme under discussion. To say that in existing, Dasein is
its “there”, is equivalent to saying that the world is ‘there’; its Being-there is
Being-in.  And  the  latter  is  likewise  ‘there’,  as  that  for  the  sake  of  which
Dasein  is.  In  the  “for-the-sake-of-which”,  existing  Being-in-the-world  is
disclosed  as  such,  and  this  disclosedness  we  have  called  “understanding”.
(vii)  In  the  understanding  of  the  “for-the-sake-of-which”,  the  significance
which is grounded therein, is disclosed along with it. The disclosedness of
understanding,  as  the  disclosedness  of  the  “for-the-sake-of-which”  and  of
significance equiprimordially, pertains to the entirety of Being-in-the-world.
Significance is that on the basis of which the world is disclosed as such. To
say that the “for-the-sake-of-which” and significance  are  both  disclosed in
Dasein, means that Dasein is that entity which, as Being-in-the-world, is an
issue for itself.

When  we  are  talking  ontically  we  sometimes  use  the  expression
‘understanding something’ with the signification of ‘being able to manage
something’, ‘being a match for it’, ‘being competent to do something’.(1) In
understanding, as an existentiale, that which we have such competence over
is not a “what”, but Being as existing. The kind of Being which Dasein has,
as  potentiality-for-Being,  lies  existentially  in  understanding.  Dasein  is  not
something  present-at-hand  which  possesses  its  competence  for  something
by way of an extra; it is primarily Being-possible. Dasein is in every case
what  it  can  be,  and  in  the  way  in  which  it  is  its  possibility.  The  Being-
possible which is essential for Dasein, pertains to the ways of its solicitude
for  Others  and  of  its  concern  with  the  ‘world’,  as  we  have  characterized
them;  and  in  all  these,  and  always,  it  pertains  to  Dasein’s  potentiality-for-
Being  towards  itself,  for  the  sake  of  itself.  The  Being-possible  which
Dasein  is  existentially  in  every  case,  is  to  be  sharply  distinguished  both
from  empty  logical  possibility  and  from  the  contingency  of  something
present-at-hand, so far as with the present-at-hand this or that can ‘come to
pass’.(2)  As  a  modal  category  of  presence-at-hand,  possibility  signifies
what is not yet actual and what is not at any time necessary. It characterizes
the merely possible.  Ontologically  it is  on a lower level  than  actuality  and

necessity.  On  the  other  hand,  possibility  as  an  existentiale  is  the  most
primordial  and  ultimate  positive  way  in  which  Dasein  is  characterized
ontologically. As with existentiality in general, we can, in the first instance,
only  prepare  for  the  problem  of  possibility.  The  phenomenal  basis  for
seeing it at all is provided by the understanding as a disclosive potentiality-
for-Being.
 

vii. Cf. Section 18, H. 85 ff.

H. 144

 

Possibility,  as  an  existentiale,  does  not  signify  a  free-floating
potentiality-for-Being  in  the  sense  of  the  ‘liberty  of  indifference’  (libertas
indifferentiae). In every case Dasein, as essentially having a state-of-mind,
has already got itself into definite possibilities. As the potentiality-for-Being
which is is, it has let such possibilities pass by; it is constantly waiving the
possibilities of its Being, or else it seizes upon them and makes mistakes.(3)
But this means that Dasein is Being-possible which has been delivered over
to itself—thrown  possibility through  and through.  Dasein is  the  possibility
of Being-free for its  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being.  Its  Being-possible  is
transparent to itself in different possible ways and degrees.
 

1.  ‘…in  der  Bedeutung  von  “einer  Sache  vorstehen  können”,  “ihr  gewachsen  sein”,  “etwas
können”.’  The  expression  ‘vorstehen’  (‘to  manage’,  ‘to  be  in  charge’)  is  here  connected  with
‘verstehen’ (‘to understand’).

2. ‘…von der Kontingenz eines Vorhandenen, sofern mit diesem das und jenes “passieren” kann.’
3. ‘...ergreift sie und vergreift sich.’
Understanding  is  the  Being  of  such  potentiality-for-Being,  which  is
never something still outstanding as not yet present-at-hand, but which, as
something which is essentially never present-at-hand, ‘is’ with the Being of
Dasein,  in  the  sense  of  existence.  Dasein  is  such  that  in  every  case  it  has
understood (or alternatively, not understood) that it is to be thus or thus. As
such  understanding  it  ‘knows’  what  it  is  capable  of—that  is,  what  its
potentiality-for-Being  is  capable  of.(1)  This  ‘knowing’  does  not  first  arise
from an immanent self-perception, but belongs to the Being of the “there”,
which 
in
understanding,  is  its  “there”,  can  it  go  astray  and  fail  to  recognize  itself.
And in so far as understanding is accompanied by state-of-mind and as such

is  essentially  understanding.  And  only  because  Dasein, 

is existentially surrendered to thrownness, Dasein has in every case already
gone astray and failed to recognize itself. In its potentiality-for-Being it is
therefore delivered over to the possibility of first finding itself again in its
possibilities.

Understanding is the existential Being of Dasein’s own potentiality-for-
Being; and it is so in such a way that this Being discloses in itself what its
Being is capable of.(2) We must grasp the structure of this existenliale more
precisely.
 

1. ‘Als solches Verstehen “weiss” es, woran es mit ihm selbst, das heisst seinem Seinkönnen ist.’
2. ‘…so zwar, dass dieses Sein an ihm selbst das Woran des mit ihm selbst Seins erschliesst.’

H. 145

 

As  a disclosure, understanding always pertains  to  the  whole basic state
of  Being-in-the-world.  As  a  potentiality-for-Being,  any  Being-in  is  a
potentiality-for-Being-in-the-world.  Not  only  is  the  world,  qua  world,
disclosed as possible significance, but when that which is within-the-world
is  itself  freed,  this  entity  is  freed  for  its  own  possibilities.  That  which  is
ready-to-hand is discovered as such in its serviceability, its usability, and its
detrimentality.  The  totality  of  involvements  is  revealed  as  the  categorical
whole  of  a  possible  interconnection  of  the  ready-to-hand.  But  even  the
‘unity’ of the manifold present-at-hand, of Nature, can be discovered only if
a possibility of it has been disclosed. Is it accidental that the question about
the Being  of Nature  aims  at  the  ‘conditions of its possibility’? On what is
such an inquiry based? When confronted with this inquiry, we cannot leave
aside the question: why are entities which are not of the character of Dasein
understood  in  their  Being,  if  they  are  disclosed  in  accordance  with  the
conditions  of  their  possibility?  Kant  presupposes  something  of  the  sort,
perhaps  rightly.  But  this  presupposition  itself  is  something  that  cannot  be
left without demonstrating how it is justified.

Why does the understanding—whatever may be the essential dimensions
of  that  which  can  be  disclosed  in  it—always  press  forward  into
possibilities?  It  is  because  the  understanding  has  in  itself  the  existential
structure  which  we  call  “projection”.(1)  With  equal  primordiality  the
understanding  projects  Dasein’s  Being  both  upon  its  “for-the-sake-of-
which”  and  upon  significance,  as  the  worldhood  of  its  current  world.  The

character  of  understanding  as  projection  is  constitutive  for  Being-in-the-
world with regard to the disclosedness of its existentially constitutive state-
of-Being  by  which  the  factical  potentiality-for-Being  gets  its  leeway
[Spielraum]. And as thrown, Dasein is thrown into the kind of Being which
we call “projecting”. Projecting has nothing to do with comporting oneself
towards  a  plan  that  has  been  thought  out,  and  in  accordance  with  which
Dasein  arranges  its  Being.  On  the  contrary,  any  Dasein  has,  as  Dasein,
already projected itself; and as long as it is, it is projecting. As long as it is,
Dasein  always  has  understood  itself  and  always  will  understand  itself  in
terms  of  possibilities.  Furthermore,  the  character  of  understanding  as
projection  is  such  that  the  understanding  does  not  grasp  thematically  that
upon  which  it  projects—that  is  to  say,  possibilities.  Grasping  it  in  such  a
manner  would  take  away  from  what  is  projected  its  very  character  as  a
possibility,  and  would  reduce  it  to  the  given  contents  which  we  have  in
mind;  whereas  projection,  in  throwing,  throws  before  itself  the  possibility
as possibility, and lets it be as such.(2) As projecting, understanding is the
kind of Being of Dasein in which it is its possibilities as possibilities.
 

1.  ‘Entwurf’.  The  basic  meaning  of  this  noun  and  the  cognate  verb  ‘entwerfen’  is  that  of
‘throwing’  something  ‘off’  or  ‘away’  from  one;  but  in  ordinary  German  usage,  and  often  in
Heidegger, they take on the sense of ‘designing’ or ‘sketching’ some ‘project’ which is to be carried
through; and they may also be used in the more special sense of ‘projection’ in which a geometer is
said  to  ‘project’  a  curve  ‘upon’  a  plane.  The  words  ‘projection’  and  ‘project’  accordingly  lend
themselves  rather  well  to  translating  these  words  in  many  contexts,  especially  since  their  root
meanings  are  very  similar  to  those  of  ‘Entwurf’  and  ‘entwerfen’;  but  while  the  root  meaning  of
‘throwing off’ is still very much alive in Heidegger’s German, it has almost entirely died out in the
ordinary English usage of ‘projection’ and ‘project’, which in turn have taken on some connotations
not felt in the German. Thus when in the English translation Dasein is said to ‘project’ entities, or
possibilities, or even its own Being ‘upon’ something, the reader should bear in mind that the root
meaning of ‘throwing’ is more strongly felt in the German than in the translation.

2. ‘…zieht es herab zu einem gegebenen, gemeinten Bestand, während der Entwurf im Werfen
die Möglichkeit als Möglichkeit sich vorwirft und als solche sein lässt.’ The expression ‘einem etwas
vorwerfen’ means literally to ‘throw something forward to someone’, but often has the connotation
of  ‘reproaching  him  with  something’,  or  ‘throwing  something  in  his  teeth’.  Heidegger  may  have
more than one of these significations in mind.

Because of the kind of Being which is constituted by the existentiale of
projection,  Dasein  is  constantly  ‘more’  than  it  factually  is,  supposing  that
one might want to make an inventory of it as something-at-hand and list the
contents of its Being, and supposing that one were able to do so. But Dasein
is  never  more  than  it  factically  is,  for  to  its  facticity  its  potentiality-for-

Being belongs essentially. Yet as Being-possible, moreover, Dasein is never
anything less; that is to say, it is existentially that which, in its potentiality-
for-Being,  it is not  yet. Only  because the  Being  of the  “there” receives  its
the  character  of
Constitution 
understanding  as  projection,  only  because  it  is  what  it  becomes  (or
alternatively, does not become), can it say to itself ‘Become what you are’,
and say this with understanding.

Projection  always  pertains  to  the  full  disclosedness  of  Being-in-the-
world;  as  potentiality-for-Being,  understanding  has  itself  possibilities,
which  are  sketched  out  beforehand  within  the  range  of  what  is  essentially
disclosable  in  it.  Understanding  can  devote  itself  primarily  to  the
dislosedness of the world; that is, Dasein can, proximally and for the most
part,  understand  itself  in  terms  of  its  world.  Or  else  understanding  throws
itself  primarily  into  the  “for-the-sake-of-which”;  that  is,  Dasein  exists  as
itself.  Understanding  is  either  authentic,  arising  out  of  one’s  own  Self  as
such, or inauthentic. The  ‘in-’ of “inauthentic” does not  mean  that Dasein
cuts  itself  off  from  its  Self  and  understands  ‘only’  the  world.  The  world
belongs  to  Being-one’s-Self  as  Being-in-the-world.  On  the  other  hand,
authentic understanding, no less than that which is inauthentic, can be either
genuine  or  not  genuine.  As  potentiality-for-Being,  understanding  is
into
altogether  permeated  with  possibility.  When  one 
[Sichverlegen in] one of these basic possibilities of understanding, the other
is  not  laid  aside  [legt...  nicht  ab].  Because  understanding,  in  every  case,
pertains  rather  to  Dasein’s  full  disclosedness  as  Being-in-the-world,  this
diversion  of  the  understanding  is  an  existential  modification  of  projection
as  a  whole.  In  understanding  the  world,  Being-in  is  always  understood
along  with  it,  while  understanding  of  existence  as  such  is  always  an
understanding of the world.

is  diverted 

As  factical  Dasein, any Dasein has already diverted  its potentiality-for-

Being into a possibility of understanding.

In  its  projective  character,  understanding  goes  to  make  up  existentially
what we call Dasein’s “sight” [Sicht]. With the disclosedness of the “there”,
this  sight   i  s    existentially  [existenzial  seiende];  and  Dasein  is  this  sight
equiprimordially  in  each  of  those  basic  ways  of  its  Being  which  we  have

already  noted:  as  the  circumspection  [Umsicht]  of  concern,  as  the
considerateness [Rücksicht] of solicitude, and as that sight which is directed
upon Being as such [Sicht auf das Sein als solches], for the sake of which
any Dasein is as it is. The sight which is related primarily and on the whole
to existence we call “transparency” [Durchsichiigkeit]. We choose this term
to designate ‘knowledge of the Self(1) in a sense which is well understood,
so as to indicate that here it is not a matter of perceptually tracking down
and inspecting a point called the “Self”, but rather one of seizing upon the
full  disclosedness  of  Being-in-the-world  throughout  all  the  constitutive
items which are essential to it, and doing so with understanding. In existing,
entities  sight  ‘themselves’  [sichtet  “sich”]  only  in  so  far  as  they  have
become  transparent  to  themselves  with  equal  primordiality  in  those  items
which  are  constitutive  for  their  existence:  their  Being-alongside  the  world
and their Being-with Others.

On  the  other  hand,  Dasein’s  opaqueness  [Undurchsichtigkeit]  is  not
rooted primarily and solely in ‘egocentric’ self-deceptions; it is rooted just
as much in lack of acquaintance with the world.
 

1. ‘ “Selbsterkenntnis” ’. This should be carefully distinguished from the ‘Sichkennen’ discussed
on  H.  124-125.  Perhaps  this  distinction  can  be  expressed—though  rather  crudely—by  pointing  out
that we are here concerned with a full and sophisticated knowledge of the Self in all its implications,
while  in  the  earlier  passage  we  were  concerned  with  the  kind  of  ‘self-knowledge’  which  one  loses
when one ‘forgets oneself’ or does something so out of character that one ‘no longer knows oneself’.

H. 147

 

We must, to be sure, guard against a misunderstanding of the expression
‘sight’. It corresponds to the “clearedness” [Gelichtetheit] which we took as
characterizing the disclosedness of the “there”. ‘Seeing’ does not mean just
perceiving with the bodily eyes, but neither does it mean pure non-sensory
awareness  of  something  present-at-hand  in  its  presence-at-hand.  In  giving
an  existential  signification  to  “sight”,  we  have  merely  drawn  upon  the
peculiar  feature  of  seeing,  that  it  lets  entities  which  are  accessible  to  it  be
encountered  unconcealedly  in  themselves.  Of  course,  every  ‘sense’  does
this within that domain of discovery which is genuinely its own. But from
the  beginning  onwards  the  tradition  of  philosophy  has  been  oriented
primarily towards ‘seeing’ as a way of access to entities and  to  Being.  To
keep  the  connection  with  this  tradition,  we  may  formalize  “sight”  and

“seeing” enough to obtain therewith a universal term for characterizing any
access to entities or to Being, as access in general.

is  understanding  as  common 

By  showing  how  all  sight  is  grounded  primarily  in  understanding  (the
sense
circumspection  of  concern 
[Verständigkeit]),  we  have  deprived  pure  intuition  [Anschauen]  of  its
priority, which corresponds noetically to the priority of the present-at-hand
in  traditional  ontology.  ‘Intuition’  and  ‘thinking’  are  both  derivatives  of
understanding, and already rather remote ones. Even the phenomenological
in  existential
‘intuition  of  essences’  [“Wesensschau”] 
understanding.  We  can  decide  about  this  kind  of  seeing  only  if  we  have
obtained explicit conceptions of Being and of the structure of Being, such
as only phenomena in the phenomenological sense can become.

is  grounded 

The  disclosedness  of  the  “there”  in  understanding  is  itself  a  way  of
Dasein’s potentiality-for-Being. In the  way  in  which  its  Being  is  projected
both  upon  the  “for-the-sake-of-which”  and  upon  significance  (the  world),
there lies the disclosedness of Being in general. Understanding of Being has
already  been  taken  for  granted  in  projecting  upon  possibilities.  In
projection,  Being  is  understood,  though  not  ontologically  conceived.  An
entity whose kind of Being is the essential projection of Being-in-the-world
has understanding of Being, and has this as constitutive for its Being. What
was  posited  dogmatically  at  an  earlier  stage(viii)  now  gets  exhibited  in
terms of the Constitution of the Being in which Dasein as understanding is
its  “there”.  The  existential  meaning  of  this  understanding  of  Being  cannot
be satisfactorily clarified within the limits of this investigation except on the
basis of the Temporal Interpretation of Being.
 

viii. Cf. Section 4, H. 11 ff.

H. 148

 

As  existentialia,  states-of-mind  and  understanding  characterize  the
primordial disclosedness of Being-in-the-world. By way of having a mood,
Dasein  ‘sees’  possibilities,  in  terms  of  which  it  is.  In  the  projective
disclosure  of  such  possibilities,  it  already  has  a  mood  in  every  case.  The
projection of its ownmost potentiality-for-Being has been delivered over to
the Fact of its thrownness into the “there”. Has not Dasein’s Being become
more enigmatical now that we have explicated the existential constitution of

the Being of the “there” in the sense of thrown projection? It has indeed. We
must first let the full enigmatical character of this Being emerge, even if all
we  can  do  is  to  come  to  a  genuine  breakdown  over  its  ‘solution’,  and  to
formulate anew the question about the Being of thrown projective Being-in-
the-world.

But  in  the  first  instance,  even  if  we  are  just  to  bring  into  view  the
everyday  kind  of  Being  in  which  there  is  understanding  with  a  state-of-
mind, and if we are to do so in a way which is phenomenally adequate to
the  full  disclosedness  of  the  “there”,  we  must  work  out  these  existentialia
concretely.(1)

32. Understanding and Interpretation

 

2. ‘Auslegung’. See our note 3, H. 1 above.

As  understanding,  Dasein  projects  its  Being  upon  possibilities.  This
Being-towards-possibilities  which  understands  is  itself  a  potentiality-for-
Being, and it is so because of the way these possibilities, as disclosed, exert
their  counter-thrust  [Rückschlag]  upon  Dasein.  The  projecting  of  the
understanding  has  its  own  possibility—that  of  developing  itself  [sich
the  understanding  we  call
auszubilden].  This  development  of 
“interpretation”.(3)  In  it  the  understanding  appropriates  understandingly
that  which  is  understood  by  it.  In  interpretation,  understanding  does  not
become  something  different.  It  becomes  itself.  Such  interpretation  is
grounded  existentially  in  understanding;  the  latter  does  not  arise  from  the
former.  Nor  is  interpretation  the  acquiring  of  information  about  what  is
understood;  it  is  rather  the  working-out  of  possibilities  projected  in
understanding. In accordance with the trend of these preparatory analyses of
everyday  Dasein,  we  shall  pursue  the  phenomenon  of  interpretation  in
understanding the world—that is, in inauthentic understanding, and indeed
in the mode of its genuineness.

In  terms  of  the  significance  which  is  disclosed  in  understanding  the
world,  concernful  Being-alongside  the  ready-to-hand  gives  itself  to
understand whatever involvement that which is encountered can have.(1) To
say  that  “circumspection  discovers”  means  that  the  ‘world’  which  has
already been understood comes to be interpreted. The ready-to-hand comes
explicitly into the sight which understands. All preparing, putting to rights,
repairing, improving, rounding-out, are accomplished in the following way:
we take apart(2) in its “in-order-to” that which is circumspectively ready-to-
hand,  and  we  concern  ourselves  with  it  in  accordance  with  what  becomes
visible  through  this  process.  That  which  has  been  circumspectively  taken
apart with regard to its “in-order-to”, and taken apart as such—that which is
explicitly  understood—has  the  structure  of  something  as  something.  The
circumspective  question  as  to  what  this  particular  thing  that  is  ready-to-
hand may be, receives the circumspectively interpretative answer that it is
for  such  and  such  a  purpose  [es  ist  zum...].  If  we  tell  what  it  is  for  [des
Wozu],  we  are  not  simply  designating  something;  but  that  which  is
designated  is  understood  as  that  as  which  we  are  to  take  the  thing  in
question.  That  which  is  disclosed  in  understanding—that  which  is
understood—is already accessible in such a way that its ‘as which’ can be
made  to  stand  out  explicitly.  The  ‘as’  makes  up  the  structure  of  the
explicitness  of  something 
the
interpretation.  In  dealing  with  what  is  environmentally  ready-to-hand  by
interpreting it circumspectively, we ‘see’ it as a table, a door, a carriage, or
a  bridge;  but  what  we  have  thus  interpreted  [Ausgelegte]  need  not
necessarily  be  also  taken  apart  [auseinander  zu  legen]  by  making  an
assertion which definitely characterizes it. Any mere pre-predicative seeing
of the ready-to-hand is, in itself, something which already understands and
interprets. But does not the absence of such an ‘as’ make up the mereness of
any pure perception of something? Whenever we see with this kind of sight,
we  already  do  so  understandingly  and  interpretatively.  In  the  mere
encountering  of  something,  it  is  understood  in  terms  of  a  totality  of
involvements;  and  such  seeing  hides  in  itself  the  explicitness  of  the
assignment-relations (of the “in-order-to”) which belong to that totality.
 

is  understood. 

It  constitutes 

that 

1. ‘…gibt sich... zu verstehen, welche Bewandtnis es je mit dem Begegnenden haben kann.’
2. ‘auseinandergelegt’. Heidegger is contrasting the verb ‘auslegen’ (literally, ‘lay out’) with the

cognate ‘auseinanderlegen’ (‘lay asunder’ or ‘take apart’).

That  which  is  understood  gets  Articulated  when  the  entity  to  be
understood  is  brought  close  interpretatively  by  taking  as  our  clue  the
‘something  as  something’;  and  this  Articulation  lies  before  [liegt vor]  our
making  any  thematic  assertion  about  it.  In  such  an  assertion  the  ‘as’  does
not turn up for the first time; it just gets expressed for the first time, and this
is  possible  only  in  that  it  lies  before  us  as  something  expressible.(1)  The
fact  that  when  we  look  at  something,  the  explicitness  of  assertion  can  be
absent,  does  not  justify  our  denying  that  there  is  any  Articulative
interpretation in such mere seeing, and hence that there is any as-structure
in  it.  When  we  have  to  do  with  anything,  the  mere  seeing  of  the  Things
which are closest to us bears in itself the structure of interpretation, and in
so primordial a manner that just to grasp something free, as it were, of  the
“as”, requires a certain readjustment. When we merely stare at something,
our just-having-it-before-us lies before us as a failure to understand it any
more. This grasping which is free of the “as”, is a privation of the kind of
seeing in which one merely understands. It is not more primordial than that
kind  of  seeing,  but  is  derived  from  it.  If  the  ‘as’  is  ontically  unexpressed,
this  must  not  seduce  us  into  overlooking  it  as  a  constitutive  state  for
understanding, existential and a priori.
 

1. ‘…was allein so möglich ist, dass es als Aussprechbares vor-liegt.’ Here we follow the reading
of the earlier editions. The hyphen in ‘vor-liegt’ comes at the end of the line in the later editions, but
is undoubtedly meant to suggest (like the italicization of the ‘vor’ in the previous sentence) that this
verb is to be interpreted with unusual literalness.

This paragraph is noteworthy for an exploitation of the prefix ‘aus’ (‘out’), which fails to show
up  in  our  translation.  Literally  an  ‘Aussage’  (‘assertion’)  is  something  which  is  ‘said  out’;  an
‘Auslegung’ (‘interpretation’) is a ‘laying-out’; that which is ‘ausdrücklich’ (‘explicit’) is something
that has been ‘pressed out’; that which is ‘aussprechbar’ (our ‘expressible’) is something that can be
‘spoken out’.

The verbs ‘ausdrücken’ and ‘aussprechen’ are roughly synonymous; but ‘aussprechen’ often has
the  more  specific  connotations  of  ‘pronunciation’,  ‘pronouncing  oneself’,  ‘speaking  one’s  mind’,
‘finishing what one has to say’, etc. While it would be possible to reserve ‘express’ for ‘ausdrücken’
and translate ‘aussprechen’ by some such phrase as ‘speak out’, it is more convenient to use ‘express’
for both verbs, especially since ‘aussprechen’ and its derivatives have occurred very seldom before
the  present  chapter,  in  which  ‘ausdrücken’  rarely  appears.  On  the  other  hand,  we  can  easily
distinguish between the more frequent ‘ausdrücklich’ and ‘ausgesprochen’ by translating the latter as
‘expressed’ or ‘expressly’, and reserving ‘explicit’ for both ‘ausdrücklich’ and ‘explizit’.

interpreting 

if  such  perception 

But if we never perceive equipment that is ready-to-hand without already
understanding  and 
lets  us
it,  and 
circumspectively  encounter  something  as  something,  does  this  not  mean
that in the first instance we have experienced something purely present-at-
hand,  and  then  taken  it  as  a  door,  as  a  house?  This  would  be  a
misunderstanding  of  the  specific  way  in  which  interpretation  functions  as
disclosure.  In  interpreting,  we  do  not,  so  to  speak,  throw  a  ‘signification’
over some naked thing which is present-at-hand, we do not stick a value on
it; but when something within-the-world is encountered as such, the thing in
question  already  has  an 
in  our
understanding of the world, and this involvement is one which gets laid out
by the interpretation.(1)

involvement  which 

is  disclosed 

The  ready-to-hand  is  always  understood  in  terms  of  a  totality  of
involvements.  This  totality  need  not  be  grasped  explicitly  by  a  thematic
interpretation.  Even  if  it  has  undergone  such  an  interpretation,  it  recedes
into an understanding which does not stand out from the background. And
this  is  the  very  mode  in  which  it  is  the  essential  foundation  for  everyday
circumspective interpretation. In every case this interpretation is grounded
in something we have in advance—in a fore-having.(2) As the appropriation
of understanding, the interpretation operates in Being towards a totality of
involvements  which  is  already  understood—a  Being  which  understands.
When something is understood but is still veiled, it becomes unveiled by an
act of appropriation, and this is always done under the guidance of a point
of view, which fixes that with regard to which what is understood is to be
interpreted. In every case interpretation is grounded in something we see in
advance—in a fore-sight. This fore-sight ‘takes the first cut’ out of what has
been taken into our fore-having, and it does so with a view to a definite way
in  which  this  can  be  interpreted.(3)  Anything  understood  which  is  held  in
our  fore-having  and  towards  which  we  set  our  sights  ‘foresightedly’,

conceived can be drawn from the entity itself or the interpretation can force
the  entity  into  concepts  to  which  it  is  opposed  in  its  manner  of  Being.  In
either  case,  the  interpretation  has  already  decided  for  a  definite  way  of
conceiving  it,  either  with  finality  or  with  reservations;  it  is  grounded  in
something we grasp in advance—in a fore-conception.

1. ‘…die durch die Auslegung herausgelegt wird.’
2.  In  this  paragraph  Heidegger  introduces  the  important  words  ‘Vorhabe’,  ‘Vorsicht’,  and
‘Vorgriff’.  ‘Vorhabe’  is  perhaps  best  translated  by  some  such  expression  as  ‘what  we  have  in
advance’  or  ‘what  we  have  before  us’;  but  we  shall  usually  find  it  more  convenient  to  adopt  the
shorter  term  ‘fore-having’,  occasionally  resorting  to  hendiadys,  as  in  the  present  sentence,  and  we
shall handle the other terms in the same manner. ‘Vorsicht’ (‘what we see in advance’ or ‘fore-sight’)
is  the  only  one  of  these  expressions  which  occurs  in  ordinary  German  usage,  and  often  has  the
connotation  of  ‘caution’  or  ‘prudence’;  Heidegger,  however,  uses  it  in  a  more  general  sense
somewhat  more  akin  to  the  English  ‘foresight’,  without  the  connotation  of  a  shrewd  and  accurate
prediction.  ‘Vorgriff’  (‘what  we  grasp  in  advance’  or  ‘fore-conception’)  is  related  to  the  verb
‘vorgreifen’ (‘to anticipate’) as well as to the noun “Begriff”.

3.  ‘Die  Auslegung  gründet  jeweils  in  einer  Vorsicht,  die  das  in  Vorhabe  Genommene  auf  eine
bestimmte Auslegbarkeit hin “anschneidet”.’ The idea seems to be that just as the person who cuts
off the first slice of a loaf of bread gets the loaf ‘started’, the fore-sight ‘makes a start’ on what we
have in advance—the fore-having.

Whenever something is interpreted as something, the interpretation will
be  founded  essentially  upon  fore-having,  fore-sight,  and  fore-conception.
An interpretation is never a presuppositionless apprehending of something
presented to us.(1) If, when one is engaged in a particular concrete kind of
interpretation,  in  the  sense  of  exact  textual  Interpretation,  one  likes  to
appeal  [beruft]  to  what  ‘stands  there’,  then  one  finds  that  what  ‘stands
there’  in  the  first  instance  is  nothing  other  than  the  obvious  undiscussed
assumption  [Vormeinung]  of  the  person  who  does  the  interpreting.  In  an
interpretative  approach  there  lies  such  an  assumption,  as  that  which  has
been ‘taken for granted’ [“gesetzt”] with the interpretation as such—that is
to say, as that which has been presented in our fore-having, our fore-sight,
and our fore-conception.
 

1. ‘…eines Vorgegebenen.’ Here, as in many other passages, we have translated ‘vorgeben’ by
various  forms  of  the  verb  ‘to  present’;  but  it  would  perhaps  be  more  in  line  with  Heidegger’s
discussion of the prefix ‘vor-’ to write ‘...of something fore-given’.

H. 151

 

How are we to conceive the character of this ‘fore’? Have we done so if
we say formally that this is something ‘a priori’? Why does understanding,
which  we  have  designated  as  a  fundamental  exisientiale  of  Dasein,  have
this  structure  as  its  own?  Anything  interpreted,  as  something  interpreted,
has  the  ‘as’-structure  as  its  own;  and  how  is  this  related  to  the  ‘fore’
structure?  The  phenomenon  of  the  ‘as’-structure  is  manifestly  not  to  be
dissolved or broken up ‘into pieces’. But is a primordial analytic for it thus

ruled  out?  Are  we  to  concede  that  such  phenomena  are  ‘ultimates’?  Then
there  would  still  remain  the  question,  “why?”  Or  do  the  fore-structure  of
understanding  and  the  as-structure  of  interpretation  show  an  existential-
ontological  connection  with  the  phenomenon of projection?  And does this
phenomenon point back to a primordial state of Dasein’s Being?

Before we answer these questions, for which the preparation up till now
has been far from sufficient, we must investigate whether what has become
visible  as  the  fore-structure  of  understanding  and  the  as-structure  of
interpretation, does not itself already present us with a unitary phenomenon
—one of which copious use is made in philosophical problematics, though
what  is  used  so  universally  falls  short  of  the  primordiality  of  ontological
explication.

In  the  projecting  of  the  understanding,  entities  are  disclosed  in  their
possibility. The character of the possibility corresponds, on each occasion,
with  the  kind  of  Being  of  the  entity  which  is  understood.  Entities  within-
the-world generally are projected upon the world—that is, upon a whole of
significance,  to  whose  reference-relations  concern,  as  Being-in-the-world,
has been tied up in advance. When entities within-the-world are discovered
along  with  the  Being  of  Dasein—that  is,  when  they  have  come  to  be
understood—we  say  that  they  have  meaning  [Sinn].  But  that  which  is
understood, taken strictly, is not the meaning but the entity, or alternatively,
Being.  Meaning  is  that  wherein  the  intelligibility  [Verständlichkeit]  of
something maintains itself. That which can be Articulated in a disclosure by
which  we  understand,  we  call  “meaning”.  The  concept  of  meaning
embraces  the  formal  existential  framework  of  what  necessarily  belongs  to
that  which  an  understanding  interpretation  Articulates.  Meaning  is  the
“upon-which”  of  a  projection  in  terms  of  which  something  becomes
intelligible  as  something;  it  gets  its  structure  from  a  fore-having,  a  fore-
sight,  and  a 
fore-conception.(1)  In  so  far  as  understanding  and
interpretation  make  up  the  existential  state  of  Being  of  the  “there”,
“meaning”  must  be  conceived  as  the  formal-existential  framework  of  the
disclosedness which belongs to understanding. Meaning is an existentiale of
Dasein, not a property attaching to entities, lying ‘behind’ them, or floating
somewhere as an ‘intermediate domain’. Dasein only ‘has’ meaning, so far
as the disclosedness of Being-in-the-world can be ‘filled in’ by the entities
discoverable in that disclosedness.(2) Hence only Dasein can be meaningful
[sinnvoll] or meaningless [sinnlos]. That  is  to  say,  its  own  Being  and  the

entities  disclosed  with  its  Being  can  be  appropriated  in  understanding,  or
can remain relegated to non-understanding.
 

1.  ‘Sinn  ist  des  durch  Vorhabe,  Vorsicht  und  Vorgiff  strukturierte  Woraufhin  des  Entwurfs,  aus
dem her etwas als etwas verständlich wird.’ (Notice that our usual translation of ‘verständlich, and
‘Verständlichkeit’ as ‘intelligible’ and ‘intelligibility’, fails to show the connection of the words with
‘Verständnis’,  etc.  This  connection  could  have  been  brought  out  effectively  by  writing
‘understandable,’ ‘understandability’, etc., but only at the cost of awkwardness.)

2. ‘Sinn “hat” nur das Dasein, sofern die Erschlossenheit des In-der-Welt-seins durch das in ihr
entdeckbare Seiende “erfüllbar” ist.’ The point of this puzzling and ambiguous sentence may become
somewhat clearer if the reader recalls that here as elsewhere (see H. 75 above) the verb ‘erschliessen’
(‘disclose’) is used in the sense of ‘opening something up’ so that its contents can be ‘discovered’.
What thus gets ‘opened up’ will then be ‘filled in’ as more and more of its contents get discovered.

H. 152

 

This  Interpretation  of  the  concept  of  ‘meaning’  is  one  which  is
ontologico-existential in principle; if we adhere to it, then all entities whose
kind  of  Being  is  of  a  character  other  than  Dasein’s  must  be  conceived  as
unmeaning  [unsinniges],  essentially  devoid  of  any  meaning  at  all.  Here
‘unmeaning’ does not signify that we are saying anything about the value of
such  entities,  but  it  gives  expression  to  an  ontological  characteristic.  And
only that which is unmeaning can be absurd [widersinnig]. The present-at-
hand,  as  Dasein  encounters  it,  can,  as  it  were,  assault  Dasein’s  Being;
natural events, for instance, can break in upon us and destroy us.

And  if  we  are  inquiring  about  the  meaning  of  Being,  our  investigation
does not then become a “deep” one [tiefsinnig], nor does it puzzle out what
stands behind Being. It asks about Being itself in so far as Being enters into
the intelligibility of Dasein. The meaning of Being can never be contrasted
with entities, or with Being as the ‘ground’ which gives entities support; for
a ‘ground’ becomes accessible only as meaning, even if it is itself the abyss
of meaninglessness.(1)
 

1. ‘Der Sinn von Sein kann nie in Gegensatz gebracht werden zum Seienden oder zum Sein als
tragenden “Grund” des Seienden, weil “Grund” nur als Sinn zugänglich wird, und sei er selbst der
Abgrund  der  Sinnlosigkeit.’  Notice  the  etymological  kinship  between  ‘Grund’  (‘ground’)  and
‘Abgrund’ (‘abyss’).

 

As the disclosedness of the “there”, understanding always pertains to the
whole  of  Being-in-the-world.  In  every  understanding  of  the  world,

existence is understood with it, and vice versa. All interpretation, moreover,
operates  in  the  fore-structure,  which  we  have  already  characterized.  Any
interpretation  which  is  to  contribute  understanding,  must  already  have
understood  what  is  to  be  interpreted.  This  is  a  fact  that  has  always  been
remarked, even if only in the area of derivative ways of understanding and
interpretation, such as philological Interpretation. The latter belongs within
the range of scientific knowledge. Such knowledge demands the rigour of a
demonstration  to  provide  grounds  for  it.  In  a  scientific  proof,  we  may  not
presuppose what it is our task to provide grounds for. But if interpretation
must in any case already operate in that which is understood, and if it must
draw  its  nurture  from  this,  how  is  it  to  bring  any  scientific  results  to
maturity  without  moving  in  a  circle,  especially  if,  moreover,  the
understanding  which  is  presupposed  still  operates  within  our  common
information about man and the world? Yet according to the most elementary
rules  of  logic,  this  circle is  a circulus vitiosus.  If  that  be  so,  however,  the
business  of  historiological  interpretation  is  excluded  a  priori  from  the
domain  of  rigorous  knowledge.  In  so  far  as  the  Fact  of  this  circle  in
understanding is not eliminated, historiology must then be resigned to less
rigorous possibilities of knowing. Historiology is permitted to compensate
for  this  defect  to  some  extent  through  the  ‘spiritual  signification’  of  its
‘objects’.  But  even  in  the  opinion  of  the  historian  himself,  it  would
admittedly  be  more  ideal  if  the  circle  could  be  avoided  and  if  there
remained the hope of creating some time a historiology which would be as
independent of the standpoint of the observer as our knowledge of Nature is
supposed to be.

H. 153

 

But  if  we  see  this  circle  as  a  vicious  one  and  look  out  for  ways  of
avoiding it, even if we just ‘sense’ it as an inevitable imperfection, then the
act  of  understanding  has  been  misunderstood  from  the  ground  up.  The
assimilation  of  understanding  and  interpretation  to  a  definite  ideal  of
knowledge is not the issue here. Such an ideal is itself only a subspecies of
understanding—a  subspecies  which  has  strayed  into  the  legitimate  task  of
unintelligibility
in 
grasping 
[Unverständlichkeit].  If  the  basic  conditions  which  make  interpretation
possible  are  to  be  fulfilled,  this  must  rather  be  done  by  not  failing  to

present-at-hand 

essential 

the

recognize  beforehand  the  essential  conditions  under  which  it  can  be
performed. What is decisive is not to get out of the circle but to come into it
in the right way. This circle of understanding is not an orbit in which any
random kind of knowledge may move; it is the expression of the existential
fore-structure  of  Dasein  itself.  It  is  not  to  be  reduced  to  the  level  of  a
vicious circle, or even of a circle which is merely tolerated. In the circle is
hidden a positive possibility of the most primordial kind of knowing. To be
sure,  we  genuinely  take  hold  of  this  possibility  only  when,  in  our
interpretation,  we  have  understood  that  our  first,  last,  and  constant  task  is
never  to  allow  our  fore-having,  fore-sight,  and  fore-conception  to  be
presented to us by fancies and popular conceptions, but rather to make the
scientific theme secure by working out these fore-structures in terms of the
things themselves. Because understanding, in accordance with its existential
meaning, 
the  ontological
presuppositions of historiological knowledge transcend in principle the idea
of rigour held in the most exact sciences. Mathematics is not more rigorous
than  historiology,  but  only  narrower,  because  the  existential  foundations
relevant for it lie within a narrower range.

is  Dasein’s  own  potentiality-for-Being, 

The  ‘circle’  in  understanding  belongs  to  the  structure  of  meaning,  and
the latter phenomenon is rooted in the existential constitution of Dasein—
that is, in the understanding which interprets. An entity for which, as Being-
in-the-world,  its  Being  is  itself  an  issue,  has,  ontologically,  a  circular
structure. If, however, we note that ‘circularity’ belongs ontologically to a
kind of Being which is present-at-hand (namely, to subsistence [Bestand]),
we  must  altogether  avoid  using  this  phenomenon  to  characterize  anything
like Dasein ontologically.

33. Assertion as a Derivative Mode of Interpretation

 

 

H. 154

All  interpretation  is  grounded  on  understanding.  That  which  has  been
articulated(1)  as  such  in  interpretation  and  sketched  out  beforehand  in  the
understanding in general as something articulable, is the meaning. In so far
as assertion (‘judgment’)(2)  is  grounded on  understanding and presents us
with a derivative form in which an interpretation has been carried out, it too

‘has’  a  meaning.  Yet  this  meaning  cannot  be  defined  as  something  which
occurs ‘in’ [“an”] a judgment along with the judging itself. In our present
context, we shall give an explicit analysis of assertion, and this analysis will
serve several purposes.
 

1. ‘Gegliederte’. The verbs ‘artikulieren’ and ‘gliedern’ can both be translated by ‘articulate’ in
English; even in German they are nearly synonymous, but in the former the emphasis is presumably
on the ‘joints’ at which something gets divided, while in the latter the emphasis is presumably on the
‘parts’  or  ‘members’.  We  have  distinguished  between  them  by  translating  ‘artikulieren’  by
‘Articulate’ (with a capital ‘A’), and ‘gliedern’ by ‘articulate’ (with a lower-case initial).

2. ‘…die Aussage (das “Urteil”)…’

For one thing, it can be demonstrated, by considering assertion, in what
ways  the  structure  of  the  ‘as’,  which  is  constitutive  for  understanding  and
interpretation,  can  be  modified.  When 
this  has  been  done,  both
understanding  and  interpretation  will  be  brought  more  sharply  into  view.
For  another  thing,  the  analysis  of  assertion  has  a  special  position  in  the
problematic of fundamental ontology, because in the decisive period when
ancient  ontology  was  beginning,  the λόγος  functioned  as  the  only  clue  for
obtaining access to that which authentically  i s  [zum eigentlich Seienden],
and  for  defining  the  Being  of  such  entities.  Finally  assertion  has  been
accepted  from  ancient  times  as  the  primary  and  authentic  ‘locus’  of  truth.
The  phenomenon  of  truth  is  so  thoroughly  coupled  with  the  problem  of
Being that our investigation, as it proceeds further, will necessarily come up
against  the  problem  of  truth;  and  it already  lies  within  the  dimensions  of
that  problem,  though  not  explicitly.  The  analysis  of  assertion  will  at  the
same time prepare the way for this latter problematic.

In  what  follows,  we  give  three  significations  to  the  term  “assertion”.
These  are  drawn  from  the  phenomenon  which  is  thus  designated,  they  are
connected  among  themselves,  and  in  their  unity  they  encompass  the  full
structure of assertion.

1. The primary signification of “assertion” is “pointing out” [Aufzeigen].
In this we adhere to the primordial meaning of λόγος as ἀπόφανσις—letting
an  entity  be  seen  from  itself.  In  the  assertion  ‘The  hammer  is  too  heavy’,
what is discovered for sight is not a ‘meaning’, but an entity in the way that
it is ready-to-hand. Even if this entity is not close enough to be grasped and
‘seen’,  the  pointing-out  has  in  view  the  entity  itself  and  not,  let  us  say,  a
mere  “representation”  [Vorstellung]  of  it—neither  something  ‘merely

represented’ nor the psychical condition in which the person who makes the
assertion “represents” it.

H. 155

 

2.  “Assertion”  means  no  less  than  “predication”.  We  ‘assert’  a
‘predicate’  of  a  ‘subject’,  and  the  ‘subject’  is  given  a  definite  character
[bestimmt] by the ‘predicate’. In this signification of “assertion”, that which
is  put  forward  in  the  assertion  [Das  Ausgesagte]  is  not  the  predicate,  but
‘the hammer itself’. On the other hand, that which does the asserting [Das
Aussagende]  (in  other  words,  that  which  gives  something  a  definite
character) lies in the ‘too heavy’. That which is put forward in the assertion
in  the  second  signification  of  “assertion”  (that  which  is  given  a  definite
character, as such) has undergone a narrowing of content as compared with
what  is  put  forward  in  the  assertion  in  the  first  signification  of  this  term.
Every  predication  is  what  it  is,  only  as  a  pointing-out.  The  second
signification  of  “assertion”  has  its  foundation  in  the  first.  Within  this
pointing-out, the elements which are Articulated in predication—the subject
and predicate—arise. It is not by giving something a definite character that
we first discover that which shows itself—the hammer—as such; but when
we  give  it  such  a  character,  our  seeing  gets  restricted  to  it  in  the  first
instance,  so  that  by  this  explicit  restriction(1)  of  our  view,  that  which  is
already manifest may be made explicitly manifest in its definite character. In
giving something a definite character, we must, in the first instance, take a
step  back  when  confronted  with  that  which  is  already  manifest—the
hammer  that  is  too  heavy.  In  ‘setting  down  the  subject’,  we  dim  entities
down to focus in ‘that hammer there’, so that by thus dimming them down
we may let that which is manifest be seen in its own definite character as a
character that can be determined.(2) Setting down the subject, setting down
thoroughly
the  predicate,  and  setting  down 
‘apophantical’ in the strict sense of the word.

together,  are

the 

3.  “Assertion”  means  “communication”  [Mitteilung],  speaking  forth
[Heraussage]. As communication, it is directly related to “assertion” in the
first  and  second  significations.  It  is  letting  someone  see  with  us  what  we
have pointed out by way of giving it a definite character. Letting someone
see  with  us  shares  with  [teilt...  mit]  the  Other  that  entity  which  has  been
pointed  out  in  its  definite  character.  That  which  is  ‘shared’  is  our  Being

towards what has been pointed out—a Being in which we see it in common.
One must keep in mind that this Being-towards is Being-in-the-world, and
that from out of this very world what has been pointed out gets encountered.
Any  assertion,  as  a  communication  understood  in  this  existential  manner,
must have been expressed.(3) As something communicated, that which has
been put forward in the assertion is something that Others can ‘share’ with
the  person  making  the  assertion,  even  though  the  entity  which  he  has
pointed  out  and  to  which  he  has  given  a  definite  character  is  not  close
enough  for  them  to  grasp  and  see  it.  That  which  is  put  forward  in  the
assertion  is  something  which  can  be  passed  along  in  ‘further  retelling’.
There is a widening of the range of that mutual sharing which sees. But at
the same time, what has been pointed out may become veiled again in this
further  retelling,  although  even  the  kind  of  knowing  which  arises  in  such
hearsay (whether knowledge that something is the case [Wissen] or merely
an  acquaintance  with  something  [Kennen])  always  has  the  entity  itself  in
view  and  does  not  ‘give  assent’  to  some  ‘valid  meaning’  which  has  been
passed around. Even hearsay is a Being-in-the-world, and a Being towards
what is heard.

There is prevalent today a theory of ‘judgment’ which is oriented to the
phenomenon of ‘validity’.(1) We shall not give an extensive discussion of it
here. It will be sufficient to allude to the very questionable character of this
phenomenon of ‘validity’, though since the time of Lotze people have been
fond of passing this off as a ‘primal phenomenon’ which cannot be traced
back  any  further.  The  fact  that  it  can  play  this  role  is  due  only  to  its
ontologically unclarified character. The ‘problematic’ which has established
itself round this idolized word is no less opaque. In the first place, validity
is  viewed  as  the  ‘form’  of  actuality  which  goes  with  the  content  of  the
judgment,  in  so  far  as  that  content  remains  unchanged  as  opposed  to  the
changeable ‘psychical’ process of judgment. Considering how the status of
the question of Being in general has been characterized in the introduction

to this treatise, we would scarcely venture to expect that ‘validity’ as ‘ideal
Being’  is  distinguished  by  special  ontological  clarity.  In the  second  place,
“validity”  means  at  the  same  time  the  validity  of  the  meaning  of  the
judgment, which is valid of the ‘Object’ it has in view; and thus it attains
the  signification  of  an  ‘Objectively  valid  character’ and  of  Objectivity  in
general.  In  the  third  place,  the  meaning  which  is  thus  ‘valid’  of an  entity,
and which is valid ‘timelessly’ in itself, is said to be ‘valid’ also in the sense
of being valid for everyone who judges rationally. “Validity” now means a
bindingness,  or  ‘universally  valid’  character.(2)  Even  if  one  were  to
advocate a ‘critical’ epistemological theory, according to which the subject
does not ‘really’ ‘come out’ to the Object, then this valid character, as the
validity of an Object (Objectivity), is grounded upon that stock of true (!)
meaning  which  is  itself  valid.  The  three  significations  of  ‘being  valid’
which  we  have  set  forth—the  way  of  Being  of  the  ideal,  Objectivity,  and
bindingness—not  only  are  opaque  in  themselves  but  constantly  get
confused with one another. Methodological fore-sight demands that we do
not choose such unstable concepts as a clue to Interpretation. We make no
advance restriction upon the concept of “meaning” which would confine it
to  signifying  the  ‘content  of  judgment’,  but  we  understand  it  as  the
existential  phenomenon  already  characterized,  in  which  the  formal
framework  of  what  can  be  disclosed  in  understanding  and  Articulated  in
interpretation becomes visible.
 

1.  Heidegger  uses  three  words  which  might  conveniently  be  translated  as  ‘validity’:  ‘Geltung’
(our ‘validity’), ‘Gültigkeit’ (our ‘valid character’), and ‘Gelten’ (our ‘being valid’, etc.). The reader
who  has  studied  logic  in  English  and  who  accordingly  thinks  of  ‘validity’  as  merely  a  property  of
arguments  in  which  the  premisses  imply  the  conclusion,  must  remember  that  in  German  the  verb
‘gelten’  and  its  derivatives  are  used  much  more  broadly,  so  as  to  apply  to  almost  anything  that  is
commonly  (or  even  privately)  accepted,  so  that  one  can  speak  of  the  ‘validity’  of  legal  tender,  the
‘validity’ of a ticket for so many weeks or months, the ‘validity’ of that which ‘holds’ for me or for
you, the ‘validity’ of anything that is the case. While Heidegger’s discussion does not cover as many
of these meanings as will be listed in any good German dictionary, he goes well beyond the narrower
usage of the English-speaking logician. Of course, we shall often translate ‘gelten’ in other ways.

If we bring together the three significations of ‘assertion’ which we have
analysed,  and  get  a  unitary  view  of  the  full  phenomenon,  then  we  may
define  “assertion”  as  “a  pointing-out  which  gives  something  a  definite

character  and  which  communicates”.  It  remains  to  ask  with  what
justification we have taken assertion as a mode of interpretation at all. If it
is something of this sort, then the essential structures of interpretation must
recur in it. The pointing-out which assertion does is performed on the basis
of  what  has  already  been  disclosed  in  understanding  or  discovered
circumspectively. Assertion is not a free-floating kind of behaviour which,
in  its  own  right,  might  be  capable  of  disclosing  entities  in  general  in  a
primary  way:  on  the  contrary  it  always  maintains  itself  on  the  basis  of
Being-in-the-world. What we have shown earlier(ix) in relation to knowing
the  world,  holds  just  as  well  as  assertion.  Any  assertion  requires  a  fore-
having of whatever has been disclosed; and this is what it points out by way
of  giving  something  a  definite  character.  Furthermore,  in  any  approach
when one gives something a definite character, one is already taking a look
directionally  at  what is  to  be put  forward in  the  assertion. When an entity
which  has  been  presented  is  given  a  definite  character,  the  function  of
giving it such a character is taken over by that with regard to which we set
our sights towards the entity.(1) Thus any assertion requires a fore-sight; in
this  the  predicate  which  we  are  to  assign  [zuzuweisende]  and  make  stand
out, gets loosened, so to speak, from its unexpressed inclusion in the entity
itself.  To  any  assertion  as  a  communication  which  gives  something  a
definite  character  there  belongs,  moreover,  an  Articulation  of  what  is
pointed out, and this Articulation is in accordance with significations. Such
an assertion will operate with a definite way of conceiving: “The hammer is
heavy”, “Heaviness belongs to the hammer”, “The hammer has the property
of heaviness”. When an assertion is made, some fore-conception is always
implied;  but  it  remains  for  the  most  part  inconspicuous,  because  the
language  already  hides  in  itself  a  developed  way  of  conceiving.  Like  any
interpretation whatever, assertion necessarily has a fore-having, a fore-sight,
and a fore-conception as its existential foundations.

But  to  what  extent  does  it  become  a derivative mode  of  interpretation?
What has been modified in it? We can point out the modification if we stick
to certain limiting cases of assertion which function in logic as normal cases

and  as  examples  of  the  ‘simplest’  assertion-phenomena.  Prior  to  all
analysis,  logic  has  already  understood  ‘logically’  what  it  takes  as  a  theme
under  the  heading  of  the  “categorical  statement”—for  instance,  ‘The
hammer is heavy’. The unexplained presupposition is that the ‘meaning’ of
this sentence is to be taken as: “This Thing—a hammer—has the property
of heaviness”. In concernful circumspection there are no such assertions ‘at
first’.  But  such  circumspection  has  of  course  its  specific  ways  of
interpreting,  and  these,  as  compared  with  the  ‘theoretical  judgment’  just
mentioned,  may  take  some  such  form  as  ‘The  hammer  is  too  heavy’,  or
rather  just  ‘Too  heavy!’,  ‘Hand  me  the  other  hammer!’  Interpretation  is
carried  out  primordially  not  in  a  theoretical  statement  but  in  an  action  of
circumspective concern—laying aside the unsuitable tool, or exchanging it,
‘without wasting words’. From the fact that words are absent, it may not be
concluded  that  interpretation  is  absent.  On  the  other  hand,  the  kind  of
interpretation  which  is  circumspectively  expressed  is  not  necessarily
already  an  assertion  in  the  sense  we  have  defined.  By  what  existential-
ontological  modifications  does  assertion  arise 
from  circumspective
interpretation?

H. 158

 

The entity which is held in our fore-having—for instance, the hammer—
is  proximally  ready-to-hand  as  equipment.  If  this  entity  becomes  the
‘object’  of  an  assertion,  then  as  soon  as  we  begin  this  assertion,  there  is
already  a  change-over  in  the  fore-having.  Something  ready-to-hand  with
which  we  have  to  do  or  perform  something,  turns  into  something  ‘about
which’ the  assertion  that  points  it  out  is  made.  Our  fore-sight  is  aimed  at
something  present-at-hand  in  what  is  ready-to-hand.  Both  by  and  for  this
way of looking at it [Hin-sicht], the ready-to-hand becomes veiled as ready-
to-hand. Within this discovering of presence-at-hand, which is at the same
time  a  covering-up  of  readiness-to-hand,  something  present-at-hand  which
we  encounter  is  given  a  definite  character  in  its  Being-present-at-hand-in-
such-and-such-a-manner.  Only  now  are  we  given  any  access  to  properties
or the like. When an assertion has given a definite character to something
present-at-hand, it says something about it as a  “what”;  and  this  “what”  is
drawn  from  that  which  is  present-at-hand  as  such.  The  as-structure  of
interpretation has undergone a modification. In its function of appropriating

what  is  understood,  the  ‘as’  no  longer  reaches  out  into  a  totality  of
involvements.  As  regards  its  possibilities  for  Articulating  reference-
relations,  it  has  been  cut  off  from  that  significance  which,  as  such,
constitutes  environmentality.  The  ‘as’  gets  pushed  back  into  the  uniform
plane of that which is merely present-at-hand. It dwindles to the structure of
just  letting  one  see  what  is  present-at-hand,  and  letting  one  see  it  in  a
definite  way.  This  levelling  of  the  primordial  ‘as’  of  circumspective
interpretation  to  the  “as”  with  which  presence-at-hand  is  given  a  definite
character is the specialty of assertion. Only so does it obtain the possibility
of exhibiting something in such a way that we just look at it.

Thus  assertion  cannot  disown 

from  an
interpretation  which  understands.  The  primordial  ‘as’  of  an  interpretation
(ἑρμηνεία)  which  understands  circumspectively  we  call  the  “existential-
hermeneutical  ‘as’  ”  in  distinction  from  the  “apophantical  ‘as’  ”  of  the
assertion.

its  ontological  origin 

Between  the  kind  of  interpretation  which  is  still  wholly  wrapped  up  in
concernful  understanding  and  the  extreme  opposite  case  of  a  theoretical
assertion  about  something  present-at-hand,  there  are  many  intermediate
gradations: assertions about the happenings in the environment, accounts of
the ready-to-hand, ‘reports on the Situation’, the recording and fixing of the
‘facts  of  the  case’,  the  description  of  a  state  of  affairs,  the  narration  of
something  that  has  befallen.  We  cannot  trace  back  these  ‘sentences’  to
theoretical statements without essentially perverting their meaning. Like the

With the progress of knowledge about the structure of the λόγος, it was
inevitable that this phenomenon of the apophantical ‘as’ should come into
view  in  some  form  or  other.  The  manner  in  which  it  was  proximally  seen
was  not  accidental,  and  did  not  fail  to  work  itself  out  in  the  subsequent
history of logic.

H. 159

 

When  considered  philosophically,  the  λόγος  itself  is  an  entity,  and,
according to the orientation of ancient ontology, it is something present-at-
hand. Words are proximally present-at-hand; that is to say, we come across
them  just  as  we  come  across  Things;  and  this  holds  for  any  sequence  of

words, as that in which the λόγος expresses itself. In this first search for the
structure  of  the  λόγος  as  thus  present-at-hand,  what  was  found  was  the
Being-present-at-hand-together  of  several  words.  What  establishes  the
unity  of  this  “together”?  As  Plato  knew,  this  unity  lies  in  the  fact  that  the
λόγος is always λόγος  τινός. In  the λόγος  an  entity  is  manifest,  and  with  a
view to this entity, the words are put together in one verbal whole. Aristotle
saw this more radically: every λόγος is both σύνθεσις and διαίρεσις, not just
the  one  (call  it  ‘affirmative  judgment’)  or  the  other  (call  it  ‘negative
judgment’). Rather, every assertion, whether it affirms or denies, whether it
is  true  or  false,  is  σύνθεσις  and  διαίρεσις  equiprimordially.  To  exhibit
anything  is  to  take  it  together  and  take  it  apart.  It  is  true,  of  course,  that
Aristotle  did  not  pursue  the  analytical  question  as  far  as  the  problem  of
which phenomenon within the structure of the λόγος is the one that permits
and  indeed  obliges  us  to  characterize  every  statement  as  synthesis  and
diaeresis.

Along with the formal structures of ‘binding’ and ‘separating’—or, more
precisely, along with the unity of these—we should meet the phenmenon of
the ‘something as something’, and we should meet this as a phenomenon. In
accordance  with  this  structure,  something  is  understood  with  regard  to
something:  it  is  taken  together  with  it,  yet  in  such  a  way  that  this
confrontation which understands will at the same time take apart what has
been taken together, and will do so by Articulating it interpretatively. If the
phenomenon of the ‘as’ remains covered up, and, above all, if its existential

source 
phenomenological  approach  to  the  analysis  of  the  λόγος  collapses  to  a
superficial ‘theory of judgment’, in which judgment becomes the binding or
separating of representations and concepts.

Binding  and  separating  may  be  formalized  still  further  to  a  ‘relating’.
The judgment gets dissolved logistically into a system in which things are
‘co-ordinated’ with one another; it becomes the object of a ‘calculus’; but it
does not become a theme for ontological Interpretation. The possibility and
impossibility  of  getting  an  analytical  understanding  of  σύνθεσις  and
διαίρεσις—of the ‘relation’ in judgment generally—is tightly linked up with
whatever the current status of the ontological problematic and its principles
may be.

into 

its  way 

How  far  this  problematic  has  worked  its  way  into  the  Interpretation  of
the λόγος, and how far on the other hand the concept of ‘judgment’ has (by
the  ontological
a  remarkable  counter-thrust)  worked 
problematic, is shown by the phenomenon of the copula. When we consider
this  ‘bond’,  it  becomes  clear  that  proximally  the  synthesis-structure  is
regarded as self-evident, and that it has also retained the function of serving
as a standard for Interpretation. But if the formal characteristics of ‘relating’
and  ‘binding’  can  contribute  nothing  phenomenally  towards  the  structural
analysis of the λόγος as subject-matter, then in the long run the phenomenon
to which we allude by the term “copula” has nothing to do with a bond or
binding.  The  Interpretation  of  the  ‘is’,  whether  it  be  expressed  in  its  own
right  in  the  language  or  indicated  in  the  verbal  ending,  leads  us  therefore
into  the  context  of  problems  belonging  to  the  existential  analytic,  if
assertion and the understanding of Being are existential possibilities for the
Being  of  Dasein  itself.  When  we  come  to  work  out  the  question  of  Being
(cf.  Part  I,  Division  3),(1)  we  shall  thus  encounter  again  this  peculiar
phenomenon of Being which we meet within the λόγος.
 

1. This Division has never appeared.

By  demonstrating  that  assertion  is  derived  from  interpretation  and
understanding, we have made it plain that the ‘logic’ of the λόγος is rooted
in  the  existential  analytic  of  Dasein;  and  provisionally  this  has  been
sufficient. At the same time, by knowing that the λόγος has been Interpreted
in  a  way  which  is  ontologically  inadequate,  we  have  gained  a  sharper
insight  into  the  fact  that  the  methodological  basis  on  which  ancient
ontology  arose  was  not  a  primordial  one.  The  λόγος  gets  experienced  as
something present-at-hand and Interpreted as such, while at the same time
the entities which it points out have the meaning of presence-at-hand. This
meaning  of  Being  is  left  undifferentiated  and  uncontrasted  with  other
possibilities  of  Being,  so  that  Being  in  the  sense  of  a  formal  Being-
something becomes fused with it simultaneously, and we are unable even to
obtain a clear-cut division between these two realms.

34. Being-there and Discourse. Language

 

 

H. 161

The fundamental existentialia which constitute the Being of the “there”,
the  disclosedness  of  Being-in-the-world,  are 
states-of-mind  and
understanding. In understanding, there lurks the possibility of interpretation
—that is, of appropriating what is understood. In so far as a state-of-mind is
equiprimordial with an act of understanding, it maintains itself in a certain
understanding.  Thus  there  corresponds  to  it  a  certain  capacity  for  getting
interpreted. We have seen that assertion is derived from interpretation, and
is an extreme case of it. In clarifying the third signification of assertion as
communication  (speaking  forth),  we  were  led  to  the  concepts  of  “saying”
and  “speaking”,  to  which  we  had  purposely  given  no  attention  up  to  that
point. The fact that language now becomes our theme for the first time will
indicate that this phenomenon has its roots in the existential constitution of
Dasein’s disclosedness. The existential-ontological  foundation  of  language
is  discourse  or  talk.(1)  This  phenomenon  is  one  of  which  we  have  been
making  constant  use  already  in  our  foregoing  Interpretation  of  state-of-
mind, understanding, interpretation, and assertion; but we have, as it were,
kept it suppressed in our thematic analysis.
 

1. ‘Rede’. As we have pointed out earlier (see our note 3, H. 25 above), we have translated this
word either as ‘discourse’ or ‘talk’, as the context seems to demand, sometimes compromising with
the hendiadys ‘discourse or talk’. But in some contexts ‘discourse’ is too formal while ‘talk’ is too
colloquial;  the  reader  must  remember  that  there  is  no  good  English  equivalent  for  ‘Rede’.  For  a
previous discussion see Section 7 B above (H. 32-34).

Discourse 

is  existentially  equiprimordial  with  state-of-mind  and
understanding. The intelligibility of something has always been articulated,
even before there is any appropriative interpretation of it. Discourse is the
Articulation of intelligibility. Therefore it underlies both interpretation and
assertion.  That  which  can  be  Articulated  in  interpretation,  and  thus  even
more  primordially  in  discourse,  is  what  we  have  called  “meaning”.  That
which  gets  articulated  as  such  in  discursive  Articulation,  we  call  the
“totality-of-significations”  [Bedeutungsganze].  This  can  be  dissolved  or
broken  up  into  significations.  Significations,  as  what  has  been  Articulated
from  that  which  can  be  Articulated,  always  carry  meaning  [...sind…
sinnhaft].  If  discourse,  as  the  Articulation  of  the  intelligibility  of  the

“there”, is a primordial existentiale of disclosedness, and if disclosedness is
primarily constituted  by Being-in-the-world,  then  discourse too  must have
essentially a kind of Being which is specifically worldly. The intelligibility
of Being-in-the-world—an intelligibility which goes with a state-of-mind—
expresses itself  as discourse. The totality-of-significations  of intelligibility
is put into words. To significations, words accrue. But word-Things do not
get supplied with significations.

The way in which discourse gets expressed is languge.(1) Language is a
totality of words—a totality in which discourse has a ‘worldly’ Being of its
own;  and  as  an  entity  within-the-world,  this  totality  thus  becomes
something which we may come across as ready-to-hand. Language can be
broken  up  into  word-Things  which  are  present-at-hand.  Discourse  is
existentially 
it
Articulates according to significations, has, as its kind of Being, Being-in-
the-world—a Being which has been thrown and submitted to the ‘world’.

As  an  existential  state  in  which  Dasein  is  disclosed,  discourse  is
constitutive for Dasein’s existence. Hearing and keeping silent [Schweigen]
are  possibilities  belonging  to  discursive  speech.  In  these  phenomena  the
constitutive function of discourse for the existentiality of existence becomes
entirely plain for the first time. But in the first instance the issue is one of
working out the structure of discourse as such.

H. 162

 

Discoursing  or  talking  is  the  way  in  which  we  articulate  ‘significantly’
the  intelligibility  of  Being-in-the-world.  Being-with  belongs  to  Being-in-
the-world,  which  in  every  case  maintains  itself  in  some  definite  way  of
concernful  Being-with-one-another.  Such  Being-with-one-another 
is
discursive  as  assenting  or  refusing,  as  demanding  or  warning,  as
pronouncing,  consulting,  or  interceding,  as  ‘making  assertions’,  and  as
talking  in  the  way  of  ‘giving  a  talk’.(2)  Talking  is  talk  about  something.
That  which  the  discourse  is  about  [das  Worüber  der  Rede]  does  not
necessarily or even for the most part serve as the theme for an assertion in
which one gives something a definite character. Even a command is given
about something; a wish is about something. And so is intercession. What
the  discourse is  about  is  a structural  item  that it necessarily possesses; for
discourse helps to constitute the disclosedness of Being-in-the-world, and in

its  own  structure  it  is  modelled  upon  this  basic  state  of  Dasein.  What  is
talked about [das Beredete] in talk is always ‘talked to’ [“angeredet”] in a
definite  regard  and  within  certain  limits.  In  any  talk  or  discourse,  there  is
something said-in-the-talk  as  such  [ein  Geredetes  as  solches]—something
said  as  such  [das...  Gesagte  als  solches]  whenever  one  wishes,  asks,  or
expresses  oneself  about  something.  In  this  “something  said”,  discourse
communicates.
 

1. ‘Die Hinausgesprochenheit der Rede ist die Sprache.’
2.  ‘Dieses  ist  redend  als  zu-  und  absagen,  auffordern,  warnen,  als  Aussprache,  Rücksprache,

Fürsprache, ferner als “Aussagen machen” und als reden in der Weise des “Redenhaltens”.’

As  we  have  already  indicated  in  our  analysis  of  assertion,(1)  the
phenomenon  of  communication  must  be  understood  in  a  sense  which  is
ontologically  broad.  ‘Communication’  in  which  one  makes  assertions—
giving  information,  for  instance—is  a  special  case  of  that  communication
which  is  grasped  in  principle  existentially.  In  this  more  general  kind  of
communication, the Articulation of Being with one another understandingly
is  constituted.  Through  it  a  co-state-of-mind  [Mitbefindlichkeit]  gets
‘shared’,  and  so  does  the  understanding  of  Being-with.  Communication  is
never anything like a conveying of experiences, such as opinions or wishes,
from the interior of one subject into the interior of another. Dasein-with is
already  essentially  manifest  in  a  co-state-of-mind  and  a  co-understanding.
In  discourse  Being-with  becomes  ‘explicitly’  shared;  that  is  to  say,  it  is
already, but it is unshared as something that has not been taken hold of and
appropriated.(2)

Whenever something is communicated in what is said-in-the-talk, all talk
about  anything  has  at  the  same  time  the  character  of  expressing  itself
[Sichaussprechens]. In  talking,  Dasein  expresses  itself  [spricht  sich...  aus]
not  because  it  has,  in  the  first  instance,  been  encapsulated  as  something
‘internal’  over  against  something  outside,  but  because  as  Being-in-the-
world  it  is  already  ‘outside’  when  it  understands.  What  is  expressed  is
precisely this Being-outside—that is to say, the way in which one currently

has  a  state-of-mind  (mood),  which  we  have  shown  to  pertain  to  the  full
disclosedness of Being-in. Being-in and its state-of-mind are made known
in discourse and indicated in language by intonation, modulation, the tempo
of talk, ‘the way of speaking’. In ‘poetical’ discourse, the communication of
the  existential  possibilities  of  one’s  state-of-mind  can  become  an  aim  in
itself, and this amounts to a disclosing of existence.

H. 163

 

In  discourse  the  intelligibility  of  Being-in-the-world  (an  intelligibility
which goes with a state-of-mind) is articulated according to significations;
and  discourse  is  this  articulation.  The  items  constitutive  for  discourse  are:
what the discourse is about (what is talked about); what is said-in-the-talk,
as  such;  the  communication;  and  the  making-known.  These  are  not
properties which can just be raked up empirically from language. They are
existential characteristics rooted in the state of Dasein’s Being, and it is they
that first make anything like language ontologically possible. In the factical
linguistic form of any definite case of discourse, some of these items may
be lacking, or may remain unnoticed. The fact that they often do not receive
‘verbal’ expression, is merely an index of some definite kind of discourse
which, in so far as it is discourse, must in every case lie within the totality
of the structures we have mentioned.

Attempts  to  grasp  the  ‘essence  of  language’  have  always  taken  their
orientation  from  one  or  another  of  these  items;  and  the  clues  to  their
conceptions of language have been the ideas of ‘expression’, of ‘symbolic
form’,  of  communication  as  ‘assertion’,(1)  of  the  ‘making-known’  of
experiences, of the ‘patterning’ of life. Even if one were to put these various
fragmentary  definitions  together  in  syncretistic  fashion,  nothing  would  be
achieved in the way of a fully adequate definition of “language”. We would
still  have  to  do  what  is  decisive  here—to  work  out  in  advance  the
ontologico-existential whole of the structure of discourse on the basis of the
analytic of Dasein.

We can make clear the connection of discourse with understanding and
intelligibility  by  considering  an  existential  possibility  which  belongs  to
talking  itself—hearing.  If  we  have not  heard  ‘aright’,  it is  not  by accident
that we say we have not ‘understood’. Hearing is constitutive for discourse.
And  just  as  linguistic  utterance  is  based  on  discourse,  so  is  acoustic

perception on hearing. Listening to... is Dasein’s existential way of Being-
open as Being-with for Others. Indeed, hearing constitutes the primary and
authentic  way  in  which  Dasein  is  open  for  its  ownmost  potentiality-for-
Being—as  in  hearing  the  voice  of  the  friend  whom  every  Dasein  carries
with it. Dasein hears, because it understands. As a Being-in-the-world with
Others, a Being which understands, Dasein is ‘in thrall’ to Dasein-with and
to itself; and in this thraldom it “belongs” to these.(2) Being-with develops
in  listening  to  one  another  [Aufeinander-hören],  which  can  be  done  in
several  possible  ways:  following,(3)  going  along  with,  and  the  privative
modes of not-hearing, resisting, defying, and turning away.
 

1. ‘…der Mitteilung als “Aussage”...’ The quotation marks around ‘Aussage’ appear only in the

newer editions.

2.  ‘Als  verstehendes  In-der-Welt-sein  mit  den  Anderen  ist  es  dem  Mitdasein  und  ihm  selbst
“hörig” und in dieser Hörigkeit zugehörig.’ In this sentence Heidegger uses some cognates of ‘hören’
(‘hearing’) whose interrelations disappear in our version.

3. ‘...des Folgens...’ In the earlier editions there are quotation marks around ‘Folgens’.

It  is  on  the  basis  of  this  potentiality  for  hearing,  which  is  existentially
primary,  that  anything  like  hearkening  [Horchen]  becomes  possible.
Hearkening is phenomenally still more primordial than what is defined ‘in
the first instance’ as “hearing” in psychology—the sensing of tones and the
perception of sounds. Hearkening too has the kind of Being of the hearing
which  understands.  What  we  ‘first’  hear  is  never  noises  or  complexes  of
sounds, but the creaking waggon, the motor-cycle. We hear the column on
the march, the north wind, the woodpecker tapping, the fire crackling.

H. 164

 

It  requires  a  very  artificial  and  complicated  frame  of  mind  to  ‘hear’  a
‘pure  noise’.  The  fact  that  motor-cycles  and  waggons  are  what  we
proximally  hear  is  the  phenomenal  evidence  that  in  every  case  Dasein,  as
Being-in-the-world, already dwells alongside what is ready-to-hand within-
the-world; it certainly does not dwell proximally alongside ‘sensations’; nor
would  it  first  have  to  give  shape  to  the  swirl  of  sensations  to  provide  the
springboard  from  which  the  subject  leaps  off  and  finally  arrives  at  a
‘world’. Dasein, as essentially understanding, is proximally alongside what
is understood.

Likewise,  when  we  are  explicitly  hearing  the  discourse  of  another,  we
proximally  understand  what  is  said,  or—to  put  it  more  exactly—we  are
already  with  him,  in  advance,  alongside  the  entity  which  the  discourse  is
about. On the other hand, what we proximally hear is not what is expressed
in the utterance. Even in cases where the speech is indistinct or in a foreign
language,  what  we  proximally  hear  is  unintelligible  words,  and  not  a
multiplicity of tone-data.(1)

Admittedly,  when  what  the  discourse  is  about  is  heard  ‘naturally’,  we
can  at  the  same  time  hear  the  ‘diction’,  the  way  in  which  it  is  said  [die
Weise  des  Gesagtseins],  but  only  if  there  is  some  co-understanding
beforehand  of  what  is  said-in-the-talk;  for  only  so  is  there  a  possibility  of
estimating  whether  the  way  in  which  it  is  said  is  appropriate  to  what  the
discourse is about thematically.

In the same way, any answering counter-discourse arises proximally and
directly  from  understanding  what  the  discourse  is  about,  which  is  already
‘shared’ in Being-with.

Only  where  talking  and  hearing  are  existentially  possible,  can  anyone
hearken. The person who ‘cannot hear’ and ‘must feel’(2) may perhaps be
one  who  is  able  to  hearken  very  well,  and  precisely  because  of  this.  Just
hearing something “all around” [Das Nur-herum-hören] is a privation of the
hearing  which  understands.  Both  talking  and  hearing  are  based  upon
understanding.  And  understanding  arises  neither  through  talking  at  length
[vieles Reden] nor through busily hearing something “all around”. Only he
who already understands can listen [zuhören].
 

1.  Here  we  follow  the  reading  of  the  newer  editions:  ‘...nicht  eine  Mannigfaltigkeit  von

Tondaten.’ The older editions have ‘reine’ instead of ‘eine’.

2. The author is here alluding to the German proverb, ‘Wer nicht hören kann, muss fühlen.’ (I.e.

he who cannot heed, must suffer.)

H. 165

 

Keeping silent is another essential possibility of discourse, and it has the
same  existential  foundation.  In  talking  with  one  another,  the  person  who
keeps  silent  can  ‘make  one  understand’  (that  is,  he  can  develop  an
understanding), and he can do so more authentically than the person who is
never  short  of  words.  Speaking  at  length  [Viel-sprechen]  about  something
does  not  offer  the  slightest  guarantee  that  thereby  understanding  is

advanced.  On  the  contrary,  talking  extensively  about  something,  covers  it
up and brings what is understood to a sham clarity—the unintelligibility of
the trivial. But to keep silent does not mean to be dumb. On the contrary, if
a  man  is  dumb,  he  still  has  a  tendency  to  ‘speak’.  Such  a  person  has  not
proved that he can keep silence; indeed, he entirely lacks the possibility of
proving anything of the sort. And the person who is accustomed by Nature
to speak little is no better able to show that he is keeping silent or that he is
the sort of person who can do so. He who never says anything cannot keep
silent at any given moment. Keeping silent authentically is possible only in
genuine discoursing. To be able to keep silent, Dasein must have something
to  say—that  is,  it  must  have  at  its  disposal  an  authentic  and  rich
disclosedness  of  itself.  In  that  case  one’s  reticence  [Verschwiegenheit]
makes something manifest, and does away with ‘idle talk’ [“Gerede”]. As a
mode of discoursing, reticence Articulates the intelligibility of Dasein in so
primordial a manner that it gives rise to a Potentiality-for-hearing which is
genuine, and to a Being-with-one-another which is transparent.

Because discourse is constitutive for the Being of the “there” (that is, for
states-of-mind  and  understanding),  while  “Dasein”  means  Being-in-the-
world,  Dasein  as  discursive  Being-in,  has  already  expressed  itself.  Dasein
has  language.  Among  the  Greeks,  their  everyday  existing  was  largely
diverted into talking with one another, but at the same time they ‘had eyes’
to  see.  Is  it  an  accident  that  in  both  their  pre-philosophical  and  their
philosophical ways of interpreting Dasein, they defined the essence of man
as ζῷον λόγον ἔχον? The later way of interpreting this definition of man in
the  sense  of  the animal  rationale, ‘something  living  which  has  reason’,  is
not indeed ‘false’, but it covers up the phenomenal basis for this definition
of  “Dasein”.  Man  shows  himself  as  the  entity  which  talks.  This  does  not
signify that the possibility of vocal utterance is peculiar to him, but rather
that he is the entity which is such as to discover the world and Dasein itself.
The Greeks had no word for “language”; they understood this phenomenon
‘in  the  first  instance’  as  discourse.  But  because  the  λόγος  came  into  their
philosophical  ken  primarily  as  assertion, this was  the  kind  of  logos which
they took as their clue for working out the basic structures of the forms of
discourse  and  its  components.  Grammar  sought  its  foundations  in  the
‘logic’  of  this  logos.  But  this  logic  was  based  upon  the  ontology  of  the
present-at-hand.  The  basic  stock  of  ‘categories  of  signification’,  which
passed over into the subsequent science of language, and which in principle

is  still  accepted  as  the  standard  today,  is  oriented  towards  discourse  as
assertion.  But  if  on  the  contrary  we  take  this  phenomenon  to  have  in
principle  the  primordiality  and  breadth  of  an  existentiale,  then  there
emerges  the  necessity  of  re-establishing  the  science  of  language  on
foundations which are ontologically more primordial. The task of liberating
grammar  from  logic  requires  beforehand  a  positive  understanding  of  the
basic a priori structure of discourse in general as an existentiale.

H. 166

 

It  is  not  a  task  that  can  be  carried  through  later  on  by  improving  and
rounding  out  what  has  been  handed  down.  Bearing  this  in  mind,  we  must
inquire  into  the  basic  forms  in  which  it  is  possible  to  articulate  anything
understandable,  and  to  do  so  in  accordance  with  significations;  and  this
articulation  must  not  be  confined  to  entities  within-the-world  which  we
cognize  by  considering  them  theoretically,  and  which  we  express  in
sentences. A doctrine of signification will not emerge automatically even if
we  make  a  comprehensive  comparison  of  as  many  languages  as  possible,
and  those  which  are  most  exotic.  To  accept,  let  us  say,  the  philosophical
horizon  within  which  W.  von  Humboldt  made  language  a  problem,  would
be no less inadequate. The doctrine of signification is rooted in the ontology
of  Dasein.  Whether  it  prospers  or  decays  depends  on  the  fate  of  this
ontology.(x)
 

x.  On  the  doctrine  of  signification,  cf.  Edmund  Husserl,  Logische  Untersuchungen,  vol.  II,
Investigations  I,  IV-VI.  See  further  the  more  radical  version  of  the  problematic  in  his  Ideen  I,
Sections 123 ff., pp. 255 ff.
 

In the last resort, philosophical research must resolve to ask what kind of
Being  goes  with  language  in  general.  Is  it  a  kind  of  equipment  ready-to-
hand within-the-world, or has it Dasein’s kind of Being, or is it neither of
these? What kind of Being does language have, if there can be such a thing
as a ‘dead’ language? What do the “rise” and “decline” of a language mean
ontologically?  We  possess  a  science  of  language,  and  the  Being  of  the
entities  which  it  has  for  its  theme  is  obscure.  Even  the  horizon  for  any
investigative question about it is veiled. Is it an accident that proximally and
for  the  most  part  significations  are  ‘worldly’,  sketched  out  beforehand  by
the  significance  of  the  world,  that  they  are  indeed  often  predominantly

‘spatial’? Or does this ‘fact’ have existential-ontological necessity? And if it
is  necessary,  why  should  it  be  so?  Philosophical  research  will  have  to
dispense  with  the  ‘philosophy  of  language’  if  it  is  to  inquire  into  ‘the
‘things  themselves’  and  attain  the  status  of  a  problematic  which  has  been
cleared up conceptually.

Our Interpretation of language has been designed merely to point out the
ontological  ‘locus’  of  this  phenomenon  in  Dasein’s  state  of  Being,  and
especially to prepare the way for the following analysis, in which, taking as
our clue a fundamental kind of Being belonging to discourse, in connection
with  other  phenomena,  we  shall  try  to  bring  Dasein’s  everydayness  into
view in a manner which is ontologically more primordial.

B. The Everyday Being of the “There”, and the Falling of Dasein

 

 

H. 167

In going back to the existential structures of the disclosedness of Being-
in-the-world,  our  Interpretation  has,  in  a  way,  lost  sight  of  Dasein’s
everydayness. In our analysis, we must now regain this phenomenal horizon
which was our thematical starting-point. The question now arises: what are
the existential characteristics of the disclosedness of Being-in-the-world, so
far as the latter, as something which is everyday, maintains itself in the kind
of  Being  of  the  “they”?  Does  the  “they”  have  a  state-of-mind  which  is
specific  to  it,  a  special  way  of  understanding,  talking,  and  interpreting?  It
becomes all the more urgent to answer these questions when we remember
that proximally and for the most part Dasein is absorbed in the “they” and is
mastered  by  it.  Is  not  Dasein,  as  thrown  Being-in-the-world,  thrown
proximally  right  into  the  publicness  of  the  “they”?  And  what  does  this
publicness mean, other than the specific disclosedness of the “they”?

If  understanding  must  be  conceived  primarily  as  Dasein’s  potentiality-
for-Being,  then  it  is  from  an  analysis  of  the  way  of  understanding  and
interpreting  which  belongs  to  the  “they”  that  we  must  gather  which
possibilities of its Being have been disclosed and appropriated by Dasein as
“they”. In that case, however, these possibilities themselves make manifest
an  essential  tendency  of  Being—one  which  belongs  to  everydayness.  And
finally, when this tendency has been explicated in an ontologically adequate

manner, it must unveil a primordial kind of Being of Dasein, in such a way,
indeed, that from this kind of Being(1) the phenomenon of thrownness, to
which  we  have  called  attention,  can  be  exhibited  in  its  existential
concreteness.

In  the  first  instance  what  is  required  is  that  the  disclosedness  of  the
“they”—that  is,  the  everyday  kind  of  Being  of  discourse,  sight,  and
interpretation—should  be  made  visible  in  certain  definite  phenomena.  In
relation to these phenomena, it may not be superfluous to remark that our
own Interpretation is purely ontological in its aims, and is far removed from
any  moralizing  critique  of  everyday  Dasein,  and  from  the  aspirations  of  a
‘philosophy of culture’.

35. Idle Talk

H. 168

 

 

The  expression  ‘idle  talk’  [“Gerede”]  is  not  to  be  used  here  in  a
‘disparaging’(1)  signification.  Terminologically,  it  signifies  a  positive
phenomenon  which  constitutes  the  kind  of  Being  of  everyday  Dasein’s
understanding and interpreting. For the most part, discourse is expressed by
being spoken out, and has always been so expressed; it is language.(2) But
in  that  case  understanding  and  interpretation  already  lie  in  what  has  thus
been expressed. In language, as a way things have been expressed or spoken
out [Ausgesprochenheit],there is hidden a way in which the understanding
of Dasein has been interpreted. This way of interpreting it is no more just
present-at-hand  than  language  is;  on  the  contrary,  its  Being  is  itself  of  the
character  of  Dasein.  Proximally,  and  with  certain  limits,  Dasein  is
constantly  delivered  over  to  this  interpretedness,  which  controls  and
distributes  the  possibilities  of  average  understanding  and  of  the  state-of-
mind belonging to it. The way things have been expressed or spoken out is
such  that  in  the  totality  of  contexts  of  signification  into  which  it  has  been
articulated,  it  preserves  an  understanding  of  the  disclosed  world  and
therewith, equiprimordially, an understanding of the Dasein-with of Others
and of one’s own Being-in. The understanding which has thus already been

“deposited” in the way things have been expressed, pertains just as much to
any traditional discoveredness of entities which may have been reached, as
it does to one’s current understanding of Being and to whatever possibilities
and  horizons  for  fresh  interpretation  and  conceptual  Articulation  may  be
available.  But  now  we  must  go  beyond  a  bare  allusion  to  the  Fact  of  this
interpretedness  of  Dasein,  and  must  inquire  about  the  existential  kind  of
Being  of  that  discourse  which  is  expressed  and  which  expresses  itself.  If
this  cannot  be  conceived  as  something  present-at-hand,  what  is  its  Being,
and  what  does  this  tell  us  in  principle  about  Dasein’s  everyday  kind  of
Being?
 

1.  These  quotation  marks  are  supplied  only  in  the  older  editions.  (It  is  not  easy  to  translate
‘Gerede’ in a way which does not carry disparaging connotations. Fortunately Heidegger makes his
meaning quite clear.)

2. ‘Die Rede spricht sich zumeist aus und hat sich schon immer ausgesprochen. Sie ist Sprache.’
As  we  have  pointed  out  earlier  (see  our  note  1,  H.  149  above),  it  is  often  sufficient  to  translate
‘aussprechen’  as  ‘express’.  In  the  present  passage,  however,  the  connotation  of  ‘speaking  out’  or
‘uttering’  seems  especially  important;  we  shall  occasionally  make  it  explicit  in  our  translation  by
hendiadys or other devices.

Discourse  which  expresses  itself  is  communication.  Its  tendency  of
Being  is  aimed  at  bringing  the  hearer  to  participate  in  disclosed  Being
towards what is talked about in the discourse.

In the language which is spoken when one expresses oneself, there lies
an  average  intelligibility;  and  in  accordance  with  this  intelligibility  the
discourse  which  is  communicated  can  be  understood  to  a  considerable
extent, even if the hearer does not bring himself into such a kind of Being
towards what the discourse is about as to have a primordial understanding
of it. We do not so much understand the entities which are talked about; we
already are listening only to what is said-in-the-talk as such. What is said-
in-the-talk  gets  understood;  but  what  the  talk  is  about  is  understood  only
approximately and superficially. We have the same thing in view, because it
is in the same averageness that we have a common understanding of what is
said.

Hearing and understanding have attached themselves beforehand to what
is  said-in-the-talk  as  such.  The  primary  relationship-of-Being  towards  the
entity talked about is not ‘imparted’ by communication;(1) but Being-with-
one-another  takes  place  in  talking  with  one  another  and  in  concern  with
what is said-in-the-talk. To this Being-with-one-another, the fact that talking

for 

[Ausspruch]—all 

these  now  stand  surety 

is going on is a matter of consequence.(2) The Being-said, the dictum, the
pronouncement 
the
genuineness of the discourse and of the understanding which belongs to it,
and  for  its  appropriateness  to  the  facts.  And  because  this  discoursing  has
lost  its  primary  relationship-of-Being  towards  the  entity  talked  about,  or
else  has  never  achieved  such  a  relationship,  it  does  not  communicate  in
such a way as to let this entity be appropriated in a primordial manner, but
communicates  rather  by  following  the  route  of  gossiping and  passing  the
word along.(3) What is said-in-the-talk as such, spreads in wider circles and
takes on an authoritative character. Things are so because one says so. Idle
talk  is  constituted  by  just  such  gossiping  and  passing  the  word  along—a
process by which its initial lack of grounds to stand on [Bodenständigkeit]
becomes  aggravated  to  complete  groundlessness  [Bodenlosigkeit].  And
indeed  this  idle  talk  is  not  confined  to  vocal  gossip,  but  even  spreads  to
what we write, where it takes the form of ‘scribbling’ [das “Geschreibe”].
In  this  latter  case  the  gossip  is  not  based  so  much  upon  hearsay.  It  feeds
upon superficial reading [dem Angelesenen]. The average understanding of
the  reader  will  never  be  able  to  decide  what  has  been  drawn  from
primordial  sources  with  a  struggle  and  how  much  is  just  gossip.  The
average  understanding,  moreover,  will  not  want  any  such  distinction,  and
does not need it, because, of course, it understands everything.
 

1. ‘Die Mitteilung “teilt” nicht den primären Seinsbezug zum beredeten Seienden...’
2.  ‘Ihm  liegt  daran,  dass  geredet  wird.’  We  have  interpreted  ‘Ihm’  as  referring  to  ‘das

Miteinandersein’, but other interpretations are grammatically possible.

3. ‘...sondern auf dem Wege des Weiter- und Nachredens.’

H. 169

 

The  groundlessness  of  idle  talk  is  no  obstacle  to  its  becoming  public;
instead  it  encourages  this.  Idle  talk  is  the  possibility  of  understanding
everything  without  previously  making  the  thing  one’s  own.  If  this  were
done, idle talk would founder; and it already guards against such a danger.
Idle  talk  is  something  which  anyone  can  rake  up;  it  not  only  releases  one
from the task of genuinely understanding, but develops an undifferentiated
kind of intelligibility, for which nothing is closed off any longer.

Discourse, which belongs to the essential state of Dasein’s Being and has
a  share  in  constituting  Dasein’s  disclosedness,  has  the  possibility  of

becoming  idle  talk.  And  when  it  does  so,  it  serves  not  so  much  to  keep
Being-in-the-world open for us in an articulated understanding, as rather to
close it off, and cover up the entities within-the-world. To do this, one need
not aim to deceive. Idle talk does not have the kind of Being which belongs
to  consciously  passing  off  something  as  something  else.  The  fact  that
something has been said groundlessly, and then gets passed along in further
retelling, amounts to perverting the act of disclosing [Erschliessen] into an
act  of  closing  off  [Verschliessen].  For  what  is  said  is  always  understood
proximally as ‘saying’ something—that is, an uncovering something. Thus,
by its very nature, idle talk is a closing-off, since to go back to the ground
of what is talked about is something which it leaves undone.

This closing-off is aggravated afresh by the fact that an understanding of
what is talked about is supposedly reached in idle talk. Because of this, idle
talk discourages any new inquiry and any disputation, and in a peculiar way
suppresses them and holds them back.

H. 170

 

This way in which things have been interpreted in idle talk has already
established  itself  in  Dasein.  There  are  many  things  with  which  we  first
become  acquainted  in  this  way,  and  there  is  not  a  little  which  never  gets
beyond such an average understanding. This everyday way in which things
have  been  interpreted  is  one  into  which  Dasein  has  grown  in  the  first
instance, with never a possibility of extrication. In it, out of it, and against
it,  all  genuine  understanding,  interpreting,  and  communicating,  all  re-
discovering and appropriating anew, are performed. In no case is a Dasein,
untouched  and  unseduced  by  this  way  in  which  things  have  been
interpreted, set before the open country of a ‘world-in-itself’ so that it just
beholds  what  it  encounters.  The  dominance  of  the  public  way  in  which
things  have  been  interpreted  has  already  been  decisive  even  for  the
possibilities of having a mood—that is, for the basic way in which Dasein
lets the world “matter” to it.(1) The “they” prescribes one’s state-of-mind,
and determines what and how one ‘sees’.
 

1. ‘…über die Möglichkeiten des Gestimmtseins entschieden, das heisst über die Grundart, in der

sich das Dasein von der Welt angehen lässt.’ The second ‘über’ is found only in the later editions.

Idle talk, which closes things off in the way we have designated, is the
kind  of  Being  which  belongs  to  Dasein’s  understanding  when  that
understanding has been uprooted. But idle talk does not occur as a condition
which  is  present-at-hand  in  something  present-at-hand:  idle  talk  has  been
uprooted  existentially,  and  this  uprooting  is  constant.  Ontologically  this
means that when Dasein maintains itself in idle talk, it is—as Being-in-the-
world—cut off from its primary and primordially genuine relationships-of-
Being towards the world, towards Dasein-with, and towards its very Being-
in.  Such  a  Dasein  keeps  floating  unattached  [in  einer  Schwebe];  yet  in  so
doing, it is always alongside the world, with Others, and towards itself. To
be  uprooted  in  this  manner  is  a  possibility-of-Being  only  for  an  entity
whose  disclosedness  is  constituted  by  discourse  as  characterized  by
understanding  and  states-of-mind—that  is  to  say,  for  an  entity  whose
disclosedness, in  such an ontologically constitutive  state, is  its  “there”,  its
‘in-the-world’.  Far  from  amounting  to  a  “not-Being”  of  Dasein,  this
uprooting is rather Dasein’s most everyday and most stubborn ‘Reality’.

Yet  the  obviousness  and  self-assurance  of  the  average  ways  in  which
things have been interpreted, are such that while the particular Dasein drifts
along 
the
uncanniness  of  this  floating  remains  hidden  from  it  under  their  protecting
shelter.

it  floats, 

36. Curiosity

 

In our analysis of understanding and of the disclosedness of the “there”
in  general,  we  have  alluded  to  the  lumen  naturale,  and  designated  the
disclosedness of Being-in as Dasein’s “clearing”, in which it first becomes
possible  to  have  something  like  sight.(1)  Our  conception  of  “sight”  has
been  gained  by  looking  at  the  basic  kind  of  disclosure  which  is
characteristic  of  Dasein—namely,  understanding,  in  the  sense  of  the
genuine appropriation of those entities towards which Dasein can comport
itself in accordance with its essential possibilities of Being.

the 

this 

tendency  by 

The  basic  state  of  sight  shows  itself  in  a  peculiar  tendency-of-Being
which  belongs  to  everydayness—the  tendency  towards  ‘seeing’.  We
term  “curiosity”  [Neugier],  which
designate 
characteristically  is  not  confined  to  seeing,  but  expresses  the  tendency
towards  a  peculiar  way  of  letting  the  world  be  encountered  by  us  in
perception.  Our  aim  in  Interpreting  this  phenomenon  is  in  principle  one
which  is  existential-ontological.  We  do  not  restrict  ourselves  to  an
orientation  towards  cognition.  Even  at  an  early  date  (and  in  Greek
philosophy  this  was  no  accident)  cognition  was  conceived  in  terms  of  the
‘desire  to  see’.(1)  The  treatise  which  stands  first  in  the  collection  of
Aristotle’s treatises on ontology begins with the sentence: πάντες ἄνθρωποι
τοῦ  εἰδέναι  ὀρέγονται  φύσει.(xi)  The  care  for  seeing  is  essential  to  man’s
Being.(2) This remark introduces an investigation in which Aristotle seeks
to uncover the source of all learned exploration of entities and their Being,
by  deriving  it  from  that  species  of  Dasein’s  Being  which  we  have  just
mentioned. This Greek Interpretation of the existential genesis of science is
not  accidental.  It  brings  to  explicit  understanding  what  has  already  been
sketched out beforehand in the principle of Parmenides: τὸ γὰρ  αὐτὸ  νοεῖν
ἐστίν τε καὶ εἶναι.(3) Being is that which shows itself in the pure perception
which  belongs  to  beholding,  and  only  by  such  seeing  does  Being  get
discovered. Primordial and genuine truth lies in pure beholding. This thesis
has  remained  the  foundation  of  western  philosophy  ever  since.  The
Hegelian dialectic found in it its motivating conception, and is possible only
on the basis of it.
 

xi. Aristotle, Metaphysica A 1, 980 a 21.

1. ‘…nicht in der verengten Orientierung am Erkennen, das schon früh und in der griechischen
Philosophie  nicht  zufällig aus der “Lust zu  sehen” begriffen wird.’ The  earlier  editions  have  ‘...am
Erkennen, als welches schon früh…’

2.  While  the  sentence  from  Aristotle  is  usually  translated,  ‘All  men  by  nature  desire  to  know’,
Heidegger  takes  εἰδέναι  in  its  root  meaning,  ‘to  see’,  and  connects  ὀρέγονται  (literally:  ‘reach  out
for’) with ‘Sorge’ (‘care’).

3.  This  sentence  has  been  variously  interpreted.  The  most  usual  version  is:  ‘For  thinking  and
being are the same.’ Heidegger, however, goes back to the original meaning of νοεῖν as ‘to perceive
with the eyes’.

The  remarkable  priority  of  ‘seeing’  was  noticed  particularly  by
Augustine, in connection with his Interpretation of concupiscentia.(xii) “Ad

oculos  enim  videre  proprie  pertinet.”  (“Seeing  belongs  properly  to  the
eyes.”)  “Utimur  autem  hoc  verbo  etiam  in  ceteris  sensibus  cum  eos  ad
cognoscendum intendimus.” (“But  we  even  use  this  word  ‘seeing’  for  the
other  senses  when  we  devote  them  to  cognizing.”)  “Neque  enim  dicimus:
audi  quid  rutilet;  aut,  olfac  quam  niteat;  aut,  gusta  quam  splendeat;  aut,
palpa quam fulgeat: videri enim dicuntur haec omnia.” (“For we do not say
‘Hear how it glows’, or ‘Smell how it glistens’, or ‘Taste how it shines’, or
‘Feel  how  it  flashes’;  but  we  say  of  each,  ‘See’;  we  say  that  all  this  is
seen.”) “Dicimus autem non solum, vide quid luceat, quod soli oculi sentire
possunt.” (“We  not  only  say,  ‘See  how  that  shines’,  when  the  eyes  alone
can  perceive  it;”)  “sed  etiam,  vide  quid  sonet;  vide  quid  oleat;  vide  quid
sapiat;  vide  quam  durum  sit;”  (“but  we  even  say,  ‘See  how  that  sounds’,
‘See  how  that  is  scented’,  ‘See  how  that  tastes’,  ‘See  how  hard  that  is’.”)
“Ideoque  generalis  experientia  sensuum  concupiscentia  sicut  dictum  est
oculorum  vocatur,  quia  videndi  officium  in  quo  primatum  oculi  tenent,
etiam  ceteri  sensus  sibi  de  similitudine  usurpant,  cum  aliquid  cognitionis
explorant.”  (“Therefore  the  experience  of  the  senses  in  general  is
designated  as  the  ‘lust  of  the  eyes’;  for  when  the  issue  is  one  of  knowing
something,  the  other  senses,  by  a  certain  resemblance,  take  to  themselves
the function of seeing—a function in which the eyes have priority.”)
 

xii. Augustine, Confessiones, X, 35.

H. 172

 

What is to be said about this tendency just to perceive? Which existential

state of Dasein will become intelligible in the phenomenon of curiosity?

Being-in-the-world is proximally absorbed in the world of concern. This
concern  is  guided  by  circumspection,  which  discovers  the  ready-to-hand
and  preserves  it  as  thus  discovered.  Whenever  we  have  something  to
contribute  or  perform,  circumspection  gives  us  the  route  for  proceeding
with it, the means of carrying it out, the right opportunity, the appropriate
moment.  Concern  may  come  to  rest  in  the  sense  of  one’s  interrupting  the
performance and taking a rest, or it can do so by getting it finished. In rest,
concern does not disappear; circumspection, however, becomes free and is
no longer bound to the world of work. When we take a rest, care subsides
into  circumspection  which  has  been  set  free.  In  the  world  of  work,

circumspective  discovering  has  de-severing  as  the  character  of  its  Being.
When circumspection has been set free, there is no longer anything ready-
to-hand  which  we  must  concern  ourselves  with  bringing  close.  But,  as
essentially  de-severant,  this  circumspection  provides  itself  with  new
possibilities  of  de-severing.  This  means  that  it  tends  away  from  what  is
most  closely  ready-to-hand,  and  into  a  far  and  alien  world.  Care  becomes
concern with the possibilities of seeing the ‘world’ merely as it looks while
one tarries and takes a rest. Dasein seeks what is far away simply in order to
bring it close to itself in the way it looks. Dasein lets itself be carried along
[mitnehmen]  solely  by  the  looks  of  the  world;  in  this  kind  of  Being,  it
concerns itself with becoming rid of itself as Being-in-the-world and rid of
its Being alongside that which, in the closest everyday manner, is ready-to-
hand.

When curiosity has become free, however, it concerns itself with seeing,
not  in  order  to  understand  what  is  seen  (that  is,  to  come  into  a  Being
towards  it)  but  just  in  order  to  see.  It  seeks  novelty  only  in  order  to  leap
from  it  anew  to  another  novelty.  In  this  kind  of  seeing,  that  which  is  an
issue for care does not lie in grasping something and being knowingly in the
truth;  it  lies  rather  in  its  possibilities  of  abandoning  itself  to  the  world.
Therefore  curiosity  is  characterized  by  a  specific  way  of  not  tarrying
alongside  what  is  closest.  Consequently  it  does  not  seek  the  leisure  of
tarrying  observantly,  but  rather  seeks  restlessness  and  the  excitement  of
continual  novelty  and  changing  encounters.  In  not  tarrying,  curiosity  is
concerned with the constant possibility of distraction. Curiosity has nothing
to  do  with  observing  entities  and  marvelling  at  them—θαυμάζειν.  To  be
amazed  to  the  point  of  not  understanding  is  something  in  which  it  has  no
interest. Rather it concerns itself with a kind of knowing, but just in order to
have  known.  Both  this  not  tarrying  in  the  environment  with  which  one
concerns oneself, and this distraction by  new  possibilities, are  constitutive
items  for  curiosity;  and  upon  these  is  founded  the  third  essential
characteristic  of  this  phenomenon,  which  we  call  the  character  of  “never
dwelling  anywhere”  [Aufenthaltslosigkeit].  Curiosity  is  everywhere  and
nowhere. This mode of Being-in-the-world reveals a new kind of Being of
everyday Dasein—a kind in which Dasein is constantly uprooting itself.

H. 173

 

Idle  talk  controls  even  the  ways  in  which  one  may  be  curious.  It  says
what  one  “must”  have  read  and  seen.  In  being  everywhere  and  nowhere,
curiosity is delivered over to idle talk. These two everyday modes of Being
for  discourse  and  sight  are  not  just  present-at-hand  side  by  side  in  their
tendency to uproot, but either of these ways-to-be drags the other one with
it. Curiosity, for which nothing is closed off, and idle talk, for which there is
nothing  that  is  not  understood,  provide  themselves  (that  is,  the  Dasein
which is in this manner [dem so seienden Dasein]) with the guarantee of a
‘life’  which,  supposedly,  is  genuinely  ‘lively’.  But  with  this  supposition  a
third  phenomenon  now  shows  itself,  by  which  the  disclosedness  of
everyday Dasein is characterized.

37. Ambiguity

 

When, in our everyday Being-with-one-another, we encounter the sort of
thing  which  is  accessible  to  everyone,  and  about  which  anyone  can  say
anything,  it  soon  becomes  impossible  to  decide  what  is  disclosed  in  a
genuine  understanding,  and  what  is  not.  This  ambiguity  [Zweideutigkeit]
extends not only to the world, but just as much to Being-with-one-another
as such, and even to Dasein’s Being towards itself.

Everything  looks  as  if  it  were  genuinely  understood,  genuinely  taken
hold  of,  genuinely  spoken,  though  at  bottom  it  is  not;  or  else  it  does  not
look so, and yet at bottom it is. Ambiguity not only affects the way we avail
ourselves  of  what  is  accessible  for  use  and  enjoyment,  and  the  way  we
manage it; ambiguity has already established itself in the understanding as a
potentiality-for-Being,  and  in  the  way  Dasein  projects  itself  and  presents
itself  with  possibilities.(1)  Everyone  is  acquainted  with  what  is  up  for
discussion and what occurs,(2) and everyone discusses it; but everyone also
knows  already  how  to  talk  about  what  has  to  happen  first—about  what  is
not yet up for discussion but ‘really’ must be done.
 

1. ‘…sondern sie hat sich schon im Verstehen als Seinkönnen in der Art des Entwurfs und der

Vorgabe von Möglichkeiten des Daseins festgesetzt.’

2 ‘…was vorliegt und vorkommt...’

Already everyone has surmised and scented out in advance what Others
have  also  surmised  and  scented  out.  This  Being-on-the  scent  is  of  course

based upon hearsay, for if anyone is genuinely ‘on the scent’ of anything, he
does  not  speak  about  it;  and  this  is  the  most  entangling  way  in  which
ambiguity presents Dasein’s possibilities so that they will already be stifled
in their power.(1)

H. 174

 

Even supposing that what “they” have surmised and scented out should
some  day  be  actually  translated  into  deeds,  ambiguity  has  already  taken
care that interest in what has been Realised will promptly die away. Indeed
this  interest  persists,  in  a  kind  of  curiosity  and  idle  talk,  only  so  long  as
there is a possibility of a non-committal just-surmising-with-someone-else.
Being  “in  on  it”  with  someone  [das  Mit-dabei-sein]  when  one  is  on  the
scent, and so long as one is on it, precludes one’s allegiance when what has
been surmised gets carried out. For in such a case Dasein is in every case
forced  back  on  itself.  Idle  talk  and  curiosity  lose  their  power,  and  are
already  exacting  their  penalty.(2)  When  confronted  with  the  carrying-
through of what “they” have surmised together, idle talk readily establishes
that “they” “could have done that too”—for “they” have indeed surmised it
together. In the end, idle talk is even indignant that what it has surmised and
constantly  demanded  now  actually  happens.  In  that  case,  indeed,  the
opportunity to keep on surmising has been snatched away.
 

1. ‘…ist die verfänglichste Weise, in der die Zweideutigkeit Möglichkeiten des Daseins vorgibt,
um sie auch schon in ihrer Kraft zu ersticken.’ (Notice that ‘ihrer’ may refer to ‘Zweideutigkeit’ or to
‘Möglichkeiten’.)

2. ‘Und sie rächen sich auch schon.’

But  when  Dasein  goes  in  for  something  in  the  reticence  of  carrying  it
through  or  even  of  genuinely  breaking  down  on  it,  its  time  is  a  different
time and, as seen by the public, an essentially slower time than that of idle
talk, which ‘lives at a faster rate’. Idle talk will thus long since have gone
on to something else which is currently the very newest thing. That which
was earlier surmise and has now been carried through, has come too late if
one looks at that which is newest. Idle talk and curiosity take care in their
ambiguity to ensure that what is genuinely and newly created is out of date
as  soon  as  it  emerges  before  the  public.  Such  a  new  creation  can  become

free in its positive possibilities only if the idle talk which covers it up has
become ineffective, and if the ‘common’ interest has died away.

In  the  ambiguity  of  the  way  things  have  been  publicly  interpreted,
talking  about  things  ahead  of  the  game  and  making  surmises  about  them
curiously,  gets  passed  off  as  what  is  really  happening,  while  taking  action
and  carrying  something  through  get  stamped  as  something  merely
subsequent and unimportant. Thus Dasein’s understanding in the “they” is
constantly going wrong [versieht sich] in its projects, as regards the genuine
possibilities of Being. Dasein is always ambiguously ‘there’—that is to say,
in  that  public  disclosedness  of  Being-with-one-another  where  the  loudest
idle talk and the most ingenious curiosity keep ‘things moving’, where, in
an everyday manner, everything (and at bottom nothing) is happening.

This ambiguity is always tossing to curiosity that which it seeks; and it

gives idle talk the semblance of having everything decided in it.

H. 175

 

But  this  kind  of  Being  of  the  disclosedness  of  Being-in-the-world
dominates  also  Being-with-one-another  as  such.  The  Other  is  proximally
‘there’  in  terms  of  what  “they”  have  heard  about  him,  what  “they”  say  in
their  talk  about  him,  and  what  “they”  know  about  him.  Into  primordial
Being-with-one-another,  idle  talk  first  slips  itself  in  between.  Everyone
keeps  his  eye  on  the  Other  first  and  next,  watching  how  he  will  comport
himself and what he will say in reply. Being-with-one-another in the “they”
is  by  no  means  an  indifferent  side-by-side-ness  in  which  everything  has
been  settled,  but  rather  an  intent,  ambiguous  watching  of  one  another,  a
secret and reciprocal listening-in. Under the mask of “for-one-another”, an
“against-one-another” is in play.

In  this  connection,  we  must  notice  that  ambiguity  does  not  first  arise
from aiming explicitly at disguise or distortion, and that it is not something
which the individual Dasein first conjures up. It is already implied in Being
with  one  another,  as  thrown Being-with-one-another  in  a  world.  Publicly,
however,  it  is  quite  hidden;  and  “they”  will  always  defend  themselves
against  this  Interpretation  of  the  kind  of  Being  which  belongs  to  the  way
things  have  been  interpreted  by  the  “they”,  lest  it  should  prove  correct.  It
would be a misunderstanding if we were to seek to have the explication of
these phenomena confirmed by looking to the “they” for agreement.

The phenomena of idle talk, curiosity, and ambiguity have been set forth
in such a manner as to indicate that they are already interconnected in their
Being. We must now grasp in an existential-ontological manner the kind of
Being which belongs to this interconnection. The basic kind of Being which
belongs  to  everydayness  is  to  be  understood  within  the  horizon  of  those
structures of Dasein’s Being which have been hitherto obtained.

38. Falling and Thrownness

Idle  talk,  curiosity  and  ambiguity  characterize  the  way  in  which,  in  an
everyday manner, Dasein is its ‘there’—the disclosedness of Being-in-the-
world.  As  definite  existential  characteristics,  these  are  not  present-at-hand
in Dasein, but help to make up its Being. In these, and in the way they are
interconnected in their Being, there is revealed a basic kind of Being which
belongs to everydayness; we call this the “falling”(1) of Dasein.
 

1. ‘Verfallen’. See our note 2, H. 21, and note 1, H. 134 above.

 

 

H. 176

This term does not express any negative evaluation, but is used to signify
that Dasein is proximally and for the most part alongside the ‘world’ of its
concern.  This  “absorption  in...”  [Aufgehen bei...]  has mostly  the  character
of  Being-lost  in  the  publicness  of  the  “they”.  Dasein  has,  in  the  first
instance, fallen away [abgefallen] from itself as an authentic potentiality for
Being  its  Self,  and  has  fallen  into  the  ‘world’.(1)  “Fallenness”  into  the
‘world’  means  an  absorption  in  Being-with-one-another,  in  so  far  as  the
latter  is  guided  by  idle  talk,  curiosity,  and  ambiguity.  Through  the
Interpretation  of  falling,  what  we  have  called  the  “inauthenticity”  of
Dasein(xiii) may now be defined more precisely. On no account, however,
do the terms “inauthentic” and “non-authentic” signify ‘really not’,(2) as if
in  this  mode  of  Being,  Dasein  were  altogether  to  lose  its  Being.
“Inauthenticity” does not mean anything like Being-no-longer-in-the-world,
but  amounts  rather  to  a  quite  distinctive  kind  of  Being-in-the-world—the
kind  which  is  completely  fascinated  by  the  world  and  by  Dasein-with  of
Others in the “they”. Not-Being-its-self [Das Nicht-es-selbst-sein] functions

as  a  positive  possibility  of  that  entity  which,  in  its  essential  concern,  is
absorbed in a world. This kind of not-Being has to be conceived as that kind
of Being which is closest to Dasein and in which Dasein maintains itself for
the most part.

So neither must we take the fallenness of Dasein as a ‘fall’ from a purer
and  higher  ‘primal  status’.  Not  only  do  we  lack  any  experience  of  this
ontically,  but  ontologically  we  lack  any  possibilities  or  clues  for
Interpreting it.

In falling, Dasein itself as factical Being-in-the-world, is something from
which  it  has  already  fallen  away.  And  it  has  not  fallen  into  some  entity
which it comes upon for the first time in the course of its Being, or even one
which it has not come upon at all; it has fallen into the world, which itself
belongs to its Being. Falling is a definite existential characteristic of Dasein
itself. It makes no assertion about Dasein as something present-at-hand, or
about present-at-hand relations to entities from which Dasein ‘is descended’
or  with  which  Dasein  has  subsequently  wound  up  in  some  sort  of
commercium.

We  would  also  misunderstand  the  ontologico-existential  structure  of
falling(3)  if  we  were  to  ascribe  to  it  the  sense  of  a  bad  and  deplorable
ontical property of which, perhaps, more advanced stages of human culture
might be able to rid themselves.
 

xiii. Cf. Section 9, H. 42 ff.

 

1. ‘…und an die “Welt” verfallen.’ While we shall follow English idioms by translating ‘an die
“Welt” ’ as ‘into the “world” ’ in contexts such as this, the preposition ‘into’ is hardly the correct one.
The idea is rather that of falling at the world or collapsing against it.

2. ‘Un- und nichteigentlich, bedeutet aber keineswegs “eigentlich nicht”…’
3.  ‘Die  ontologisch-existenziale  Struktur  des  Verfallens...’  The  words  ‘des  Verfallens’  do  not

appear in the earlier editions.

Neither in our first allusion to Being-in-the-world as Dasein’s basic state,
nor  in  our  characterization  of  its  constitutive  structural  items,  did  we  go
beyond an analysis of the constitution of this kind of Being and take note of
its  character  as  a  phenomenon.  We  have  indeed  described  concern  and
solicitude, as the  possible  basic kinds  of Being-in. But we  did  not  discuss
the question of the everyday kind of Being of these ways in which one may
be. We also showed that Being-in is something quite different from a mere
confrontation, whether by way of observation or by way of action; that is, it

is  not  the  Being-present-at-hand-together  of  a  subject  and  an  Object.
Nevertheless,  it  must  still  have  seemed  that  Being-in-the-world  has  the
function  of  a  rigid  framework,  within  which  Dasein’s  possible  ways  of
comporting  itself  towards  its  world  run  their  course  without  touching  the
‘framework’  itself  as  regards  its  Being.  But  this  supposed  ‘framework’
itself  helps  make  up  the  kind  of  Being  which  is  Dasein’s.  An  existential
mode of Being-in-the-world is documented in the phenomenon of falling.

H. 177

 

Idle talk discloses to Dasein a Being towards its world, towards Others,
and towards itself—a Being in which these are understood, but in a mode of
groundless  floating.  Curiosity  discloses  everything  and  anything,  yet  in
such  a  way  that  Being-in  is  everywhere  and  nowhere.  Ambiguity  hides
nothing  from  Dasein’s  understanding,  but  only  in  order  that  Being-in-the-
world should be suppressed in this uprooted “everywhere and nowhere”.

By  elucidating  ontologically  the  kind  of  Being  belonging  to  everyday
Being-in-the-world as it shows through in these phenomena, we first arrive
at an existentially adequate determination of Dasein’s basic state. Which is
the structure that shows us the ‘movement’ of falling?

Idle talk and the way things have been publicly interpreted (which idle
talk includes) constitute themselves in Being-with-one-another. Idle talk is
not  something  present-at-hand  for  itself  within  the  world,  as  a  product
detached  from  Being-with-one-another.  And  it  is  just  as  far  from  letting
itself  be  volatilized  to  something  ‘universal’  which,  because  it  belongs
essentially  to  nobody,  is  ‘really’  nothing  and  occurs  as  ‘Real’  only  in  the
individual Dasein which speaks. Idle talk is the kind of Being that belongs
to  Being-with-one-another  itself;  it  does  not  first  arise  through  certain
circumstances which have effects upon Dasein ‘from outside’. But if Dasein
itself,  in  idle  talk  and  in  the  way  things  have  been  publicly  interpreted,
presents to itself the possibility of losing itself in the “they” and falling into
groundlessness,  this  tells  us  that  Dasein  prepares  for  itself  a  constant
temptation  towards  falling.  Being-in-the-world  is  in  itself  tempting
[versucherisch].

Since the way in which things have been publicly interpreted has already
become  a  temptation  to  itself  in  this  manner,  it  holds  Dasein  fast  in  its
fallenness.  Idle  talk  and  ambiguity,  having  seen  everything,  having

understood everything, develop the supposition that Dasein’s disclosedness,
which is so available and so prevalent, can guarantee to Dasein that all the
possibilities of its Being will be secure, genuine, and full. Through the self-
certainty and decidedness of the “they”, it gets spread abroad increasingly
that  there  is  no  need  of  authentic  understanding  or  the  state-of-mind  that
goes with it. The supposition of the “they” that one is leading and sustaining
a full and genuine ‘life’, brings Dasein a tranquillity, for  which  everything
is ‘in the best of order’ and all doors are open. Falling Being-in-the-world,
which tempts itself, is at the same time tranquillizing [beruhigend].

H. 178

 

inactivity,  but  drives  one 

However, this tranquillity in inauthentic Being does not seduce one into
stagnation  and 
into  uninhibited  ‘hustle’
[“Betriebs”]. Being-fallen into the ‘world’ does not now somehow come to
rest.  The  tempting  tranquillization  aggravates  the  falling.  With  special
regard  to  the  interpretation  of  Dasein,  the  opinion  may  now  arise  that
understanding  the  most  alien  cultures  and  ‘synthesizing’  them  with  one’s
own  may  lead  to  Dasein’s  becoming  for  the  first  time  thoroughly  and
genuinely  enlightened  about  itself.  Versatile  curiosity  and  restlessly
“knowing it all” masquerade as a universal understanding of Dasein. But at
bottom  it  remains  indefinite  what  is  really  to  be  understood,  and  the
question  has  not  even  been  asked.  Nor  has  it  been  understood  that
understanding itself is a potentiality-for-Being which must be made free in
one’s  ownmost  Dasein  alone.  When  Dasein, 
tranquillized,  and
‘understanding’  everything,  thus  compares  itself  with  everything,  it  drifts
its  ownmost
along 
potentiality-for-Being  is  hidden  from  it.  Falling  Being-in-the-world  is  not
only tempting and tranquillizing; it is at the same time alienating.

towards  an  alienation  [Entfremdung] 

in  which 

Yet  this  alienation  cannot  mean  that  Dasein  gets  factically  torn  away
from  itself.  On  the  contrary,  this  alienation  drives  it  into  a  kind  of  Being
which  borders  on  the  most  exaggerated  ‘self-dissection’,  tempting  itself
with all possibilities of explanation, so that the very ‘characterologies’ and
‘typologies’ which it has brought about(1) are themselves already becoming
something  that  cannot  be  surveyed  at  a  glance.  This  alienation  closes  off
from  Dasein  its  authenticity  and  possibility,  even  if  only  the  possibility  of
genuinely  foundering.  It  does  not,  however,  surrender  Dasein  to  an  entity

which  Dasein  itself  is  not,  but  forces  it  into  its  inauthenticity—into  a
possible kind of Being of itself. The alienation of falling—at once tempting
and  tranquillizing—leads  by  its  own  movement,  to  Dasein’s  getting
entangled [verfängt] in itself.
 

1. ‘...die von ihr gezeitigten...’ We follow the difficilior lectio of the earlier editions. The newer
editions have ‘...die von ihr gezeigten...’ (‘...which it has shown...’). See H. 304 below, and our note
ad loc.

The  phenomena  we  have  pointed  out—temptation,  tranquillizing,
alienation  and  self-entangling  (entanglement)—characterize  the  specific
kind  of  Being  which  belongs  to  falling.  This  ‘movement’  of  Dasein  in  its
own Being, we call its “downward plunge” [Absturz]. Dasein plunges out of
itself  into  itself,  into  the  groundlessness  and  nullity  of  inauthentic
everydayness.  But  this  plunge  remains  hidden  from  Dasein  by  the  way
things  have  been  publicly  interpreted,  so  much  so,  indeed,  that  it  gets
interpreted as a way of ‘ascending’ and ‘living concretely’.

This  downward  plunge  into  and  within  the  groundlessness  of  the
inauthentic Being of the “they”, has a kind of motion which constantly tears
the  understanding  away  from  the  projecting  of  authentic  possibilities,  and
into  the  tranquillized  supposition  that  it  possesses  everything,  or  that
everything  is  within  its  reach.  Since  the  understanding  is  thus  constantly
torn away from authenticity and into the “they” (though always with a sham
of  authenticity),  the  movement  of  falling  is  characterized  by  turbulence
[Wirbel].

H. 179

 

Falling is not only existentially determinative for Being-in-the-world. At
the  same  time  turbulence  makes  manifest  that  the  thrownness  which  can
obtrude  itself  upon  Dasein  in  its  state-of-mind,  has  the  character  of
throwing  and  of  movement.  Thrownness  is  neither  a  ‘fact  that  is  finished’
nor  a  Fact  that  is  settled.(1)  Dasein’s  facticity  is  such  that  as  long  as it  is
what it is, Dasein remains in the throw, and is sucked into the turbulence of
the “they’s” inauthenticity. Thrownness, in which facticity lets itself be seen
phenomenally, belongs to Dasein, for which, in its Being, that very Being is
an issue. Dasein exists factically.
 

1.  ‘Die  Geworfenheit  ist  nicht  nur  nicht  eine  “fertige  Tatsache”,  sondern  auch  nicht  ein

abgeschlossenes Faktum.’

But  now  that  falling  has  been  exhibited,  have  we  not  set  forth  a
phenomenon  which  speaks  directly against the  definition  we  have  used  in
indicating  the  formal  idea  of  existence?  Can  Dasein  be  conceived  as  an
entity  for  which,  in  its  Being,  its  potentiality-for-Being  is  an  issue, if  this
entity, in its very everydayness, has lost itself, and, in falling, ‘lives’ away
from  itself?  But  falling  into  the  world  would  be  phenomenal  ‘evidence’
against  the  existentiality  of  Dasein  only  if  Dasein  were  regarded  as  an
isolated  “I”  or  subject,  as  a  self-point  from  which  it  moves  away.  In  that
case, the world would be an Object. Falling into the world would then have
to be re-Interpreted ontologically as Being-present-at-hand in the manner of
an  entity  within-the-world.  If,  however,  we  keep  in  mind  that  Dasein’s
Being is in the state of Being-in-the-world, as we have already pointed out,
then  it  becomes  manifest  that  falling,  as  a  kind  of  Being  of  this  Being-in,
affords us rather the most elemental evidence for Dasein’s existentiality. In
falling,  nothing  other  than  our  potentiality-for-Being-in  world  is  the  issue,
even if in the mode of inauthenticity. Dasein can fall  only because Being-
in-the-world understandingly with a state-of-mind is an issue for it. On the
other hand, authentic existence is not something which floats above falling
everydayness;  existentially,  it  is  only  a  modified  way  in  which  such
everydayness is seized upon.

The  phenomenon  of  falling  does  not  give  us  something  like  a  ‘night
view’ of Dasein, a property which occurs ontically and may serve to round
out  the  innocuous  aspects  of  this  entity.  Falling  reveals  an  essential
ontological  structure  of  Dasein  itself.  Far  from  determining  its  nocturnal
side, it constitutes all Dasein’s days in their everydayness.

H. 180

 

It follows that our existential-ontological Interpretation makes no ontical
assertion about the ‘corruption of human Nature’, not because the necessary
evidence  is  lacking,  but  because  the  problematic  of  this  Interpretation  is
prior to any assertion about corruption or incorruption. Falling is conceived
ontologically as a kind of motion. Ontically, we have not decided whether
man is ‘drunk with sin’ and in the status corruptionis, whether he walks in

the status integritatis, or whether he finds himself in an intermediate stage,
the status  gratiae.  But  in  so  far  as  any  faith  or  ‘world  view’,  makes  any
such  assertions,  and  if  it  asserts  anything  about  Dasein  as  Being-in-the-
world,  it  must  come  back  to  the  existential  structures  which  we  have  set
forth,  provided  that  its  assertions  are  to  make  a  claim  to  conceptual
understanding.

VI: CARE AS THE BEING OF DASEIN

 

 

 

39.  The  Question  of  the  Primordial  Totality  of  Dasein’s  Structural

Whole
 

H. 181

BEING-IN-THE-WORLD  is  a  structure  which  is  primordially  and
constantly whole. In  the  preceding  chapters  (Division  One,  Chapters  2-5)
this structure has been elucidated phenomenally as a whole, and also in its
constitutive  items,  though  always  on  this  basis.  The  preliminary  glance
which  we  gave  to  the  whole  of  this  phenomenon  in  the  beginning(i)  has
now  lost  the  emptiness  of  our  first  general  sketch  of  it.  To  be  sure,  the
constitution  of  the  structural  whole  and  its  everyday  kind  of  Being,  is
phenomenally  so  manifold  that  it  can  easily  obstruct  our  looking  at  the
whole as such phenomenologically in a way which is unified. But we may
look  at  it more  freely and our unified  view of it may  be held  in  readiness
more  securely  if  we  now  raise  the  question  towards  which  we  have  been
working  in  our  preparatory  fundamental  analysis  of  Dasein  in  general:
“how is the totality of that structural whole which we have pointed out to be
defined in an existential-ontological manner?”
 

i. Cf. Section 12, H. 52 ff.

Dasein  exists  factically.  We  shall  inquire  whether  existentiality  and
facticity have an ontological unity, or whether facticity belongs essentially
to  existentiality.  Because  Dasein  essentially  has  a  state-of-mind  belonging
to  it,  Dasein  has  a  kind  of  Being  in  which  it  is  brought  before  itself  and
becomes disclosed to itself in its thrownness. But thrownness, as a kind of
Being,  belongs  to  an  entity  which  in  each  case  is  its  possibilities,  and  is
them  in  such  a  way  that  it  understands  itself  in  these  possibilities  and  in
terms  of  them,  projecting  itself  upon  them.  Being  alongside  the  ready-to-

hand, belongs just as primordially to Being-in-the-world as does Being-with
Others;  and  Being-in-the-world  is  in  each  case  for  the  sake  of  itself.  The
Self, however, is proximally and for the most part inauthentic, the they-self.
Being-in-the-world  is  always  fallen.  Accordingly  Dasein’s  “average
everydayness”  can  be  defines  as  “Being-in-the-world  which  is  falling  and
disclosed,  thrown  and  projecting,  and  for  which  its  ownmost  potentiality-
for-Being  is  an  issue,  both  in  its  Being  alongside  the  ‘world’  and  in  its
Being-with Others”.

Can  we  succeed  in  grasping  this  structural  whole  of  Dasein’s
everydayness  in  its  totality?  Can  Dasein’s  Being  be  brought  out  in  such  a
unitary  manner  that  in  terms  of  it  the  essential  equiprimordiality  of  the
structures  we  have  pointed  out,  as  well  as  their  existential  possibilities  of
modification,  will  become  intelligible?  Does  our  present  approach  via  the
existential  analytic  provide  us  an  avenue  for  arriving  at  this  Being
phenomenally?

To  put  it  negatively,  it  is  beyond  question  that  the  totality  of  the
structural whole is not to be reached by building it up out of elements. For
this  we  would  need  an  architect’s  plan.  The  Being  of  Dasein,  upon  which
the structural whole as such is ontologically supported, becomes accessible
to us when we look all the way through this whole to a single primordially
unitary  phenomenon  which  is  already  in  this  whole  in  such  a  way  that  it
provides the ontological foundation for each structural item in its structural
possibility. Thus we cannot Interpret this ‘comprehensively’ by a process of
gathering  up  what  we  have  hitherto  gained  and  taking  it  all  together.  The
question of Dasein’s basic existential character is essentially different from
that  of 
the  Being  of  something  present-at-hand.  Our  everyday
environmental  experiencing  [Erfahren],  which  remains  directed  both
ontically and ontologically towards entities within-the-world, is not the sort
of  thing  which  can  present  Dasein  in  an  ontically  primordial  manner  for
ontological  analysis.  Similarly  our  immanent  perception  of  Experiences
[Erlebnissen] fails to provide a clue which is ontologically adequate. On the
other hand, Dasein’s Being is not be to deduced from an idea of man. Does
the Interpretation of Dasein which we have hitherto given permit us to infer
what  Dasein,  from  its  own  standpoint,  demands  as  the  only  appropriate
ontico-ontological way of access to itself?

H. 182

 

An understanding of Being belongs to Dasein’s ontological structure. As
something that  i s  [Seiend], it is disclosed to itself in its Being. The kind of
Being  which  belongs  to  this  disclosedness  is  constituted  by  state-of-mind
and  understanding.  Is  there  in  Dasein  an  understanding  state-of-mind  in
which Dasein has been disclosed to itself in some distinctive way?

If the existential analytic of Dasein is to retain clarity in principle as to
its function in fundamental ontology, then in order to master its provisional
task  of  exhibiting  Dasein’s  Being,  it  must  seek  for  one  of  the  most  far-
reaching  and  most  primordial  possibilities  of  disclosure—one  that  lies  in
Dasein  itself.  The  way  of  disclosure  in  which  Dasein  brings  itself  before
itself  must  be  such  that  in  it  Dasein  becomes  accessible  as  simplified  in  a
certain  manner.  With  what  is  thus  disclosed,  the  structural  totality  of  the
Being we seek must then come to light in an elemental way.

As a state-of-mind which will satisfy these methodological requirements,
the  phenomenon  of  anxiety(1)  will  be  made  basic  for  our  analysis.  In
working  out  this  basic  state-of-mind  characterizing  ontologically  what  is
disclosed in it as such, we shall take the phenomenon of falling as our point
of departure, and distinguish anxiety from the kindred phenomenon of fear,
which we have analysed earlier. As one of Dasein’s possibilities of Being,
anxiety—together  with  Dasein  itself  as  disclosed  in  it—provides  the
phenomenal  basis  for  explicitly  grasping  Dasein’s  primordial  totality  of
Being. Dasein’s Being reveals itself as care. If we are to work out this basic
existential  phenomenon,  we  must  distinguish  it  from  phenomena  which
might be proximally identified with care, such as will, wish, addiction, and
urge.(2)  Care  cannot  be  derived  from  these,  since  they  themselves  are
founded upon it.
 

1.  ‘Angst’.  While  this  word  has  generally  been  translated  as  ‘anxiety’  in  the  post-Freudian
psychological literature, it appears as ‘dread’ in the translations of Kierkegaard and in a number of
discussions of Heidegger. In some ways ‘uneasiness’ or ‘malaise’ would be more appropriate still.

2. ‘...Wille, Wunsch, Hang und Drang.’ For further discussion see H. 194 ff. below.

H. 183

 

Like every ontological analysis, the ontological Interpretation of Dasein
as  care,  with  whatever  we  may  gain  from  such  an  Interpretation,  lies  far
from  what  is  accessible  to  the  pre-ontological  understanding  of  Being  or

even to our ontical acquaintance with entities. It is not surprising that when
the common understanding has regard to that with which it has only ontical
familiarity, that which is known ontologically seems rather strange to it. In
spite of this, even the ontical approach with which we have tried to Interpret
Dasein  ontologically  as  care,  may  appear  farfetched  and  theoretically
contrived,  to  say  nothing  of  the  act  of  violence  one  might  discern  in  our
setting aside the confirmed traditional definition of “man”. Accordingly our
existential  Interpretation  of  Dasein  as  care  requires  pre-ontological
confirmation.  This  lies  in  demonstrating  that  no  sooner  has  Dasein
expressed anything about itself to itself, than it has already interpreted itself
as care (cura), even though it has done so only pre-ontologically.

The analytic of Dasein, which is proceeding towards the phenomenon of
care, is to prepare the way for the problematic of fundamental ontology—
the question of the meaning of Being in general. In order that we may turn
our glance explicitly upon this in the light of what we have gained, and go
beyond  the  special  task  of  an  existentially a  priori anthropology,  we  must
look  back  and  get  a  more  penetrating  grasp  of  the  phenomena  which  are
most  intimately  connected  with  our  leading  question—the  question  of
Being. These phenomena are those very ways of Being which we have been
hitherto explaining: readiness-to-hand and presence-at-hand, as attributes of
entities within-the-world whose character is not that of Dasein. Because the
ontological problematic of Being has heretofore been understood primarily
in  the  sense  of  presence-at-hand  (‘Reality’,  ‘world-actuality’),  while  the
nature of Dasein’s Being has remained ontologically undetermined, we need
to discuss the ontological interconnections of care, worldhood, readiness-to-
hand,  and  presence-at-hand  (Reality).  This  will  lead  to  a  more  precise
characterization of the concept of Reality in  the  context  of  a  discussion  of
the epistemological questions oriented by this idea which have been raised
in realism and idealism.

Entities  are,  quite  independently  of  the  experience  by  which  they  are
disclosed, the acquaintance in which they are discovered, and the grasping
in  which  their  nature  is  ascertained.  But  Being  ‘is’  only  in  the
understanding  of  those  entities  to  whose  Being  something  like  an
understanding  of  Being  belongs.  Hence  Being  can  be  something
unconceptualized,  but  it  never  completely  fails  to  be  understood.  In
ontological  problematics  Being  and  truth  have,  from  time  immemorial,
been brought together if not entirely identified. This is evidence that there is

a  necessary  connection  between  Being  and  understanding,  even  if  it  may
perhaps be hidden in its primordial grounds. If we are to give an adequate
preparation  for  the  question  of  Being,  the  phenomenon  of  truth  must  be
ontologically clarified. This will be accomplished in the first instance on the
basis of what we have gained in our foregoing Interpretation, in connection
with the phenomena of disclosedness and discoveredness, interpretation and
assertion.

H. 184

 

Thus our preparatory fundamental analysis of Dasein will conclude with
the following themes: the basic state-of-mind of anxiety as a distinctive way
in which Dasein is disclosed (Section 40); Dasein’s Being as care (Section
41); the  confirmation  of  the  existential  Interpretation  of  Dasein  as  care  in
terms  of  Dasein’s  pre-ontological  way  of  interpreting  itself  (Section  42);
Dasein,  worldhood,  and  Reality  (Section  43);  Dasein,  disclosedness,  and
truth (Section 44).

40. The Basic State-of-mind of Anxiety as a Distinctive Way in which

Dasein is Disclosed
 

One of Dasein’s possibilities of Being is to give us ontical ‘information’
about  Dasein  itself  as  an  entity.  Such  information  is  possible  only  in  that
disclosedness  which  belongs  to  Dasein  and  which  is  grounded  in  state-of-
mind  and  understanding.  How  far  is  anxiety  a  state-of-mind  which  is
distinctive?  How  is  it  that  in  anxiety  Dasein  gets  brought  before  itself
through  its  own  Being,  so  that  we  can  define  phenomenologically  the
character  of  the  entity  disclosed  in  anxiety,  and  define  it  as  such  in  its
Being, or make adequate preparations for doing so?

Since  our  aim  is  to  proceed  towards  the  Being  of  the  totality  of  the
structural  whole,  we  shall  take  as  our  point  of  departure  the  concrete
analyses of falling which we have just carried through. Dasein’s absorption
in the “they” and its absorption in the ‘world’ of its concern, make manifest
something  like  a  fleeing  of  Dasein  in  the  face  of  itself—of  itself  as  an
authentic  potentiality-for-Being-its-Self.(1)  This  phenomenon  of  Dasein’s
fleeing in the face of itself and in the face of its authenticity, seems at least a

suitable phenomenal basis for the following investigation. But to bring itself
face  to  face  with  itself, is  precisely what Dasein does not do  when  it thus
flees. It turns away from itself in accordance with its ownmost inertia [Zug]
of  falling.  In  investigating  such  phenomena,  however,  we  must  be  careful
not 
to  confuse  ontico-existentiell  characterization  with  ontologico-
existential  Interpretation  nor  may  we  overlook  the  positive  phenomenal
bases provided for this Interpretation by such a characterization.

H. 185

 

From  an  existentiell  point  of  view,  the  authenticity  of  Being-one’s-Self
has  of  course  been  closed  off  and  thrust  aside  in  falling;  but  to  be  thus
closed off is merely the privation of a disclosedness which manifests itself
phenomenally  in  the  fact  that  Dasein’s  fleeing  is  a  fleeing  in  the  face  of
itself.  That  in  the  face  of  which  Dasein  flees,  is  precisely  what  Dasein
comes  up  ‘behind’.(2)  Only  to  the  extent  that  Dasein  has  been  brought
before  itself  in  an  ontologically  essential  manner  through  whatever
disclosedness belongs to it, can it flee in the face of that in the face of which
it flees. To be sure, that in the face of which it flees is not grasped in  thus
turning  away  [Abkehr]  in  falling;  nor  is  it  experienced  even  in  turning
thither  [Hinkehr].  Rather,  in  turning  away  from  it,  it  is  disclosed  ‘there’.
This  existentiell-ontical  turning-away,  by  reason  of  its  character  as  a
disclosure,  makes 
to  grasp  existential-
ontologically that in the face of which Dasein flees, and to grasp it as such.
Within the ontical ‘away-from’ which such turning-away implies, that in the
face  of  which  Dasein  flees  can  be  understood  and  conceptualized  by
‘turning thither’ in a way which is phenomenologically Interpretative.
 

it  phenomenally  possible 

1. ‘…offenbart so etwas wie eine Flucht des Daseins vor ihm selbst als eigentlichem Selbst-sein-
können.’ The point of this paragraph is that if we are to study the totality of Dasein, Dasein must be
brought  ‘before  itself’  or  ‘face  to  face  with  itself’  (‘vor  es  selbst’);  and  the  fact  that  Dasein  flees
‘from itself’  or  ‘in  the  face  of  itself’  (‘vor ihm selbst’), which  may  seem  at  first  to  lead  us  off  the
track, is actually very germane to our inquiry.

2. ‘Im Wovor der Flucht kommt das Dasein gerade “hinter” ihm her.’

So in orienting our analysis by the phenomenon of falling, we are not in
principle  condemned  to  be  without  any  prospect  of  learning  something
ontologically  about  the  Dasein  disclosed  in  that  phenomenon.  On  the

contrary,  here,  least  of  all,  has  our  Interpretation  been  surrendered  to  an
artificial  way  in  which  Dasein  grasps  itself;  it  merely  carries  out  the
explication  of  what  Dasein  itself  ontically  discloses.  The  possibility  of
proceeding towards Dasein’s Being by going along with it and following it
up  [Mit-  und  Nachgehen]  Interpretatively  with  an  understanding  and  the
state-of-mind  that  goes  with  it,  is  the  greater,  the  more  primordial  is  that
phenomenon  which  functions  methodologically  as  a  disclosive  state-of-
mind. It might be contended that anxiety performs some such functions.

We are not entirely unprepared for the analysis of anxiety. Of course it
still  remains  obscure  how  this  is  connected  ontologically  with  fear.
Obviously these are kindred phenomena. This is betokened by the fact that
for  the  most  part  they  have  not  been  distinguished  from  one  another:  that
which  is  fear,  gets  designated  as  “anxiety”,  while  that  which  has  the
character of anxiety, gets called “fear”. We shall try to proceed towards the
phenomenon of anxiety step by step.

Dasein’s falling into the “they” and the ‘world’ of its concern, is what we
have called a ‘fleeing’ in the face of itself. But one is not necessarily fleeing
whenever one shrinks back in the face of something or turns away from it.
Shrinking back in the face of what fear discloses—in the face of something
threatening—is  founded  upon  fear;  and  this  shrinking  back  has  the
character of fleeing. Our Interpretation of fear as a state-of-mind has shown
that  in  each  case  that  in  the  face  of  which  we  fear  is  a  detrimental  entity
within-the-world  which  comes  from  some  definite  region  but  is  close  by
and is bringing itself close, and yet might stay away. In falling, Dasein turns
away from  i t s e l f. That in the face of which it thus shrinks back must, in
any case, be an entity with the character of threatening; yet this entity has
the same kind of Being as the one that shrinks back: it is Dasein itself. That
in  the  face  of  which  it  thus  shrinks  back  cannot  be  taken  as  something
‘fearsome’,  for  anything  ‘fearsome’  is  always  encountered  as  an  entity
within-the-world. The only threatening which can be ‘fearsome’ and which
gets discovered in fear, always comes from entities within-the-world.

H. 186

 

Thus the turning-away of falling is not a fleeing that is founded upon a
fear  of  entities  within-the-world.  Fleeing  that  is  so  grounded  is  still  less  a
character  of  this  turning-away,  when  what  this  turning-away  does  is

precisely  to  turn  thither  towards  entities  within-the-world  by  absorbing
itself  in  them.  The  turning-away  of  falling  is  grounded  rather  in  anxiety,
which in turn is what first makes fear possible.

To  understand  this  talk  about  Dasein’s  fleeing  in  the  face  of  itself  in
falling,  we  must  recall  that  Being-in-the-world  is  a  basic  state  of  Dasein.
That in the face of which one has anxiety [das Wovor der Angst] is Being-
in-the-world  as  such.  What  is  different  phenomenally  between  that  in  the
face of which anxiety is anxious [sich ängstet] and that in the face of which
fear  is  afraid?  That  in  the  face  of  which  one  has  anxiety  is  not  an  entity
within-the-world. Thus it is essentially incapable of having an involvement.
This  threatening  does  not  have  the  character  of  a  definite  detrimentality
which reaches what is threatened, and which reaches it with definite regard
to a special factical potentiality-for-Being. That in the face of which one is
anxious  is  completely  indefinite.  Not  only  does  this  indefiniteness  leave
factically undecided which entity within-the-world is threatening us, but it
also tells us that entities within-the-world are not ‘relevant’ at all. Nothing
which is ready-to-hand or present-at-hand within the world functions as that
in the face of which anxiety is anxious. Here the totality of involvements of
the  ready-to-hand  and  the  present-at-hand  discovered  within-the-world,  is,
as  such,  of  no  consequence;  it  collapses  into  itself;  the  world  has  the
character  of  completely  lacking  significance.  In  anxiety  one  does  not
encounter  this  thing  or  that  thing  which,  as  something  threatening,  must
have an involvement.

Accordingly,  when  something  threatening  brings  itself  close,  anxiety
does not ‘see’ any definite ‘here’ or ‘yonder’ from which it comes. That in
the  face  of  which  one  has  anxiety  is  characterized  by  the  fact  that  what
threatens  is  nowhere.  Anxiety  ‘does  not  know’  what  that  in  the  face  of
which it is anxious is. ‘Nowhere’, however, does not signify nothing: this is
where any region lies, and there too lies any disclosedness of the world for
essentially  spatial  Being-in.  Therefore  that  which  threatens  cannot  bring
itself  close  from  a  definite  direction  within  what  is  close  by;  it  is  already
‘there’, and yet nowhere; it is so close that it is oppressive and stifles one’s
breath, and yet it is nowhere.

H. 187

 

In  that  in  the  face  of  which  one  has  anxiety,  the  ‘It  is  nothing  and
nowhere’  becomes  manifest.  The  obstinacy  of  the  “nothing  and  nowhere
within-the-world” means as a phenomenon that the world as such is that in
the  face  of  which  one  has  anxiety.  The  utter  insignificance  which  makes
itself known in the “nothing and nowhere”, does not signify that the world
is  absent,  but  tells  us  that  entities  within-the-world  are  of  so  little
importance in themselves that on the basis of this insignificance of what is
within-the-world, the world in its worldhood is all that still obtrudes itself.

What  oppresses  us  is  not  this  or  that,  nor  is  it  the  summation  of
everything  present-at-hand; it is  rather the possibility  of  the  ready-to-hand
in general; that is to say, it is the world itself. When anxiety has subsided,
then in our everyday way of talking we are accustomed to say that ‘it was
really nothing’. And what it was, indeed, does get reached ontically by such
a way of talking. Everyday discourse tends towards concerning itself with
the ready-to-hand and talking about it. That in the face of which anxiety is
anxious is nothing ready-to-hand within-the-world. But this “nothing ready-
to-hand”, which only our everyday circumspective discourse understands, is
not  totally  nothing.(1)  The  “nothing”  of  readiness-to-hand  is  grounded  in
the most primordial ‘something’—in the world. Ontologically, however, the
world belongs essentially to Dasein’s Being as Being-in-the-world. So if the
“nothing”—that is, the world as such—exhibits itself as that in the face of
which  one  has  anxiety,  this  means  that  Being-in-the-world  itself  is  that  in
the face of which anxiety is anxious.

Being-anxious discloses, primordially and directly, the world as world. It
is not the case, say, that the world first gets thought of by deliberating about
it, just by itself, without regard for the entities within-the-world, and that, in
the face of this world, anxiety then arises; what is rather the case is that the
world  as  world  is  disclosed  first  and  foremost  by  anxiety,  as  a  mode  of
state-of-mind. This does not signify, however, that in anxiety the worldhood
of the world gets conceptualized.

Anxiety is not only anxiety in the face of something, but, as a state-of-
mind, it is also anxiety about something. That which anxiety is profoundly
anxious [sich äbangstet] about is not a definite kind of Being for Dasein or a
definite possibility for it. Indeed the threat itself is indefinite, and therefore
cannot penetrate threateningly to this or that factically concrete potentiality-
for-Being. That which anxiety is anxious about is Being-in-the world itself.
In  anxiety  what  is  environmentally  ready-to-hand  sinks  away,  and  so,  in

general,  do  entities  within-the-world.  The  ‘world’  can  offer  nothing  more,
and  neither  can  the  Dasein-with  of  Others.  Anxiety  thus  takes  away  from
Dasein  the  possibility  of  understanding  itself,  as  it  falls,  in  terms  of  the
‘world’ and the way things have been publicly interpreted. Anxiety throws
Dasein back upon that which it is anxious about—its authentic potentiality-
for-Being-in-the-world.  Anxiety  individualizes  Dasein  for  its  ownmost
Being-in-the-world,  which  as  something  that  understands,  projects  itself
essentially upon possibilities. Therefore, with that which it is anxious about,
anxiety discloses Dasein as Being-possible, and indeed as the only kind of
thing  which  it  can  be  of  its  own  accord  as  something  individualized  in
individualization [vereinzeltes in der Vereinzelung].

H. 188

 

Anxiety  makes  manifest  in  Dasein  its  Being  towards  its  ownmost
potentiality-for-Being—that  is,  its  Being-free for  the  freedom  of  choosing
itself and taking hold of itself. Anxiety brings Dasein face to face with its
Being-free  for  (propensio  in...)  the  authenticity  of  its  Being,  and  for  this
authenticity as a possibility which it always is.(2) But at the same time, this
is the Being to which Dasein as Being-in-the-world has been delivered over.
 

1. ‘Allein dieses Nichts von Zuhandenem, das die alltägliche umsichtige Rede einzig versteht, ist

kein totales Nichts.’ This sentence is grammatically ambiguous.

2. ‘Die Angst bringt das Dasein vor sein Freisein für... (propensio in...) die Eigentlichkeit seines

Seins als Möglichkeit, die es immer schon ist.’

That about  which anxiety  is  anxious reveals itself as that in  the  face  of
which it is anxious—namely, Being-in-the-world. The selfsameness of that
in the face of which and that about which one has anxiety, extends even to
anxiousness  [Sichängsten]  itself.  For,  as  a  state-of-mind,  anxiousness  is  a
basic kind of Being-in-the-world. Here the disclosure and the disclosed are
existentially  selfsame  in  such  a  way  that  in  the  latter  the  world  has  been
disclosed  as  world,  and  Being-in  has  been  disclosed  as  a  potentiality-for-
Being  which  is  individualized,  pure,  and  thrown;  this  makes  it  plain  that
with  the  phenomenon  of  anxiety  a  distinctive  state-of-mind  has  become  a
theme for Interpretation. Anxiety individualizes Dasein and thus discloses it
as  ‘solus  ipse’.  But  this  existential  ‘solipsism’  is  so  far  from  the
displacement  of  putting  an  isolated  subject-Thing  into  the  innocuous

emptiness of a worldless occurring, that in an extreme sense what it does is
precisely  to  bring  Dasein  face  to  face  with  its  world  as  world,  and  thus
bring it face to face with itself as Being-in-the-world.

H. 189

 

 

Again  everyday  discourse  and  the  everyday  interpretation  of  Dasein
furnish our most unbiased evidence that anxiety as a basic state-of-mind is
disclosive in the manner we have shown. As we have said earlier, a state-of-
mind makes manifest ‘how one is’. In anxiety one feels ‘uncanny’.(1) Here
the  peculiar  indefiniteness  of  that  which  Dasein  finds  itself  alongside  in
anxiety,  comes  proximally  to  expression:  the  “nothing  and  nowhere”.  But
here  “uncanniness”  also  means  “not-being-at-home”  [das  Nicht-zuhause-
sein]. In our first indication of the phenomenal character of Dasein’s basic
state  and  in  our  clarification  of  the  existential  meaning  of  “Being-in”  as
distinguished from the categorial signification of ‘insideness’, Being-in was
defined  as  “residing  alongside...”,  “Being-familiar  with…”(ii)  This
character of Being-in was then brought to view more concretely through the
everyday publicness of the “they”, which brings tranquillized self-assurance
—‘Being-at-home’,  with 
average
everydayness  of  Dasein.(iii)  On  the  other  hand,  as  Dasein  falls,  anxiety
brings  it  back  from  its  absorption  in  the  ‘world’.  Everyday  familiarity
collapses.  Dasein  has  been  individualized,  but  individualized  as Being-in-
the-world. Being-in enters into the existential ‘mode’ of the “not-at-home”.
Nothing else is meant by our talk about ‘uncanniness’.

1.  ‘Befindlichkeit,  so  wurde  früher  gesagt,  macht  offenbar,  “wie  einem  ist”.  In  der  Angst  ist
einem  “unheimlich”.’  The  reference  is  presumably  to  H.  134  above.  While  ‘unheimlich’  is  here
translated as ‘uncanny’, it means more literally ‘unhomelike’, as the author proceeds to point out.

By this time we can see phenomenally what falling, as fleeing, flees in
the face of. It does not flee in the face of entities within-the-world; these are
precisely  what  it  flees  towards—as  entities  alongside  which  our  concern,
lost in the “they”, can dwell in tranquillized familiarity. When in falling we
flee  into  the  “at-home”  of  publicness,  we  flee  in  the  face  of  the  “not-at-

home”; that is, we flee in the face of the uncanniness which lies in Dasein—
in Dasein as thrown Being-in-the-world, which has been delivered over to
itself  in  its  Being.  This  uncanniness  pursues  Dasein  constantly,  and  is  a
threat  to  its  everyday  lostness  in  the  “they”,  though  not  explicitly.  This
threat  can  go  together  factically  with  complete  assurance  and  self-
sufficiency  in  one’s  everyday  concern.  Anxiety  can  arise  in  the  most
innocuous Situations. Nor does it have any need for darkness, in which it is
commonly easier for one to feel uncanny. In the dark there is emphatically
‘nothing’  to  see,  though  the  very  world  itself  is  still  ‘there’,  and  ‘there’
more obtrusively.

If  we  Interpret  Dasein’s  uncanniness  from  an  existential-ontological
point of view as a threat which reaches Dasein itself and which comes from
Dasein itself, we are not contending that in factical anxiety too it has always
been understood in this sense. When Dasein “understands” uncanniness in
the everyday manner, it does so by turning away from it in falling; in this
turning-away, the “not-at-home” gets ‘dimmed down’. Yet the everydayness
of  this  fleeing  shows  phenomenally  that  anxiety,  as  a  basic  state-of-mind,
belongs to Dasein’s essential state of Being-in-the-world, which, as one that
is  existential,  is  never  present-at-hand  but  is  itself  always  in  a  mode  of
factical  Being-there(1)—that is,  in  the  mode  of a state-of-mind.  That  kind
of  Being-in-the-world  which  is  tranquillized  and  familiar  is  a  mode  of
Dasein’s uncanniness, not the reverse. From an existential-ontological point
of  view,  the  “not-at-home”  must  be  conceived  as  the  more  primordial
phenomenon.
 

1.  Here  we  follow  the  earlier  editions  in  reading  ‘Da-seins’.  In  the  later  editions  the  hyphen

appears ambiguously at the end of a line.

And  only  because  anxiety  is  always  latent  in  Being-in-the-world,  can
such  Being-in-the-world,  as  Being  which  is  alongside  the  ‘world’  and
which  is  concernful  in  its  state-of-mind,  ever  be  afraid.  Fear  is  anxiety,
fallen into the ‘world’, inauthentic, and, as such, hidden from itself.

H. 190

 

After  all,  the  mood  of  uncanniness  remains,  factically,  something  for
which  we  mostly  have  no  existentiell  understanding.  Moreover,  under  the

ascendancy of falling and publicness, ‘real’ anxiety is rare. Anxiety is often
conditioned  by  ‘physiological’  factors.  This  fact,  in  its  facticity,  is  a
problem ontologically, not  merely  with  regard  to  its  ontical  causation  and
course of development. Only because Dasein is anxious in the very depths
of  its  Being,  does  it  become  possible  for  anxiety  to  be  elicited
physiologically.

Even  rarer  than  the  existentiell  Fact  of  “real”  anxiety  are  attempts  to
Interpret  this  phenomenon  according  to  the  principles  of  its  existential-
ontological Constitution and function. The reasons for this lie partly in the
general neglect of the existential analytic of Dasein, but more particularly in
a failure to recognize the phenomenon of state-of-mind(iv). Yet the factical
rarity  of  anxiety  as  a  phenomenon  cannot  deprive  it  of  its  fitness  to  take
over a methodological function in principle for the existential analytic. On
the  contrary,  the  rarity  of  the  phenomenon  is  an  index  that  Dasein,  which
for the most part remains concealed from itself in its authenticity because of
the  way  in  which  things  have  been  publicly  interpreted  by  the  “they”,
becomes disclosable in a primordial sense in this basic state-of-mind.
 

iv. It is no accident that the phenomena of anxiety and fear, which have never been distinguished
in a thoroughgoing manner, have come within the purview of Christian theology ontically and even
(though  within  very  narrow  limits)  ontologically.  This  has  happened  whenever  the  anthropological
problem  of  man’s  Being  towards  God  has  won  priority  and  when  questions  have  been  formulated
under the guidance of phenomena like faith, sin, love, and repentance. Cf. Augustine’s doctrine of the
timor  castus  and  servilis,  which  is  discussed  in  his  exegetical  writings  and  his  letters.  On  fear  in
general cf. his De diversis quaestionibus octoginta tribus, qu. 33 (de metu); qu. 34 (utrum non aliud
amandum sit, quam metu carere); qu. 35 (quid amandum sit). (Migne, Patrologiae Latinae tom. VII,
pp. 23 ff.)

Luther has treated the problem of fear not only in the traditional context of an Interpretation of
poenitentia  and  contritio,  but  also  in  his  commentary  on  the  Book  of  Genesis,  where,  though  his
treatment  is  by  no  means  highly  conceptualized,  it  is  all  the  more  impressive  as  edification.  Cf.
Enarrationes in genesin, cap. 3, Werke (Erlanger Ausgabe), Exegetica opera latina, tom. 1, pp. 177
ff.

The  man  who  has  gone  farthest  in  analysing  the  phenomenon  of  anxiety—and  again  in  the
theological  context  of  a  ‘psychological’  exposition  of  the  problem  of  original  sin—is  Søren
Kierkegaard.  Cf.  Der  Begriff  der  Angst  [The  Concept  of  Dread],  1844,  Gesammelte  Werke
(Diederichs), vol. 5.

Of course it is essential to every state-of-mind that in each case Being-
in-the-world  should  be  fully  disclosed  in  all  those  items  which  are
constitutive  for  it—world,  Being-in,  Self.  But  in  anxiety  there  lies  the

is  quite  distinctive;  for  anxiety
possibility  of  a  disclosure  which 
individualizes.  This  individualization  brings  Dasein  back  from  its  falling,
and makes manifest to it that authenticity and inauthenticity are possibilities
of its Being. These basic possibilities of Dasein (and Dasein is in each case
mine)  show  themselves  in  anxiety  as they  are  in  themselves—undisguised
by  entities  within-the-world,  to  which,  proximally  and  for  the  most  part,
Dasein clings.

How  far  has  this  existential  Interpretation  of  anxiety  arrived  at  a
phenomenal  basis  for  answering  the  guiding  question  of  the  Being  of  the
totality of Dasein’s structural whole?

41. Dasein’s Being as Care

 

Since  our  aim  is  to  grasp  the  totality  of  this  structural  whole
ontologically,  we  must  first  ask  whether  the  phenomenon  of  anxiety  and
that which is disclosed in it, can give us the whole of Dasein in a way which
is  phenomenally  equiprimordial,  and  whether  they  can  do  so  in  such  a
manner  that  if  we  look  searchingly  at  this  totality,  our  view  of  it  will  be
filled  in  by  what  has  thus  been  given  us.  The  entire  stock  of  what  lies
therein may be counted up formally and recorded: anxiousness as a state-of-
mind  is  a  way  of  Being-in-the-world;  that  in  the  face  of  which  we  have
anxiety is thrown Being-in-the-world; that which we have anxiety about is
our  potentiality-for-Being-in-the-world.  Thus  the  entire  phenomenon  of
anxiety  shows  Dasein  as  factically  existing  Being-in-the-world.  The
fundamental  ontological  characteristics  of  this  entity  are  existentiality,
facticity,  and  Being-fallen.  These  existential  characteristics  are  not  pieces
belonging  to  something  composite,  one  of  which  might  sometimes  be
missing;  but  there  is  woven  together  in  them  a  primordial  context  which
makes up that totality of the structural whole which we are seeking. In the
unity of those characteristics of Dasein’s Being which we have mentioned,
this Being becomes something which it is possible for us to grasp as such
ontologically. How is this unity itself to be characterized?

Dasein  is  an  entity  for  which,  in  its  Being,  that  Being  is  an  issue.  The
phrase  ‘is  an  issue’  has  been  made  plain  in  the  state-of-Being  of
understanding—of  understanding  as  self-projective  Being  towards  its
ownmost  potentiality-for-Being.  This  potentiality  is  that  for  the  sake  of

which  any  Dasein  is  as  it  is.  In  each  case  Dasein  has  already  compared
itself, in its Being, with a possibility of itself. Being-free for one’s ownmost
potentiality-for-Being, and therewith for the possibility of authenticity and
inauthenticity,  is  shown,  with  a  primordial,  elemental  concreteness,  in
anxiety.  But  ontologically,  Being  towards  one’s  ownmost  potentiality-for-
Being  means  that  in  each  case  Dasein  is  already  ahead  of  itself  [ihm
selbst… vorweg] in its Being. Dasein is always ‘beyond itself’ [“über sich
hinaus”], not as a way of behaving towards other entities which it is not, but
as Being towards the potentiality-for-Being which it is itself. This structure
of  Being,  which  belongs  to  the  essential  ‘is  an  issue’,  we  shall  denote  as
Dasein’s “Being-ahead-of-itself”.

H. 192

 

But this structure pertains to the whole of Dasein’s constitution. “Being-
ahead-of-itself”  does  not  signify  anything  like  an  isolated  tendency  in  a
worldless ‘subject’, but characterizes Being-in-the-world. To Being-in-the-
world, however, belongs the fact that it has been delivered over to itself—
that it has in each case already been thrown into a world. The abandonment
of  Dasein  to  itself  is  shown  with  primordial  concreteness  in  anxiety.
“Being-ahead-of-itself”  means,  if  we  grasp  it more  fully,  “ahead-of-itself-
in-already-being-in-a-world”. As soon as this essentially unitary structure is
seen  as  a  phenomenon,  what  we  have  set  forth  earlier  in  our  analysis  of
worldhood  also  becomes  plain.  The  upshot  of  that  analysis  was  that  the
referential  totality  of  significance  (which  as  such  is  constitutive  for
worldhood) has been ‘tied up’ with a “for-the-sake-of-which”. The fact that
this referential totality of the manifold relations of the ‘in-order-to’ has been
bound  up  with  that  which  is  an  issue  for  Dasein,  does  not  signify  that  a
‘world’ of Objects which is present-at-hand has been welded together with
a  subject.  It  is  rather  the  phenomenal  expression  of  the  fact  that  the
constitution  of  Dasein,  whose  totality  is  now  brought  out  explicitly  as
ahead-of-itself-in-Being-already-in…,  is  primordially  a  whole.  To  put  it
otherwise,  existing 
is  essentially
determined by facticity.

is  always  factical.  Existentiality 

Furthermore, Dasein’s factical existing is not only generally and without
further  differentiation  a  thrown  potentiality-for-Being-in-the-world;  it  is
always  also  absorbed  in  the  world  of  its  concern.  In  this  falling  Being-

alongside…,  fleeing  in  the  face  of  uncanniness  (which  for  the  most  part
remains  concealed  with  latent  anxiety,  since  the  publicness  of  the  “they”
suppresses  everything  unfamiliar),  announces  itself,  whether  it  does  so
explicitly or not, and whether it is understood or not. Ahead-of-itself-Being-
already-in-a-world  essentially  includes  one’s  falling  and  one’s  Being
alongside  those  things  ready-to-hand  within-the-world  with  which  one
concerns oneself.

The formally existential totality of Dasein’s ontological structural whole
must  therefore  be  grasped  in  the  following  structure:  the  Being  of  Dasein
means  ahead-of-itself-Being-already-in-(the-world)  as  Being-alongside
(entities encountered within-the-world). This Being fills in the signification
of the term “care” [Sorge], which is used in a purely ontologico-existential
manner. From this signification every tendency of Being which one might
have  in  mind  ontically,  such  as  worry  [Besorgnis]  or  carefreeness
[Sorglosigkeit], is ruled out.

H. 193

 

Because  Being-in-the-world  is  essentially  care,  Being-alongside  the
ready-to-hand  could  be  taken  in  our  previous  analyses  as  concern,  and
Being with the Dasein-with of Others as we encounter it within-the-world
could  be  taken  as  solicitude.(1)  Being-alongside  something  is  concern,
because it is defined as a way of Being-in by its basic structure—care. Care
does not characterize just existentiality, let us say, as detached from facticity
and  falling;  on  the  contrary,  it  embraces  the  unity  of  these  ways  in  which
Being  may  be  characterized.  So  neither  does  “care”  stand  primarily  and
exclusively for an isolated attitude of the “I” towards itself. If one were to
construct  the  expression  ‘care  for  oneself’  [“Selbst-sorge”],  following  the
analogy of “concern” [Besorgen] and “solicitude” [Fürsorge], this would be
a tautology. “Care” cannot stand for some special attitude towards the Self;
for the Self has already been characterized ontologically by “Being-ahead-
of-itself”,  a  characteristic  in  which  the  other  two  items  in  the  structure  of
care—Being-already-in…  and  Being-alongside…—have  been  posited  as
well [mitgesetzt].
 

1. Cf. H. 121 and 131 above.

In Being-ahead-of-oneself as Being towards one’s ownmost potentiality-
for-Being,  lies  the  existential-ontological  condition  for  the  possibility  of
Being-free  for  authentic  existentiell  possibilities.  For  the  sake  of  its
potentiality-for-Being, any Dasein is as it factically is. But to the extent that
this  Being  towards  its  potentiality-for-Being  is  itself  characterized  by
freedom,  Dasein  can  comport  itself  towards  its  possibilities,  even
unwillingly;  it  can  be  inauthentically;  and  factically  it  is  inauthentically,
proximally and for the most part. The authentic “for-the-sake-of-which” has
not  been  taken  hold  of;  the  projection  of  one’s  own  potentiality-for-Being
has been abandoned to the disposal of the “they”. Thus when we speak of
“Being-ahead-of-itself”, the ‘itself’ which we have in mind is in each case
the Self in the sense of the they-self. Even in inauthenticity Dasein remains
essentially ahead of itself, just as Dasein’s fleeing in the face of itself as it
falls,  still  shows  that  it  has  the  state-of-Being  of  an  entity  for  which  its
Being is an issue.

Care,  as  a  primordial  structural  totality,  lies  ‘before’  [“vor”]  every
factical  ‘attitude’  and  ‘situation’  of  Dasein,  and  it  does  so  existentially  a
priori; this  means  that  it  always  lies  in them.  So  this  phenomenon  by  no
means  expresses  a  priority  of  the  ‘practical’  attitude  over  the  theoretical.
When we ascertain something present-at-hand by merely beholding it, this
activity has the character of care just as much as does a ‘political action’ or
taking a rest and enjoying oneself. ‘Theory’ and ‘practice’ are possibilities
of Being for an entity whose Being must be defined as “care”.

H. 194

 

The  phenomenon  of  care  in  its  totality  is  essentially  something  that
cannot  be  torn  asunder;  so  any  attempts  to  trace  it  back  to  special  acts  or
drives like willing and wishing or urge and addiction,(1) or to construct it
out of these, will be unsuccessful.
 

1.  ‘…besondere  Akte  oder  Triebe  wie  Wollen  und  Wünschen  oder  Drang  und  Hang...’  Cf.  H.

182.

Willing  and  wishing  are  rooted  with  ontological  necessity  in  Dasein  as
care; they are not just ontologically undifferentiated Experiences occurring
in a ‘stream’ which is completely indefinite with regard to the meaning of

its  Being.  This  is  no  less  the  case  with  urge  and  addiction.  These  too  are
grounded in care so far as they can be exhibited in Dasein at all. This does
not prevent them from being ontologically constitutive even for entities that
merely ‘live’. But the basic ontological state of ‘living’ is a problem in its
own  right  and  can  be  tackled  only  reductively  and  privatively  in  terms  of
the ontology of Dasein.

Care  is  ontologically  ‘earlier’  than  the  phenomena  we  have  just
mentioned,  which  admittedly  can,  within  certain  limits,  always  be
‘described’  appropriately  without  our  needing  to  have  the  full  ontological
horizon visible, or even to be familiar with it at all. From the standpoint of
our present investigation in fundamental ontology, which aspires neither to
a  thematically  complete  ontology  of  Dasein  nor  even  to  a  concrete
anthropology, it must suffice to suggest how these phenomena are grounded
existentially in care.

That  very  potentiality-for-Being  for  the  sake  of  which  Dasein  is,  has
Being-in-the-world  as  its  kind  of  Being.  Thus  it  implies  ontologically  a
relation to entities within-the-world. Care is always concern and solicitude,
even if only privatively. In willing, an entity which is understood—that is,
one which has been projected upon its possibility—gets seized upon, either
as something with which one may concern oneself, or as something which
is  to  be  brought  into  its  Being  through  solicitude.  Hence,  to  any  willing
there  belongs  something  willed,  which  has  already  made  itself  definite  in
terms of a “for-the-sake-of-which”. If willing is to be possible ontologically,
the following items are constitutive for it: (1) the prior disclosedness of the
“for-the-sake-of-which” 
the
disclosedness of something with which one can concern oneself (the world
as  the  “wherein”  of  Being-already);(1)  (3)  Dasein’s  projection  of  itself
understandingly  upon  a  potentiality-for-Being  towards  a  possibility  of  the
entity ‘willed’. In the phenomenon of willing, the underlying totality of care
shows through.

H. 195

 

As something factical, Dasein’s projection of itself understandingly is in
each  case  already  alongside  a  world  that  has  been  discovered.  From  this

world  it  takes  its  possibilities,  and  it  does  so  first  in  accordance  with  the
way  things  have  been  interpreted  by  the  “they”.  This  interpretation  has
already  restricted  the  possible  options  of  choice  to  what  lies  within  the
range  of  the  familiar,  the  attainable,  the  respectable—that  which  is  fitting
and proper. This levelling off of Dasein’s possibilities to what is 
proximally  at  its everyday  disposal  also results  in  a dimming  down of the
possible as such. The average everydayness of concern becomes blind to its
possibilities, and tranquillizes itself with that which is merely ‘actual’. This
tranquillizing does not rule out a high degree of diligence in one’s concern,
but arouses it. In this case no positive new possibilities are willed, but that
which  is  at  one’s  disposal  becomes  ‘tactically’  altered  in  such  a  way  that
there is a semblance of something happening.

All  the  same,  this  tranquillized  ‘willing’  under  the  guidance  of  the
“they”,  does  not  signify  that  one’s  Being  towards  one’s  potentiality-for-
Being has been extinguished, but only that it has been modified. In such a
case,  one’s  Being  towards  possibilities  shows  itself  for  the  most  part  as
mere  wishing.  In  the  wish  Dasein  projects  its  Being  upon  possibilities
which  not  only  have  not  been  taken  hold  of  in  concern,  but  whose
fulfilment has not even been pondered over and expected. On the contrary,
in  the  mode  of  mere  wishing,  the  ascendancy  of  Being-ahead-of-oneself
brings with it a lack of understanding for the factical possibilities. When the
world has been primarily projected as a wish-world, Being-in-the-world has
lost itself inertly in what is at its disposal; but it has done so in such a way
that, in the light of what is wished for, that which is at its disposal (and this
is  all  that  is  ready-to-hand)  is  never  enough.  Wishing  is  an  existential
modification  of  projecting  oneself  understandingly,  when  such  self-
projection  has  fallen  forfeit  to  thrownness  and  just  keeps  hankering  after
possibilities.(1) Such hankering closes off the possibilities; what is ‘there’ in
wishful  hankering  turns  into  the  ‘actual  world’.  Ontologically,  wishing
presupposes care.

is 

In  hankering,  Being-already-alongside...  takes  priority.  The  “ahead-of-
itself-in-Being-already-in...” 
correspondingly  modified.  Dasein’s
hankering  as  it  falls  makes  manifest  its  addiction  to  becoming  ‘lived’  by
whatever world it is in. This addiction shows the character of Being out for
something [Ausseins auf...]. Being-ahead-of-oneself has lost itself in a ‘just-
always-already-alongside’.(2)  What  one  is  addicted  ‘towards’  [Das  “Hin-
zu” des Hanges) is to let oneself be drawn by the sort of thing for which the

addiction hankers. If Dasein, as it were, sinks into an addiction then there is
not merely an addiction present-at-hand, but the entire structure of care has
been modified. Dasein has become blind, and puts all possibilities into the
service of the addiction.

H. 196

 

On the other hand, the urge ‘to live’ is something ‘towards’ which one is
impelled, and it brings the impulsion along with it of its own accord.(3) It is
‘towards this at any price’. The urge seeks to crowd out [verdrängen] other
possibilities. Here too the Being-ahead-of-oneself is one that is inauthentic,
even if one is assailed by an urge coming from the very thing that is urging
one  on.  The  urge  can  outrun  one’s  current  state-of-mind  and  one’s
understanding.  But  then  Dasein  is  not—and  never  is—a  ‘mere  urge’  to
which other kinds of controlling or guiding behaviour are added from time
to time; rather, as a modification of the entirety of Being-in-the-world, it is
always care already.

In  pure  urge,  care  has  not  yet  become  free,  though  care  first  makes  it
ontologically possible for Dasein to be urged on by itself.(4) In addiction,
however, care has always been bound. Addiction and urge are possibilities
rooted  in  the  thrownness  of  Dasein.  The  urge  ‘to  live’  is  not  to  be
annihilated;  the  addiction  to  becoming  ‘lived’  by  the  world  is  not  to  be
rooted out. But because these are both grounded ontologically in care, and
only  because  of  this,  they  are  both  to  be  modified  in  an  ontical  and
existentiell manner by care—by care as something authentic.
 

1. ‘…das, der Geworfenheit verfallen, den Möglichkeiten lediglich noch nachhängt.’
2.  ‘…in  ein  “Nur-immer-schon-bei...”.’  Here  we  follow  the  reading  of  the  later  editions.  The

earlier editions have ‘ “Nur-immer-schon-sein-bei...”’ (‘just-always-Being-already-alongside’).

3.  ‘Dagegen  ist  der  Drang  “zu  leben”  ein  “Hin-zu”,  das  von  ihm  selbst  her  den  Antrieb

4. ‘…das Bedrängtsein des Daseins aus ihm selbst her...’

With  the  expression  ‘care’  we  have  in  mind  a  basic  existential-
ontological  phenomenon, which all the  same is not  simple in  its structure.
The  ontologically  elemental  totality  of  the  care-structure  cannot  be  traced
back  to  some  ontical  ‘primal  element’,  just  as  Being  certainly  cannot  be
‘explained’ in terms of entities. In the end it will be shown that the idea of

Being in general is just as far from being ‘simple’ as is the Being of Dasein.
In defining “care” as “Being-ahead-of-oneself—in-Being-already-in…—as
Being-alongside...”, we have made it plain that even this phenomenon is, in
itself,  still  structurally  articulated.  But  is  this  not  a  phenomenal  symptom
that  we  must  pursue  the  ontological  question  even  further  until  we  can
exhibit a still more primordial phenomenon which provides the ontological
support for the unity and the totality of the structural manifoldness of care?
Before we follow up this question, we must look back and appropriate with
greater  precision  what  we  have  hitherto  Interpreted  in  aiming  at  the
question  of  fundamental  ontology  as  to  the  meaning  of  Being  in  general.
First,  however,  we  must  show  that  what  is  ontologically  ‘new’  in  this
Interpretation  is  ontically  quite old.  In explicating Dasein’s Being  as care,
we  are  not  forcing  it  under  an  idea  of  our  own  contriving,  but  we  are
conceptualizing existentially what has already been disclosed in an ontico-
existentiell manner.

vorontologischen Selbstauslegung des Daseins.’

H. 197

 

In our foregoing Interpretations, which have finally led to exhibiting care
as  the  Being  of  Dasein,  everything  depended  on  our  arriving  at  the  right
ontological foundations for that entity which in each case we ourselves are,
and  which  we  call  ‘man’.  To  do  this  it  was  necessary  from  the  outset  to
change  the  direction  of  our  analysis  from  the  approach  presented  by  the
traditional  definition  of  “man”—an  approach  which  has  not  been  clarified
ontologically  and  is  in  principle  questionable.  In  comparison  with  this
definition,  the  existential-ontological  Interpretation  may  seem  strange,
especially  if  ‘care’  is  understood  just  ontically  as  ‘worry’  or  ‘grief’  [als
“Besorgnis”  und  “Bekümmernis”].  Accordingly  we  shall  now  cite  a
its
document  which 
demonstrative force is ‘merely historical’.

in  character,  even 

is  pre-ontological 

though 

We  must  bear  in  mind,  however,  that  in  this  document  Dasein  is
expressing itself ‘primordially’, unaffected by any theoretical Interpretation
and without aiming to propose any. We must also note that Dasein’s Being
is  characterized  by  historicality,  though  this  must  first  be  demonstrated
ontologically. If Dasein is ‘historical’ in the very depths of its Being, then a
deposition [Aussage] which comes from its history and goes back to it, and
which,  moreover,  is prior  to  any  scientific  knowledge,  will  have  especial
weight,  even  though  its  importance  is  never  purely  ontological.  That
understanding  of  Being  which  lies  in  Dasein  itself,  expresses  itself  pre-
ontologically. The document which we are about to cite should make plain
that  our  existential  Interpretation  is  not  a  mere  fabrication,  but  that  as  an
ontological  ‘construction’  it  is  well  grounded  and  has  been  sketched  out
beforehand in elemental ways.

There  is  an  ancient  fable  in  which  Dasein’s  interpretation  of  itself  as

‘care’ has been embedded:(v)
 

v.  The  author  ran  across  the  following  pre-ontological  illustration  of  the  existential-ontological
Interpretation  of  Dasein  as  care  in  K.  Burdach’s  article.  ‘Faust  und  die  Sorge’  (Deutsche
Vierteljahrschrift  für  Literaturwissenschaft  und  Geistesgeschichte, vol.  I,  1923,  pp.  1  ff.).  Burdach
has shown that the fable of Cura (which has come down to us as No. 220 of the Fables of Hyginus)
was taken over from Herder by Goethe and worked up for the second part of his Faust. Cf. especially
pp. 40 ff. The text given above is taken from F. Bücheler (Rheinisches Museum, vol. 41, 1886, p. 5);
the translation is from Burdach, ibid., pp. 41 ff.

H. 198

 

Cura cum fluvium transiret, vidit cretosum lutum
sustulitque cogitabunda atque coepit fingere.
dum deliberat quid iam fecisset, Jovis intervenit.
rogat eum Cura ut det illi spiritum, et facile impetrat.
cui cum vellet Cura nomen ex sese ipsa imponere,
Jovis prohibuit suumque nomen ei dandum esse dictitat.
dum Cura et Jovis disceptant, Tellus surrexit simul
suumque nomen esse volt cui corpus praebuerit suum.
sumpserunt Saturnum iudicem, is sic aecus iudicat:
‘tu Jovis quia spiritum dedisti, in morte spiritum,
tuque Tellus, quia dedisti corpus, corpus recipito,
Cura eum quia prima finxit, teneat quamdiu vixerit.
sed quae nunc de nomine eius vobis controversia est,

homo vocetur, quia videtur esse factus ex humo.’

‘Once  when  ‘Care’  was  crossing  a  river,  she  saw  some  clay;  she
thoughtfully  took  up  a  piece  and  began  to  shape  it.  While  she  was
meditating  on  what  she  had  made,  Jupiter  came  by.  ‘Care’  asked  him  to
give it spirit, and this he gladly granted. But when she wanted her name to
be  bestowed  upon  it,  he  forbade  this,  and  demanded  that  it  be  given  his
name  instead.  While  ‘Care’  and  Jupiter  were  disputing,  Earth  arose  and
desired  that  her  own  name  be  conferred  on  the  creature,  since  she  had
furnished it with part of her body. They asked Saturn to be their arbiter, and
he  made  the  following  decision,  which  seemed  a  just  one:  ‘Since  you,
Jupiter,  have  given  its  spirit,  you  shall  receive  that  spirit  at  its  death;  and
since you, Earth, have given its body, you shall receive its body. But since
‘Care’ first shaped this creature, she shall possess it as long as it lives. And
because  there  is  now  a  dispute  among  you  as  to  its  name,  let  it  be  called
‘homo’, for it is made out of humus (earth).’(1)
 

1. In both the earlier and later editions Heidegger has ‘videt’ in the first line of the Latin version
of  the  fable,  where  Bücheler,  from  whom  the  text  has  been  taken,  has  ‘vidit’;  in  the  12th  line
Heidegger has ‘enim’ where Bücheler has ‘eum’. The punctuation of the Latin version is as Bücheler
gives  it.  The  single  quotation  marks  in  the  English  translation  correspond  strictly  to  the  double
quotation marks in Heidegger’s version; some of these are not found in Burdach’s translation, which,
except  for  two  entirely  trivial  changes,  Heidegger  has  otherwise  reproduced  very  accurately.  (On
Bücheler  and  Burdach,  see  Heidegger’s  note  v,  ad  loc.)  Our  translation  is  a  compromise  between
Burdach and the original Latin.

This  pre-ontological  document  becomes  especially  significant  not  only
in  that  ‘care’  is  here  seen  as  that  to  which  human  Dasein  belongs  ‘for  its
lifetime’, but also because this priority of ‘care’ emerges in connection with
the familiar way of taking man as compounded of body (earth) and spirit.
“Cura prima finxit”: in care this entity has the ‘source’ of its Being. “Cura
teneat,  quamdiu vixerit”; the  entity  is  not  released  from  this  source  but  is
held fast, dominated by it through and through as long as this entity ‘is in
the  world’.  ‘Being-in-the-world’  has  the  stamp  of  ‘care’,  which  accords
with its Being. It gets the name “homo” not in consideration of its Being but
in relation to that of which it consists (humus). The decision as to wherein
the  ‘primordial’  Being  of  this  creature  is  to  be  seen,  is  left  to  Saturn,
‘Time’.(vi)  Thus  the  pre-ontological  characterization  of  man’s  essence
expressed  in  this  fable,  has  brought  to  view  in  advance  the  kind  of  Being

which  dominates  his  temporal  sojourn  in  the  world,  and  does  so  through
and through.

H. 199

 

The history of the signification of the ontical concept of ‘care’ permits us
to see still further basic structures of Dasein. Burdach(vii) calls attention to
a double meaning of the term ‘cura’ according to which it signifies not only
‘anxious  exertion’  but  also  ‘carefulness’  and  ‘devotedness’  [“Sorgfalt”,
“Hingabe”].  Thus  Seneca  writes  in  his  last  epistle  (Ep. 124):  ‘Among  the
four  existent  Natures  (trees,  beasts,  man,  and  God),  the  latter  two,  which
alone  are  endowed  with  reason,  are  distinguished  in  that  God  is  immortal
while  man  is  mortal.  Now  when  it  comes  to  these,  the  good  of  the  one,
namely God, is fulfilled by his Nature; but that of the other, man, is fulfilled
by  care  (cura):  “unius  bonum  natura  perficit,  dei  scilicet,  alterius  cura,
hominis.”

Man’s perfectio—his transformation into that which he can be in Being-
free for his ownmost possibilities (projection)—is ‘accomplished’ by ‘care’.
But with equal primordiality ‘care’ determines what is basically specific in
this  entity,  according  to  which  it  has  been  surrendered  to  the  world  of  its
concern (thrownness). In the ‘double meaning’ of ‘care’, what we have in
view  is  a  single  basic  state  in  its  essentially  twofold  structure  of  thrown
projection.

As  compared  with  this  ontical  interpretation,  the  existential-ontological
Interpretation  is  not,  let  us  say,  merely  an  ontical  generalization  which  is
theoretical in character. That would just mean that ontically all man’s ways
of  behaving  are  ‘full  of  care’  and  are  guided  by  his  ‘devotedness’  to
something. The ‘generalization’ is rather one that is ontological and  a  p r i
o r i. What it has in view is not a set of ontical properties which constantly
keep  emerging,  but  a  state  of  Being  which  is  already  underlying  in  every
case,  and  which  first  makes  it  ontologically  possible  for  this  entity  to  be
addressed ontically  as “cura”. The  existential  condition  for  the  possibility
of  ‘the  cares  of  life’  and  ‘devotedness’,  must  be  conceived  as  care,  in  a
sense which is primordial—that is ontological.
 

vii. Burdach, op. cit., p. 49. Even as early as the Stoics, μέριμνα was a firmly established term,
and it recurs in the New Testament, becoming “sollicitudo” in the Vulgate. The way in which ‘care’
is viewed in the foregoing existential analytic of Dasein, is one which has grown upon the author in
connection with his attempts to Interpret the Augustinian (i.e., Helleno-Christian) anthropology with
regard to the foundational principles reached in the ontology of Aristotle.

H. 200

 

The  transcendental  ‘generality’  of  the  phenomenon  of  care  and  of  all
fundamental existentialia is,  on  the  other  hand,  broad  enough  to  present  a
basis on which every interpretation of Dasein which is ontical and belongs
to  a  world-view  must  move,  whether  Dasein  is  understood  as  affliction
[Not] and the ‘cares of life’ or in an opposite manner.

The  very  ‘emptiness’  and  ‘generality’  which  obtrude  themselves
ontically  in  existential  structures,  have  an  ontological  definiteness  and
fulness of their own. Thus Dasein’s whole constitution itself is not simple in
its unity, but shows a structural articulation; in the existential conception of
care, this articulation becomes expressed.

Thus, by our ontological Interpretation of Dasein, we have been brought
to  the  existential  conception  of  care  from  Dasein’s  pre-ontological
interpretation of itself as ‘care’. Yet the analytic of Dasein is not aimed at
laying  an  ontological  basis  for  anthropology;  its  purpose  is  one  of
fundamental  ontology.  This  is  the  purpose  that  has  tacitly  determined  the
course of our considerations hitherto, our selection of phenomena, and the
limits to which our analysis may proceed. Now, however, with regard to our
leading question of the meaning of Being and our way of working this out,
our investigation must give us explicit assurance as to what we have so far
achieved. But this sort of thing is not to be reached by superficially taking
together  what  we  have  discussed.  Rather,  with  the  help  of  what  we  have
achieved, that which could be indicated only crudely at the beginning of the
existential  analytic,  must  now  be  concentrated  into  a  more  penetrating
understanding of the problem.

43. Dasein, Worldhood, and Reality

 

The  question  of  the  meaning  of  Being  becomes  possible  at  all  only  if
there is something like an understanding of Being. Understanding of Being

belongs  to  the  kind  of  Being  which  the  entity  called  “Dasein”  possesses.
The more appropriately and primordially we have succeeded in explicating
this  entity,  the  surer  we  are  to  attain  our  goal  in  the  further  course  of
working out the problem of fundamental ontology.

H. 201

 

In our pursuit of the tasks of a preparatory existential analytic of Dasein,
Interpretation  of  understanding,  meaning,  and
there  emerged  an 
interpretation.  Our  analysis  of  Dasein’s  disclosedness  showed  further  that,
with this disclosedness, Dasein, in its basic state of Being-in-the-world, has
been revealed equiprimordially with regard to the world, Being-in, and the
Self. Furthermore, in the factical disclosedness of the world, entities within-
the-world are discovered too. This implies that the Being of these entities is
always understood in a certain manner, even if it is not conceived in a way
which  is  appropriately  ontological.  To  be  sure,  the  pre-ontological
understanding of Being embraces all entities which are essentially disclosed
in Dasein; but the understanding of Being has not yet Articulated itself in a
way which corresponds to the various modes of Being.

At the same time our interpretation of understanding has shown that, in
accordance  with  its  falling  kind  of  Being,  it  has,  proximally  and  for  the
most  part,  diverted  itself  [sich...  verlegt]  into  an  understanding  of  the
‘world’. Even where the issue is not only one of ontical experience but also
one  of  ontological  understanding,  the  interpretation  of  Being  takes  its
orientation in the first instance from the Being of entities within-the-world.
Thereby  the  Being  of  what  is  proximally  ready-to-hand  gets  passed  over,
and  entities  are  first  conceived  as  a  context  of  Things  (res)  which  are
present-at-hand.  “Being”  acquires 
the  meaning  of  “Reality”.(viii)
Substantiality becomes the basic characteristic of Being. Corresponding to
this way  in  which the  understanding  of Being  has been diverted,  even the
ontological  understanding  of  Dasein  moves  into  the  horizon  of  this
conception of Being. Like any other entity, Dasein too is present-at-hand as
Real.  In  this  way  “Being  in  general”  acquires  the  meaning  of  “Reality”.
Accordingly the concept of Reality has a peculiar priority in the ontological
problematic.  By  this  priority  the  route  to  a  genuine  existential  analytic  of
Dasein gets diverted, and so too does our very view of the Being of what is
proximally  ready-to-hand  within-the-world.  It  finally  forces  the  general

problematic  of  Being  into  a  direction  that  lies  off  the  course.  The  other
modes of Being  become defined negatively and privatively with  regard  to
Reality.

Thus not only the analytic of Dasein but the working-out of the question
of the meaning of Being in general must be turned away from a one-sided
orientation  with  regard  to  Being  in  the  sense  of  Reality.  We  must
demonstrate  that  Reality  is  not  only  one  kind  of  Being  among  others,  but
that  ontologically  it  has  a  definite  connection  in  its  foundations  with
Dasein,  the  world,  and  readiness-to-hand.  To  demonstrate  this  we  must
discuss in principle the problem of Reality, its conditions and its limits.
 

viii. Cf. H. 89 ff. and H. 100.

H. 202

 

Under the heading ‘problem of Reality’ various questions are clustered:
(1)  whether  any  entities  which  supposedly  ‘transcend  our  consciousness’
are at all; (2) whether this Reality of the ‘external world’ can be adequately
proved; (3) how far this entity, if it is Real, is to be known in its Being-in-
itself; (4) what the meaning of this entity, Reality, signifies in general. The
following  discussion  of the  problem  of Reality will treat  three topics  with
regard to the question of fundamental ontology: (a) Reality as a problem of
Being,  and  whether  the  ‘external  world’  can  be  proved;  (b) Reality  as  an
ontological problem; (c) Reality and care.

(a) Reality as a problem of Being, and whether the ‘External World’

can be Proved
 

Of  these  questions  about  Reality,  the  one  which  comes  first  in  order  is
the ontological question of what “Reality” signifies in general. But as long
as  a  pure  ontological  problematic  and  methodology  was  lacking,  this
question (if it was explicitly formulated at all) was necessarily confounded
with a discussion of the ‘problem of the external world’; for the analysis of
Reality is possible only on the basis of our having appropriate access to the
Real. But it has long been held that the way to grasp the Real is by that kind
of  knowing  which  is  characterized  by  beholding  [das  anschauende

in  which 

the  soul—or
Erkennen].  Such  knowing  ‘is’  as  a  way 
consciousness—behaves. In so far as Reality has the character of something
independent  and  “in  itself”,  the  question  of  the  meaning  of  “Reality”
becomes  linked  with  that  of  whether  the  Real  can  be  independent  ‘of
consciousness’  or  whether  there  can  be  a  transcendence  of  consciousness
into  the  ‘sphere’  of  the  Real.  The  possibility  of  an  adequate  ontological
analysis  of  Reality  depends  upon  how  far  that  of  which  the  Real  is  to  be
thus  independent—how  far  that  which  is  to  be  transcended(1)—has  itself
been clarified with regard to its Being. Only thus can even the kind of Being
which  belongs  to  transcendence  be  ontologically  grasped.  And  finally  we
must  make  sure  what  kind  of  primary  access  we  have  to  the  Real,  by
deciding the question of whether knowing can take over this function at all.
 

1. ‘…das, wovon Unabhängigkeit bestehen soll, was transzendiert werden soll…’

These 

investigations,  which 

take  precedence  over  any  possible
ontological  question  about  Reality,  have  been  carried  out  in  the  foregoing
existential analytic. According to this analytic, knowing is a founded mode
of  access  to  the  Real.  The  Real  is  essentially  accessible  only  as  entities
within-the-world. All access to such entities is founded ontologically upon
the basic state of Dasein, Being-in-the-world; and this in turn has care as its
even  more  primordial  state  of  Being  (ahead  of  itself—Being  already  in  a
world—as Being alongside entities within-the-world).

H. 203

 

The question of whether there is a world at all and whether its Being can
be proved, makes no sense if it is raised by Dasein  as Being-in-the-world;
and who else would raise it? Furthermore, it is encumbered with a double
signification. The world as the “wherein” [das Worin] of Being-in, and the
‘world’  as  entities  within-the-world  (that  in  which  [das  Wobei]  one  is
concernfully  absorbed)  either  have  been  confused  or  are  not  distinguished
at all. But the world is disclosed essentially along with the Being of Dasein;
with  the  disclosedness  of  the  world,  the  ‘world’  has  in  each  case  been
discovered too. Of course entities within-the-world in the sense of the Real
as  merely  present-at-hand,  are  the  very  things  that  can  remain  concealed.
But even the Real can be discovered only on the basis of a world which has

already  been  disclosed.  And  only  on  this  basis  can  anything  Real  still
remain hidden.  The  question  of  the  ‘Reality’  of  the  ‘external  world’  gets
raised without any previous clarification of the phenomenon of the world as
such. Factically, the ‘problem of the external world’ is  constantly oriented
with  regard  to  entities  within-the-world  (Things  and  Objects).  So  these
discussions drift along into a problematic which it is almost impossible to
disentangle ontologically.

Kant’s ‘Refutation of Idealism’(ix) shows how intricate these questions
are  and  how  what  one  wants  to  prove  gets  muddled  with  what  one  does
prove and with the means whereby the proof is carried out. Kant calls it ‘a
scandal of philosophy and of human reason in general’(x) that there is still
no cogent proof for the ‘Dasein of Things outside of us’ which will do away
with any scepticism. He proposes such a proof himself, and indeed he does
so to provide grounds for his ‘theorem’ that ‘The mere consciousness of my
own Dasein—a consciousness which, however, is empirical in character—
proves the Dasein of objects in the space outside of me.”(xi)

We  must  in  the  first  instance  note  explicitly  that  Kant  uses  the  term
‘Dasein’ to designate that kind of Being which in the present investigation
we  have  called  ‘presence-at-hand’.  ‘Consciousness  of  my  Dasein’  means
for  Kant  a  consciousness  of  my  Being-present-at-hand  in  the  sense  of
Descartes.  When  Kant  uses  the  term  ‘Dasein’  he  has  in  mind  the  Being-
present-at-hand of consciousness just as much as the Being-present-at-hand
of Things.

The proof for the ‘Dasein of Things outside of me’ is supported by the
fact that both change and performance belong, with equal primordiality, to
the  essence  of  time.  My  own  Being-present-at-hand—that  is,  the  Being-
present-at-hand of a multiplicity of representations, which has been given in
the inner sense—is a process of change which is present-at-hand. To have a
determinate  temporal  character  [Zeitbestimmtheit],  however,  presupposes

something present-at-hand which is permanent. But this cannot be ‘in us’,
‘for  only  through  what  is  thus  permanent  can  my  Dasein  in  time  be
determined’.(xii)  Thus  if  changes  which  are  present-at-hand  have  been
posited empirically ‘in me’, it is necessary that along with these something
permanent which is present-at-hand should be posited empirically ‘outside
of me’. What is thus permanent is the condition which makes it possible for
the changes ‘in me’ to be present-at-hand. The experience of the Being-in-
time  of  representations  posits  something  changing  ‘in  me’  and  something
permanent ‘outside of me’, and it posits both with equal primordiality.

Of  course  this  proof  is  not  a  causal  inference  and  is  therefore  not
encumbered with the disadvantages which that would imply. Kant gives, as
it were, an ‘ontological proof’ in terms of the idea of a temporal entity. It
seems at first as if Kant has given up the Cartesian approach of positing a
subject one can come across in isolation. But only in semblance. That Kant
demands  any  proof  at  all  for  the  ‘Dasein  of  Things  outside  of  me’  shows
already that he takes the subject—the ‘in me’—as the starting-point for this
problematic.  Moreover,  his  proof  itself  is  then  carried  through  by  starting
with  the  empirically  given  changes  ‘in  me’.  For  only  ‘in  me’  is  ‘time’
experienced,  and  time  carries  the  burden  of  the  proof.  Time  provides  the
basis for leaping off into what is ‘outside of me’ in the course of the proof.
Furthermore, Kant emphasizes that “The problematical kind  [of  idealism],
which  merely  alleges  our  inability  to  prove  by  immediate  experience  that
there is a Dasein outside of our own, is reasonable and accords with a sound
kind of philosophical thinking: namely, to permit no decisive judgment until
an adequate proof has been found.”(xiii)

But  even  if  the  ontical  priority  of  the  isolated  subject  and  inner
experience  should  be given  up, Descartes’ position  would  still  be retained
ontologically.  What  Kant  proves—if  we  may  suppose  that  his  proof  is
correct and correctly based—is that entities which are changing and entities
which  are  permanent  are  necessarily  present-at-hand  together.  But  when
two  things  which  are  present-at-hand  are  thus  put  on  the  same  level,  this
does not  as yet  mean that subject  and Object  are  present-at-hand  together.
And even if this were proved, what is ontologically decisive would still be
covered  up—namely,  the  basic  state  of  the  ‘subject’,  Dasein,  as  Being-in-
the-world.  The  Being-Present-at-hand-together  of  the  physical  and  the
psychical  is  completely  different  ontically  and  ontologically  from  the
phenomenon of Being-in-the-world.

Kant  presupposes  both  the  distinction  between  the  ‘in  me’  and  the
‘outside  of  me’,  and  also  the  connection  between  these;  factically  he  is
correct in doing so, but he is incorrect from the standpoint of the tendency
of his proof. It has not been demonstrated that the sort of thing which gets
established  about  the  Being-present-at-hand-together  of  the  changing  and
the  permanent  when  one  takes  time  as  one’s  clue,  will  also  apply  to  the
connection between the ‘in me’ and the ‘outside of me’. But if one were to
see  the  whole  distinction  between  the  ‘inside’  and  the  ‘outside’  and  the
whole connection between them which Kant’s proof presupposes, and if one
were  to  have  an  ontological  conception  of  what  has  been  presupposed  in
this  presupposition,  then  the  possibility  of  holding  that  a  proof  of  the
‘Dasein  of  Things  outside  of  me’  is  a  necessary  one  which  has  yet  to  be
given [noch ausstehend], would collapse.

The ‘scandal of philosophy’ is not that this proof has yet to be given, but
that  such  proofs  are  expected  and  attempted  again  and  again.  Such
expectations,  aims,  and  demands  arise  from  an  ontologically  inadequate
way of starting with something of such a character that independently of  it
and ‘outside’ of it a ‘world’ is to be proved as present-at-hand. It is not that
the  proofs  are  inadequate,  but  that  the  kind  of  Being  of  the  entity  which
does the proving and makes requests for proofs has not been made definite
enough. This is why a demonstration that two things which are present-at-
hand  are  necessarily  present-at-hand  together,  can  give  rise  to  the  illusion
that  something  has  been  proved,  or  even  can  be  proved,  about  Dasein  as
Being-in-the-world. If Dasein is understood correctly, it defies such proofs,
because, in its Being, it already is what subsequent proofs deem necessary
to demonstrate for it.

If  one  were  to  conclude  that  since  the  Being-present-at-hand  of  Things
outside of us is impossible to prove, it must therefore ‘be taken merely on
faith’(xiv) one would still fail to surmount this perversion of the problem.
The  assumption  would  remain  that  at  bottom  and  ideally  it  must  still  be
possible  to  carry  out  such  a  proof.  This  inappropriate  way  of  approaching

the  problem  is  still  endorsed  when  one  restricts  oneself  to  a  ‘faith  in  the
Reality  of  the  external  world’,  even  if  such  a  faith  is  explicitly
‘acknowledged’ as such. Although one is not offering a stringent proof, one
is still in principle demanding a proof and trying to satisfy that demand.

must make its way from the facts of consciousness rather than from external actuality.’ (Ibid., p. 90.)

H. 206

 

Even if one should invoke the doctrine that the subject must presuppose
and indeed always does unconsciously presuppose the presence-at-hand of
the  ‘external  world’,  one  would  still  be  starting  with  the  construct  of  an
isolated subject. The phenomenon of Being-in-the-world is something that
one would no more meet in this way than one would by demonstrating that
the  physical  and  the  psychical  are  present-at-hand  together.  With  such
presuppositions, Dasein always comes ‘too late’; for in so far as it does this
presupposing as an entity (and otherwise this would be impossible), it is, as
an  entity,  already  in  a  world.  ‘Earlier’  than  any  presupposition  which
Dasein makes, or any of its ways of behaving, is the ‘a priori’ character of
its state of Being as one whose kind of Being is care.

To have faith  in  the  Reality  of  the  ‘external  world’,  whether  rightly  or
wrongly; to “prove” this Reality for it, whether adequately or inadequately;
to presuppose  it,  whether  explicitly  or  not—attempts  such  as  these  which
have  not  mastered  their  own  basis  with  full  transparency,  presuppose  a
subject  which  is  proximally  worldless  or  unsure  of  its  world,  and  which
must, at bottom, first assure itself of a world. Thus from the very beginning,
Being-in-a-world is disposed to “take things” in some way [Auffassen], to
suppose,  to  be  certain,  to  have  faith—a  way  of  behaving  which  itself  is
always a founded mode of Being-in-the-world.

The ‘problem of Reality’ in the sense of the question whether an external
world is present-at-hand and whether such a world can be proved, turns out
to be an impossible one, not because its consequences lead to inextricable
impasses,  but  because  the  very  entity  which  serves  as  its  theme,  is  one
which, as it were, repudiates any such formulation of the question. Our task

is not to prove that an ‘external world’ is present-at-hand or to show how it
is present-at-hand, but to point out why Dasein, as Being-in-the-world, has
the  tendency  to  bury  the  ‘external  world’  in  nullity  ‘epistemologically’
before  going  on  to  prove  it.(1)  The  reason  for  this  lies  in  Dasein’s  falling
and  in  the  way  in  which  the  primary  understanding  of  Being  has  been
diverted  to  Being  as presence-at-hand—a diversion  which is  motivated  by
that  falling  itself.  If  one  formulates  the  question  ‘critically’  with  such  an
ontological  orientation,  then  what  one  finds  present-at-hand  as  proximally
and  solely  certain,  is  something  merely  ‘inner’.  After  the  primordial
phenomenon of Being-in-the-world has been shattered, the isolated subject
is  all  that  remains,  and  this  becomes  the  basis  on  which  it  gets  joined
together with a ‘world’.

In  this  investigation  we  cannot  discuss  at  length  the  many  attempts  to
solve the ‘problem of Reality’ which have been developed in various kinds
of  realism  and  idealism  and  in  positions  which  mediate  between  them.
Certainly  a  grain  of  genuine  inquiry  is  to  be  found  in  each  of  these;  but
certain as this is, it would be just as perverse if one should want to achieve a
tenable solution of the problem by reckoning up how much has been correct
in  each  case.  What  is  needed  rather  is  the  basic  insight  that  while  the
different epistemological directions which have been pursued have not gone
so very far off epistemologically, their neglect of any existential analytic of
Dasein  has  kept  them  from  obtaining  any  basis  for  a  well  secured
phenomenal  problematic.  Nor  is  such  a  basis  to  be  obtained  by
subsequently  making  phenomenological  corrections  on  the  concepts  of
subject and consciousness. Such a procedure would give no guarantee that
the inappropriate formulation of the question would not continue to stand.

Along with Dasein as Being-in-the-world, entities within-the-world have
in  each  case  already  been  disclosed.  This  existential-ontological  assertion
seems to accord with the thesis of realism that the external world is Really
present-at-hand.  In  so  far  as  this  existential  assertion  does  not  deny  that
entities within-the-world are present-at-hand, it agrees—doxographically, as

it were—with the thesis of realism in its results. But it differs in principle
from every kind of realism; for realism holds that the Reality of the ‘world’
not only needs to be proved but also is capable of proof. In the existential
these  positions  are  directly  negated.  But  what
assertion  both  of 
distinguishes  this  assertion  from  realism  altogether,  is  the  fact  that  in
realism there is a lack of ontological understanding. Indeed realism tries to
explain Reality ontically by Real connections of interaction between things
that are Real.

As  compared  with  realism,  idealism,  no  matter  how  contrary  and
untenable  it  may  be  in  its  results,  has  an  advantage  in  principle,  provided
that it does not misunderstand itself as ‘psychological’ idealism. If idealism
emphasizes  that  Being  and  Reality  are  only  ‘in  the  consciousness’,  this
expresses  an  understanding  of  the  fact  that  Being  cannot  be  explained
through  entities.  But  as  long  as  idealism  fails  to  clarify  what  this  very
understanding  of  Being  means  ontologically,  or  how  this  understanding  is
possible, or that it belongs to Dasein’s state of Being, the Interpretation of
Reality which idealism constructs is an empty one. Yet the fact that Being
cannot be explained through entities and that Reality is possible only in the
understanding of Being, does not absolve us from inquiring into the Being
of  consciousness,  of  the  res  cogitans  itself.  If  the  idealist  thesis  is  to  be
followed  consistently,  the  ontological  analysis  of  consciousness  itself  is
prescribed  as  an  inevitable  prior  task.  Only  because  Being  is  ‘in  the
consciousness’—that is to say, only because it is understandable in Dasein
—can  Dasein  also  understand  and  conceptualize  such  characteristics  of
Being as independence, the ‘in-itself’, and Reality in general. Only because
of  this  are  ‘independent’  entities,  as  encountered  within-the-world,
accessible to circumspection.

H. 208

 

If  what  the  term  “idealism”  says,  amounts  to  the  understanding  that
Being  can  never  be  explained  by  entities  but  is  already  that  which  is
‘transcendental’  for  every  entity,  then  idealism  affords  the  only  correct
possibility  for  a  philosophical  problematic.  If  so,  Aristotle  was  no  less  an
idealist than Kant. But if “idealism” signifies tracing back every entity to a
subject  or  consciousness  whose  sole  distinguishing  features  are  that  it
remains indefinite in  its Being  and is  best characterized negatively as ‘un-

Thing-like’, then this idealism is no less naïve in its method than the most
grossly militant realism.

It is still possible that one may give the problematic of Reality priority
over any orientation in terms of ‘standpoints’ by maintaining the thesis that
every  subject  is  what  it  is  only  for  an  Object,  and  vice versa.  But  in  this
formal  approach  the  terms  thus  correlated—like  the  correlation  itself—
remain  ontologically  indefinite.  At  the  bottom,  however,  the  whole
correlation  necessarily  gets  thought  of  as  ‘somehow’  being,  and  must
therefore  be  thought  of  with  regard  to  some  definite  idea  of  Being.  Of
course, if the existential-ontological basis has been made secure beforehand
by  exhibiting  Being-in-the-world,  then  this  correlation  is  one  that  we  can
know later as a formalized relation, ontologically undifferentiated.

Our  discussion  of  the  unexpressed  presuppositions  of  attempts  to  solve
the problem of Reality in ways which are just ‘epistemological’, shows that
this problem must be taken back, as an ontological one, into the existential
analytic of Dasein.(xvi)
 

xvi.  Following  Scheler’s  procedure,  Nicolai  Hartmann  has  recently  based  his  ontologically
oriented epistemology upon the thesis that knowing is a ‘relationship of Being’. Cf. his Grundzüge
einer  Metaphysik  der  Erkenntnis,  second  enlarged  edition,  1925.  Both  Scheler  and  Hartmann,
however, in spite of all the differences in the phenomenological bases from which they start, fail to
recognize that in its traditional basic orientation as regards Dasein, ‘ontology’ has been a failure, and
that  the  very  ‘relationship  of  Being’  which  knowing  includes  (see  above,  H.  59  ff.),  compels  such
‘ontology’  to  be  revised  in  its  principles,  not  just  critically  corrected.  Because  Hartmann
underestimates the unexpressed consequences of positing a relationship-of-Being without providing
an ontological clarification for it, he is forced into a ‘critical realism’ which is at bottom quite foreign
to  the  level  of  the  problematic  he  has  expounded.  On  Hartmann’s  way  of  taking  ontology,  cf.  his
‘Wie ist kritische Ontologie überhaupt möglich?‘, Festschrift für Paul Natorp, 1924, pp. 124 ff.

(b) Reality as an Ontological Problem

 

 

H. 209

If the term “Reality” is meant to stand for the Being of entities present-
at-hand  within-the-world  (res)  (and  nothing  else  is  understood  thereby),
then  when  it  comes  to  analysing  this  mode  of  Being,  this  signifies  that
the
entities  within-the-world  are  ontologically  conceivable  only 
phenomenon  of  within-the-world-ness  has  been  clarified.  But  within-the-
world-ness is based upon the phenomenon of the world, which, for its part,

if 

To  be  sure, 

as  an  essential  item  in  the  structure  of  Being-in-the-world,  belongs  to  the
basic  constitution  of  Dasein.  Being-in-the-world,  in  turn,  is  bound  up
ontologically  in  the  structural  totality  of  Dasein’s  Being,  and  we  have
characterized care as such a totality. But in this way we have marked out the
foundations  and  the  horizons  which  must  be  clarified  if  an  analysis  of
Reality  is  to  be  possible.  Only  in  this  connection,  moreover,  does  the
character of the “in-itself” become ontologically intelligible. By taking our
orientation  from  this  context  of  problems,  we  have  in  our  earlier  analyses
Interpreted the Being of entities within-the-world.(xvii)
the  Reality  of 

the  Real  can  be  characterized
phenomenologically  within  certain  limits  without  any  explicit  existential-
ontological  basis.  This  is  what  Dilthey  has  attempted  in  the  article
mentioned  above.  He  holds  that  the  Real  gets  experienced  in  impulse  and
will,  and  that  Reality  is  resistance,  or,  more  exactly,  the  character  of
resisting.(1) He then works out the phenomenon of resistance analytically.
This  is  the  positive  contribution  of  his  article,  and  provides  the  best
concrete substantiation for his idea of a ‘psychology which both describes
and  dissects’.  But  he  is  kept  from  working  out  the  analysis  of  this
phenomenon  correctly  by  the  epistemological  problematic  of  Reality.  The
‘principle of phenomenality’ does not enable him to come to an ontological
the  same
the  Being  of  consciousness. 
Interpretation  of 
consciousness,’ he writes, ‘the will and its inhibition emerge.’(xviii) What
kind of Being belongs to this ‘emerging’? What is the meaning of the Being
of the ‘within’? What relationship-of-Being does consciousness bear to the
Real  itself?  All  this  must  be  determined  ontologically.  That  this  has  not
been  done,  depends  ultimately  on  the  fact  that  Dilthey  has  left  ‘life’
standing  in  such  a  manner  that  it  is  ontologically  undifferentiated;  and  of
course  ‘life’  is  something  which  one  cannot  go  back  ‘behind’.  But  to
Interpret  Dasein  ontologically  does  not  signify  that  we  must  go  back
ontically  to  some  other  entity.  The  fact  that  Dilthey  has  been  refuted
epistemologically  cannot  prevent  us  from  making  fruitful  use  of  what  is
positive  in  his  analyses—the  very  thing  that  has  not  been  understood  in
such refutations.
 

‘Within 

xvii.  Cf.  especially  Section  16,  H.  72  ff.  (‘How  the  Worldly  Character  of  the  Environment
Announces  itself  in  Entities  Within-the-world’);  Section  18,  H.  83  ff.  (‘Involvement  and
Significance; the Worldhood of the World’); Section 29, H. 134 ff. (‘Dasein as State-of-Mind’). On

1. ‘Realität ist Widerstand, genauer Widerständigkeit.’

 

 

H. 210

Thus  Scheler  has  recently  taken  up  Dilthey’s  Interpretation  of  Reality.
(xix)  He  stands  for  a  ‘voluntative  theory  of  Dasein’.  Here  “Dasein”  is
understood  in  the  Kantian  sense  as  Being-present-at-hand.  The  ‘Being  of
objects is given immediately only in the way it is related to drive and will’.
Scheler not only emphasizes, as does Dilthey, that Reality is never primarily
given  in  thinking  and  apprehending;  he  also  points  out  particularly  that
cognition [Erkennen] itself is not judgment, and that knowing [Wissen] is a
‘relationship of Being’.

What  we  have  already  said  about  the  ontological  indefiniteness  of
Dilthey’s  foundations  holds  in  principle  for  this  theory  too.  Nor  can  the
fundamental  ontological  analysis  of  ‘life’  be  slipped  in  afterwards  as  a
the  supporting
substructure.  Such  a  fundamental  analysis  provides 
conditions  for  the  analysis  of  Reality—for  the  entire  explication  of  the
character  of  resisting  and  its  phenomenal  presuppositions.  Resistance  is
encountered in a not-coming-through, and it is encountered as a hindrance
to  willing  to  come  through.  With  such  willing,  however,  something  must
already  have  been  disclosed  which  one’s  drive  and  one’s  will  are  out  for.
But what they are out for is ontically indefinite, and this indefiniteness must
not be overlooked ontologically or taken as if it were nothing. When Being-
out-for-something  comes  up  against  resistance,  and  can  do  nothing  but
‘come up against it’, it is itself already alongside a totality of involvements.
But  the  fact  that  this  totality  has  been  discovered  is  grounded  in  the
disclosedness of the referential totality of significance. The experiencing of
resistance—that is, the discovery of what is resistant to one’s endeavours—
is  possible  ontologically  only  by  reason  of  the  disclosedness  of  the  world.
The  character  of  resisting  is  one  that  belongs  to  entities  with-the-world.
Factically,  experiences  of  resistance  determine  only  the  extent  and  the
direction  in  which  entities  encountered  within-the-world  are  discovered.
The summation of such experiences does not introduce the disclosure of the
world for the first time, but presupposes it. The ‘against’ and the ‘counter

to’  as  ontological  possibilities,  are  supported  by  disclosed  Being-in-the-
world.
 

xix. Cf. Scheler’s lecture, ‘Die Formen des Wissens und die Bildung’, 1925, notes 24 and 25. In
reading our proofs we notice that in the collection of Scheler’s treatises which has just appeared (Die
Wissensformen  und  die  Gesellschaft,  1926)  he  has  published  his  long-promised  study  ‘Erkenntnis
und Arbeit’ (pp. 233 ff.). Division VI of this treatise (p. 455) brings a more detailed exposition of his
‘voluntative theory of Dasein’, in connection with an evaluation and critique of Dilthey.

H. 211

 

Nor  is  resistance  experienced  in  a  drive  or  will  which  ‘emerges’  in  its
own  right.  These  both  turn  out  to  be  modifications  of  care.  Only  entities
with  this  kind  of  Being  can  come  up  against  something  resistant  as
something within-the-world. So if “Reality” gets defined as “the character
of resisting”, we must notice two things: first, that this is only one character
of Reality among others; second, that the character of resisting presupposes
necessarily  a  world  which  has  already  been  disclosed.  Resistance
characterizes the ‘external world’ in the sense of entities within-the-world,
but never in the sense of the world itself. ‘Consciousness of Reality’ is itself
a  way  of  Being-in-the-world.  Every  ‘problematic  of  the  external  world’
comes back necessarily to this basic existential phenomenon.

If the ‘cogito sum’ is to serve as the point of departure for the existential
analytic  of  Dasein,  then  it  needs  to  be  turned  around,  and  furthermore  its
content needs new ontologico-phenomenal confirmation. The ‘sum’ is  then
asserted  first,  and  indeed  in  the  sense  that  “I  am  in  a  world”.  As  such  an
entity,  ‘I  am’  in  the  possibility  of  Being  towards  various  ways  of
comporting  myself—namely,  cogitationes—as  ways  of  Being  alongside
entities within-the-world. Descartes, on the contrary, says that cogitationes
are  present-at-hand,  and  that  in  these  an  ego  is  present-at-hand  too  as  a
worldless res cogitans.

(c) Reality and Care

 

“Reality”,  as  an  ontological  term,  is  one  which  we  have  related  to
entities  within-the-world.  If  it  serves  to  designate  this  kind  of  Being  in
general, then readiness-to-hand and presence-at-hand function as modes of

Reality.  If,  however,  one  lets  this  word  have  its  traditional  signification,
then it stands for Being in the sense of the pure presence-at-hand of Things.
But  not  all  presence-at-hand  is  the  presence-at-hand  of  Things.  The
‘Nature’  by  which  we  are  ‘surrounded’  is,  of  course,  an  entity  within-the-
world; but the kind of Being which it shows belongs neither to the ready-to-
hand nor to what is present-at-hand as ‘Things of Nature’. No matter how
this Being of ‘Nature’ may be Interpreted, all the modes of Being of entities
within-the-world  are  founded  ontologically  upon  the  worldhood  of  the
world, and accordingly upon the phenomenon of Being-in-the world. From
this  there  arises  the  insight  that  among  the  modes  of  Being  of  entities
within-the-world, Reality has no priority, and that Reality is a kind of Being
which cannot even characterize anything like the world or Dasein in a way
which is ontologically appropriate.

H. 212

 

In  the  order  of  the  ways  in  which  things  are  connected  in  their
ontological  foundations  and  in  the  order  of  any  possible  categorial  and
existential  demonstration,  Reality  is  referred  back  to  the  phenomenon  of
care.  But  the  fact  that  Reality  is  ontologically  grounded  in  the  Being  of
Dasein, does not signify that only when Dasein exists and as long as Dasein
exists, can the Real be as that which in itself it is.

Of  course  only  as  long  as  Dasein  is  (that  is,  only  as  long  as  an
understanding  of  Being  is  ontically  possible),  ‘is  there’  Being.(1)  When
Dasein does not exist, ‘independence’ ‘is’ not either, nor ‘is’ the ‘in-itself’.
In  such  a  case  this  sort  of  thing  can  be  neither  understood  nor  not
understood.  In  such  a  case  even  entities  within-the-world  can  neither  be
discovered nor lie hidden. In such a case it cannot be said that entities are,
nor  can  it  be  said  that  they  are  not.  But  now,  as  long  as  there  is  an
understanding of Being and therefore an understanding of presence-at-hand,
it can indeed be said that in this case entities will still continue to be.
 

1. ‘…“gibt es” Sein.’ In his letter Über den Humanismus (Klostermann, Frankfurt A.M., n.d., p.
22, reprinted from Platons Lehre von der Wahrheit, Francke A.G., Bern, 1947), Heidegger insists that
the expression ‘es gibt’ is here used deliberately, and should be taken literally as ‘it gives’. He writes:
‘For  the  “it”  which  here  “gives”  is  Being  itself.  The  “gives”,  however,  designates  the  essence  of
Being, which gives and which confers its truth.’ He adds that the ‘es gibt’ is used to avoid writing
that ‘Being is’, for the verb ‘is’ is appropriate to entities but not to Being itself.

As  we  have  noted,  Being  (not  entities)  is  dependent  upon  the
understanding  of  Being;  that  is  to  say,  Reality  (not  the  Real)  is  dependent
upon care. By this dependency our further analytic of Dasein is held secure
in  the  face  of  an  uncritical  Interpretation  which  nevertheless  keeps  urging
itself upon us—an Interpretation in which the idea of Reality is taken as the
clue  to  Dasein.  Only  if  we  take  our  orientation  from  existentiality  as
Interpreted in an ontologically positive manner, can we have any guarantee
that  in  the  factical  course  of  the  analysis  of  ‘consciousness’  or  of  ‘life’,
some sense of “Reality” does not get made basic, even if it is one which has
not been further differentiated.

Entities  with  Dasein’s  kind  of  Being  cannot  be  conceived  in  terms  of
Reality  and  substantiality;  we  have  expressed  this  by  the  thesis  that  the
substance  of  man  is  existence. Yet  if  we  have  Interpreted  existentiality  as
care,  and  distinguished  this  from  Reality,  this  does  not  signify  that  our
existential  analytic  is  at  an  end;  we  have  merely  allowed  the  intricate
problems of the question of Being and its possible modes, and the question
of the meaning of such modifications, to emerge more sharply: only if the
understanding of Being is, do entities as entities become accessible; only if
entities are of Dasein’s kind of Being is the understanding of Being possible
as an entity.

44. Dasein, Disclosedness, and Truth

 

 

H. 213

From  time  immemorial,  philosophy  has  associated  truth  and  Being.
Parmenides  was  the  first  to  discover  the  Being  of  entities,  and  he
‘identified’ Being with the perceptive understanding of Being: τὸ γὰρ αὐτὸ
νοεῖν  ἐστίν  τε  καὶ  εἶναι.(xx) Aristotle,  in  outlining  the  history  of  how  the
ἀρχαί have  been  uncovered,(xxi)  emphasizes  that  the  philosophers  before
him, under the guidance of ‘the things themselves’ have been compelled to
inquire further: αὐτὸ τὸ πρᾶγμα ὡδοποίησεν αὐτοῖς καὶ συνηνάγκασε ζητεῖν.
(xxii) He  is  describing  the  same  fact  when  he  says  that  ἀναγκαζόμενος  δ᾽
ἀκολουθεῖν  τοῖς  φαινομένοις  (xxiii)—that  he  (Parmenides)  was  compelled
to follow that which showed itself in itself. In another passage he remarks
that  these  thinkers  carried  on  their  researches  ὑπ᾽  αὐτῆς  τῆς  ἀληθείας

ἀναγκαζόμενοι(xxiv)—“compelled by the ‘truth’ itself”. Aristotle describes
these researches as φιλοσοφεῖν περὶ  τῆς  ἀληθείας(xxv)—“  ‘philosophizing’
about  the  ‘truth’  ”—or  even  as ἀποφαίνεσθαι  περὶ  τῆς  ἀληθείας(xxvi)—as
exhibiting  something  and  letting  it  be  seen  with  regard  to  the  ‘truth’  and
within the range of the ‘truth’. Philosophy itself is defined as ἐπιστήμην τῆς
ἀληθείας(xxvii)—“the science of the ‘truth’ ”. But it is also characterized as
ἐπιστήμη,  ἣ  θεωρεῖ  τὸ  ὂν  ᾗ  ὂν(xxviii)—as  “a  science  which  contemplates
entities as entities”—that is, with regard to their Being.

What  is  signified  here  by  ‘carrying  on  researches  into  the  “truth”  ’,  by
“science  of  the  ‘truth’  ”? In  such  researches  is  ‘truth’  made  a  theme  as  it
would  be  in  a  theory  of  knowledge  or  of  judgment?  Manifestly  not,  for
‘truth’  signifies  the  same  as  ‘thing’  [“Sache”],  ‘something  that  shows
itself’. But what then does the expression ‘truth’ signify if it can be used as
a term for ‘entity’ and ‘Being’?

If, however, truth rightfully has a primordial connection with Being, then
the  phenomenon  of  truth  comes  within  the  range  of  the  problematic  of
fundamental  ontology.  In  that  case,  must  not  this  phenomenon  have  been
encountered  already  within  our  preparatory  fundamental  analysis,  the
analytic  of  Dasein?  What  ontico-ontological  connection  does  ‘truth’  have
with Dasein and with that ontical characteristic of Dasein which we call the
“understanding  of  Being”?  Can  the  reason  why  Being  necessarily  goes
together  with  truth  and  vice  versa  be  pointed  out  in  terms  of  such
understanding?

These  questions  are  not  to  be  evaded.  Because  Being  does  indeed  ‘go
together’  with  truth,  the  phenomenon  of  truth  has  already  been  one  of  the
themes  of  our  earlier  analyses,  though  not  explicitly  under  this  title.  In
giving  precision  to  the  problem  of  Being,  it  is  now  time  to  delimit  the
phenomenon of truth explicitly and to fix the problems which it comprises.
In  doing  this,  we  should  not  just  take  together  what  we  have  previously
taken apart. Our investigation requires a new approach.

Our analysis takes its departure from the traditional conception of truth,
and attempts to lay bare the ontological foundations of that conception (a).
In terms of these foundations the primordial phenomenon of truth becomes
visible. We can then exhibit the way in which the traditional conception of
truth  has  been  derived  from  this  phenomenon  (b).  Our  investigation  will
make  it  plain  that  to  the  question  of  the  ‘essence’  of  truth,  there  belongs
necessarily  the  question  of  the  kind  of  Being  which  truth  possesses.
Together  with  this  we  must  clarify  the  ontological  meaning  of  the  kind  of
talk in which we say that ‘there is truth’, and we must also clarify the kind
of necessity with which ‘we must presuppose’ that ‘there is’ truth (c).

There are three theses which characterize the way in which the essence
of truth has been traditionally taken and the way it is supposed to have been
first defined: (1) that the ‘locus’ of truth is assertion (judgment); (2) that the
essence of truth lies in the ‘agreement’ of the judgment with its object; (3)
that  Aristotle,  the  father  of  logic,  not  only  has  assigned  truth  to  the
judgment as its primordial locus but has set going the definition of “truth”
as ‘agreement’.(1)

Here it is not our aim to provide a history of the concept of truth, which
could  be  presented  only  on  the  basis  of  a  history  of  ontology.  We  shall
introduce our analytical discussions by alluding to some familiar matters.

Aristotle  says  that  the  παθήματα  τῆς  ψυχῆς  are  τὧν  πραγμάτων
ὁμοιώματα(xxix)—that 
νοήματα
soul’s 
(‘representations’), are likenings of Things. This assertion, which is by no
means  proposed  as  an  explicit  definition  of  the  essence  of  truth,  has  also
given occasion for developing the later formulation of the essence of truth
as adaequatio  intellectus  et  rei.(2) Thomas  Aquinas,(xxx)  who  refers  this

‘Experiences’, 

the 

its 

definition to Avicenna (who, in turn, has taken it over from Isaac Israeli’s
tenth-century ‘Book  of  Definitions’)  also  uses  for  “adaequatio”  (likening)
the 
terms  “correspondentia”  (“correspondence”)  and  “convenientia”
(“coming together”).

1. Here we follow the older editions in reading ‘...hat sowohl die Wahrheit dem Urteil als ihrem
ursprünglichen Ort zugewiesen als auch die Definition der Wahrheit als “Ubereinstimmung” in Gang
gebracht.’ The newer editions read ‘...hat sowohl… zugewiesen, er hat auch...’

2. This is usually translated as ‘adequation of the intellect and the thing’. Heidegger makes the
connection seem closer by translating both the Latin adaequatio and the Greek ὁμοίωμα by the word
‘Angleichung’, which we have somewhat arbitrarily translated as ‘likening’.

 

 

H. 215

The  neo-Kantian  epistemology  of 

the  nineteenth  century  often
characterized 
this  definition  of  “truth”  as  an  expression  of  a
methodologically retarded naïve realism, and declared it to be irreconcilable
with  any  formulation  of  this  question  which  has  undergone  Kant’s
‘Copernican revolution’. But Kant too adhered to this conception of truth,
so  much  so  that  he  did  not  even  bring  it  up  for  discussion;  this  has  been
overlooked, though Brentano has already called our attention to it. ‘The old
and  celebrated  question  with  which  it  was  supposed  that  one  might  drive
the logicians into a corner is this: “what is truth?” The explanation of the
name of truth—namely, that it is the agreement of knowledge with its object
—will here be granted and presupposed…’(xxxi)

‘If truth consists in the agreement of knowledge with its object, then this
object  must  thus  be  distinguished  from  others;  for  knowledge  is  false  if  it
does  not  agree  with  the  object  to  which  it  is  related,  even  if  it  should
contain something which might well be valid for other objects.’(xxxii) And
in the introduction to the “Transcendental Dialectic” Kant states: ‘Truth and
illusion  are  not  in  the  object  so  far  as  it  is  intuited,  but  in  the  judgment
about it so far as it is thought.’(xxxiii)

Of  course  this  characterization  of  truth  as  ‘agreement’,  adaequatio,
ὁμοίωσις, is very general and empty. Yet it will still have some justification
if  it  can  hold  its  own  without  prejudice  to  any  of  the  most  various
Interpretations  which  that  distinctive  predicate  “knowledge”  will  support.

We  are  now  inquiring  into  the  foundations  of  this  ‘relation’.  What  else  is
tacitly posited in this relational totality of the  a d a e q u a t i o  i n t e l l e
c t u s  e t  r e i? And  what ontological  character does that which  is  thus
posited have itself?

What  in  general  does  one  have  in  view  when  one  uses  the  term
‘agreement’?  The  agreement  of  something  with  something  has  the  formal
character  of  a  relation  of  something  to  something.  Every  agreement,  and
therefore  ‘truth’  as  well,  is  a  relation.  But  not  every  relation  is  an
agreement.  A  sign  points  at  what  is  indicated.(1)  Such  indicating  is  a
relation,  but  not  an  agreement  of  the  sign  with  what  is  indicated.  Yet
manifestly  not  every  agreement  is  a  convenientia  of  the  kind  that  is  fixed
upon  in  the  definition  of  “truth”.  The  number  “6”  agrees  with  “16  minus
10”.  These  numbers  agree;  they  are  equal  with  regard  to  the  question  of
“how  much?”  Equality  is  one  way  of  agreeing.  Its  structure  is  such  that
something like a ‘with-regard-to’ belongs to it. In the adaequatio something
gets  related;  what  is  that  with  regard  to  which  it  agrees?  In  clarifying  the
‘truth-relation’  we  must  notice  also  what  is  peculiar  to  the  terms  of  this
relation. With regard to what do intellectus and res  agree? In their  kind  of
Being and their essential content do they give us anything at all with regard
to  which  they  can  agree?  If  it  is  impossible  for  intellectus  and  res  to  be
equal  because  they  are  not  of  the  same  species,  are  they  then  perhaps
similar? But knowledge is still supposed to ‘give’ the thing just as it is. This
‘agreement’  has  the  Relational  character  of  the  ‘just  as’  [“So—Wie”].  In
what way is this relation possible as a relation between intellectus and res?
From these questions it becomes plain that to clarify the structure of truth it
is not enough simply to presuppose this relational totality, but we must go
back and inquire into the context of Being which provides the support for
this totality as such.
 

1. ‘Ein Zeichen zeigt auf das Gezeigte.’

Must  we,  however,  bring  up  here  the  ‘epistemological’  problematic  as
regards  the  subject-Object  relation,  or  can  our  analysis  restrict  itself  to
Interpreting the ‘immanent consciousness of truth’, and thus remain ‘within
the sphere’ of the subject? According to the general opinion, what is true is
knowledge.  But  knowledge  is  judging.  In  judgment  one  must  distinguish
between the judging as a Real psychical process, and that which is judged,
as  an  ideal  content.  It  will  be  said  of  the  latter  that  it is  ‘true’.  The  Real
psychical  process,  however,  is  either  present-at-hand  or  not.  According  to
this  opinion,  the  ideal  content  of  judgment  stands  in  a  relationship  of
agreement. This relationship thus pertains to a connection between an ideal
content  of  judgment  and  the  Real  Thing  as  that  which  is  judged  about. Is
this agreement Real or ideal in its kind of Being, or neither of these? How
are  we  to  take  ontologically  the  relation  between  an  ideal  entity  and
something that is Real and present-at-hand? Such a relation indeed subsists
[besteht]; and in factical judgments it subsists not only as a relation between
the  content  of  judgment  and  the  Real  Object,  but  likewise  as  a  relation
between  the  ideal  content  and  the  Real  act  of  judgment.  And  does  it
manifestly subsist ‘more inwardly’ in this latter case?

Or  is  the  ontological  meaning  of  the  relation  between  Real  and  ideal
(μέθεξις) something about which we must not inquire? Yet the relation is to
be  one  which  subsists.  What  does  such  “subsisting”  [Bestand]  mean
ontologically?

H. 217

 

Why  should  this  not  be  a  legitimate  question?  Is  it  accidental  that  no
headway has been made with this problem in over two thousand years? Has
the question already been perverted in the very way it has been approached
—in the ontologically unclarified separation of the Real and the ideal?

And  with  regard  to  the  ‘actual’  judging  of  what  is  judged,  is  the
separation  of  the  Real  act  of  judgment  from  the  ideal  content  altogether
unjustified?  Does  not  the  actuality  of  knowing  and  judging  get  broken
asunder  into  two  ways  of  Being—two  ‘levels’  which  can  never  be  pieced
together  in  such  a  manner  as  to  reach  the  kind  of  Being  that  belongs  to
knowing? Is not psychologism correct in holding out against this separation,
even if it neither clarifies ontologically the kind of Being which belongs to

the  thinking  of  that  which  is  thought,  nor  is  even  so  much  as  acquainted
with it as a problem?

If  we  go  back  to  the  distinction  between  the  act  of  judgment  and  its
content, we shall not advance our discussion of the question of the kind of
Being  which  belongs  to  the  adaequatio;  we  shall  only  make  plain  the
indispensability of clarifying the kind of Being which belongs to knowledge
itself. In the analysis which this necessitates we must at the same time try to
bring  into  view  a  phenomenon  which  is  characteristic  of  knowledge—the
phenomenon  of  truth.  When  does  truth  become  phenomenally  explicit  in
knowledge itself? It does so when such knowing demonstrates itself as true.
By  demonstrating  itself  it  is  assured  of  its  truth.  Thus  in  the  phenomenal
context  of  demonstration,  the  relationship  of  agreement  must  become
visible.

Let us suppose that someone with his back turned to the wall makes the
true assertion that ‘the picture on the wall is hanging askew.’ This assertion
demonstrates itself when the man who makes it, turns round and perceives
the  picture  hanging  askew  on  the  wall.  What  gets  demonstrated  in  this
demonstration? What is the meaning of “confirming” [Bewährung] such an
assertion?  Do  we,  let  us  say,  ascertain  some  agreement  between  our
‘knowledge’ or ‘what  is  known’  and  the  Thing  on  the  wall?  Yes  and  no,
depending  upon  whether  our  Interpretation  of  the  expression  ‘what  is
known’ is phenomenally appropriate. If he who makes the assertion judges
without perceiving the picture, but ‘merely represents’ it to himself, to what
is  he  related?  To  ‘representations’,  shall  we  say?  Certainly  not,  if
“representation”  is  here  supposed  to  signify  representing,  as  a  psychical
process. Nor is he related to “representations” in the sense of what is thus
“represented,” if what we have in mind here is a ‘picture’ of that Real Thing
which is on the wall.(1) The asserting which ‘merely represents’ is related
rather, in that sense which is most its own, to the Real picture on the wall.
What  one  has  in  mind  is  the  Real  picture,  and  nothing  else.  Any
Interpretation  in  which  something  else  is  here  slipped  in  as  what  one
supposedly  has  in  mind  in  an  assertion  that  merely  represents,  belies  the
phenomenal facts of the case as to that about which the assertion gets made.
Asserting  is  a  way  of  Being  towards  the  Thing  itself  that  is.(2)  And  what
does one’s perceiving of it demonstrate?
 

1. ‘Er ist auch nicht auf Vorstellungen bezogen im Sinne des Vorgestellten, sofern damit gemeint
wird  ein  “Bild”  von  dem  realen  Ding  an  der  Wand.’  While  we  follow  tradition  in  translating

‘Vorstellung’ as ‘representation’, the literal meaning is somewhat closer to ‘putting before us’. In this
sense our ‘picture’ or ‘image’ (‘Bild’) of the actual picture (‘Bild’) on the wall, is itself something
which  we have  ‘put  before us’  and  which  is thus  ‘vorgestellt’, though in English  we would hardly
call it ‘that which we represent’.

2. ‘Das Aussagen ist ein Sein zum seienden Ding selbst.’

H. 218

 

Nothing  else  than  that  this  Thing  is  the  very  entity  which  one  has  in
mind in one’s assertion. What comes up for confirmation is that this entity
is pointed out by the Being in which the assertion is made—which is Being
towards what is put forward in the assertion; thus what is to be confirmed is
that  such  Being  uncovers  the  entity  towards  which  it  is.  What  gets
demonstrated  is  the  Being-uncovering  of  the  assertion.(1)  In  carrying  out
such a demonstration, the knowing remains related solely to the entity itself.
In  this  entity  the  confirmation,  as  it  were,  gets  enacted.  The  entity  itself
which  one  has  in  mind  shows  itself  just as  it  is  in  itself;  that  is  to  say,  it
shows  that  it,  in  its  selfsameness,  is  just  as  it  gets  pointed  out  in  the
assertion  as  being—just  as  it gets  uncovered  as  being.  Representations  do
not get compared, either among themselves or in relation to the Real Thing.
What is to be demonstrated is not an agreement of knowing with its object,
still  less  of  the  psychical  with  the  physical;  but  neither  is  it  an  agreement
between  ‘contents  of  consciousness’  among  themselves.  What  is  to  be
demonstrated  is  solely  the  Being-uncovered  [Entdeckt-sein]  of  the  entity
itself—that entity in the “how” of its uncoveredness. This uncoveredness is
confirmed  when  that  which  is  put  forward  in  the  assertion  (namely  the
entity itself) shows itself as that very same thing. “Confirmation” signifies
the  entity’s  showing  itself  in  its  selfsameness.(xxxiv)  The  confirmation  is
accomplished  on  the  basis  of  the  entity’s  showing  itself.  This  is  possible
only  in  such  a  way  that  the  knowing  which  asserts  and  which  gets
confirmed  is,  in  its  ontological  meaning,  itself  a  Being  towards  Real
entities, and a Being that uncovers.
 

xxxiv.  On  the  idea  of  demonstration  as  ‘identification’  cf.  Husserl,  Logische  Untersuchungen,
vol. II, part 2, Untersuchung VI. On ‘evidence and truth’ see ibid., Sections 36-39, pp. 115 ff. The
usual presentations of the phenomenological theory of truth confine themselves to what has been said
in the critical prolegomena (vol. I), and mention that this is connected with Bolzano’s theory of the
proposition. But the positive phenomenological Interpretations, which differ basically from Bolzano’s
theory, have been neglected. The only person who has taken up these investigations positively from
outside  the  main  stream  of  phenomenological  research,  has  been  E.  Lask,  whose  Logik  der

Philosophie  (1911)  was  as  strongly  influenced  by  the  sixth  Untersuchung  (Über  sinnliche  und
kategoriale Anschauungen’, pp. 128 ff.) as his Lehre vom Urteil (1912) was influenced by the above-
mentioned sections on evidence and truth.
 

1.  ‘Ausgewiesen  wird  das  Entdeckend-sein  der  Aussage.’  Here  and  in  the  following  pages  we
find the expression ‘Entdeckend-sein’ consistently printed with a hyphen in the more recent editions.
In the older editions it is written sometimes as one word, sometimes as two, and it is hyphenated only
at the ends of lines. In both editions we sometimes find this word printed with a lower-case initial.
We have marked such cases with an asterisk; for while we prefer the translation ‘Being-uncovering’
in such cases, the lower-case initia suggests that ‘to-be-uncovering’ may be a better reading.

H. 219

 

To say that an assertion “is true” signifies that it uncovers the entity as it
is in itself. Such an assertion asserts, points out, ‘lets’ the entity ‘be seen’
(ἀπόφανσις)  in  its  uncoveredness.  The  Being-true  (truth)  of  the  assertion
must be understood as Being-uncovering*. Thus truth has by no means the
structure of an agreement between knowing and the object in the sense of a
likening of one entity (the subject) to another (the Object).

Being-true  as  Being-uncovering*,  is  in  turn  ontologically  possible  only
on the basis of Being-in-the-world. This latter phenomenon, which we have
known  as  a  basic  state  of  Dasein,  is  the  foundation  for  the  primordial
phenomenon of truth. We shall now follow this up more penetratingly.

(b)  The  Primordial  Phenomenon  of  Truth  and  the  Derivative

Character of the Traditional Conception of Truth
 

“Being-true” (“truth”) means Being-uncovering*. But is not this a highly
arbitrary  way  to  define  “truth”?  By  such  drastic  ways  of  defining  this
concept  we  may  succeed  in  eliminating  the  idea  of  agreement  from  the
conception of truth. Must we not pay for this dubious gain by plunging the
‘good’  old  tradition  into  nullity?  But  while  our  definition  is  seemingly
arbitrary,  it  contains  only  the  necessary  Interpretation  of  what  was
primordially surmised in the oldest tradition of ancient philosophy and even
understood in a pre-phenomenological manner. If a λόγος as ἀπόφανσις is to
be  true,  its  Being-true  is  ἀληθεύειν  in  the  manner  of  ἀποφαίνεσθαι—of
taking  entities  out  of  their  hiddenness  and  letting  them  be  seen  in  their
unhiddenness  (their  uncoveredness).  The  ἀλήθεια  which  Aristotle  equates

with πρᾶγμα and φαινόμενα in the passages cited above, signifies the ‘things
themselves’;  it  signifies  what  shows  itself—entities in  the  “how”  of  their
uncoveredness.  And  is  it  accidental  that  in  one  of  the  fragments  of
Heracleitus(xxxv)—the oldest fragments of philosophical doctrine in which
the  λόγος  is  explicitly  handled—the  phenomenon  of  truth  in  the  sense  of
uncoveredness  (unhiddenness)  as  we  have  set  it  forth,  shows  through?
Those who are lacking in understanding are contrasted with the λόγος,  and
also  with  him  who  speaks  that  λόγος,  and  understands  it.  The  λόγος  is
φράζων  όπως  ἔχει:  it  tells  bow  entities  comport  themselves.  But  to  those
who are lacking in understanding, what they do remains hidden—λανθάνει.
They  forget  it  (ἐπιλανθάνονται);  that  is,  for  them  it  sinks  back  into
hiddenness. Thus to the λόγος belongs unhiddennes—ἀ-λήθεια. To translate
this word as ‘truth’, and, above all, to define this expression conceptually in
theoretical ways, is to cover up the meaning of what the Greeks made ‘self-
evidently’ basic for the terminological use of ἀλήθεια as a pre-philosophical
way of understanding it.
 

xxxv. Cf. Diels, Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, Heracleitus fragment B 1.

H. 220

 

In  citing  such  evidence  we  must  avoid  uninhibited  word-mysticism.
Nevertheless, the ultimate business of philosophy is to preserve the force of
the most elemental words in which Dasein expresses itself, and to keep the
common  understanding  from  levelling  them  off  to  that  unintelligibility
which functions in turn as a source of pseudo-problems.

We  have  now  given  a  phenomenal  demonstration  of  what  we  set  forth
earlier(xxxvi)  as  to  λόγος  and  ἀλήθεια  in,  so  to  speak,  a  dogmatic
Interpretation. In proposing our ‘definition’ of “truth” we have not shaken
off  the  tradition,  but  we  have  appropriated  it  primordially;  and  we  shall
have done so all the more if we succeed in demonstrating that the idea of
agreement is one to which theory had to come on the basis of the primordial
phenomenon of truth, and if we can show how this came about.

Moreover, the ‘definition’ of “truth” as “uncoveredness” and as “Being-
uncovering”,  it  not  a  mere  explanation  of  a  word.  Among  those  ways  in
which  Dasein  comports  itself  there  are  some  which  we  are  accustomed  in

the  first  instance  to  call  ‘true’;  from  the  analysis  of  these  our  definition
emerges.

Being-true  as  Being-uncovering*,  is  a  way  of  Being  for  Dasein.  What
makes this very uncovering possible must necessarily be called ‘true’ in a
still  more  primordial  sense.  The  most  primordial  phenomenon  of  truth  is
first shown by the existential-ontological foundations of uncovering.

Uncovering  is  a  way  of  Being  for  Being-in-the-world.  Circumspective
concern,  or  even  that  concern  in  which  we  tarry  and  look  at  something,
uncovers  entities  within-the-world.  These  entities  become  that  which  has
been  uncovered.  They  are  ‘true’  in  a  second  sense.  What  is  primarily
‘true’—that is, uncovering—is Dasein. “Truth” in the second sense does not
Being-uncovered
mean 
(uncoveredness).
 

Being-uncovering*

Our earlier analysis of the worldhood of the world and of entities within-
the-world  has  shown,  however,  that  the  uncoveredness  of  entities  within-
the-world  is  grounded  in  the  world’s  disclosedness.  But  disclosedness  is
that  basic  character  of  Dasein  according  to  which  it  is  its  “there”.
Disclosedness is constituted by state-of-mind, understanding, and discourse,
and pertains equiprimordially to the world, to Being-in, and to the Self. In
its  very  structure,  care  is  ahead  of  itself—Being  already  in  a  world—as
Being  alongside  entities  within-the-world;  and  in  this  structure  the
disclosedness of Dasein lies hidden. With and through it is  uncoveredness;
(1)  hence  only  with  Dasein’s  disclosedness  is  the  most  primordial
phenomenon of truth attained. What we have pointed out earlier with regard
to  the  existential  Constitution  of  the  “there”(xxxvii)  and  in  relation  to  the
everyday  Being  of  the  “there”,(xxxviii)  pertains  to  the  most  primordial
phenomenon of truth, nothing less. In so far as Dasein is its disclosedness
essentially, and discloses and uncovers as something disclosed to this extent
it is essentially ‘true’. Dasein is  ‘in  the  truth’. This  assertion has meaning
ontologically. It does not purport to say that ontically Dasein is introduced
‘to  all  the  truth’  either  always  or  just  in  every  case,  but  rather  that  the
disclosedness of its ownmost Being belongs to its existential constitution.

1. ‘Mit und durch sie ist Entdecktheit...’ Our version reflects the ambiguity of the German, which
leaves  the  grammatical  function  of  the  pronoun  ‘sie’  obscure  and  permits  it  to  refer  either  to  ‘the
disclosedness of Dasein’, to ‘care’, or—perhaps most likely—to ‘the structure of care’.

If  we  accept  the  results  we  have  obtained  earlier,  the  full  existential
meaning of the principle that ‘Dasein is in the truth’ can be restored by the
following considerations:

(1)  To  Dasein’s  state  of  Being,  disclosedness  in  general  essentially
belongs. It embraces the whole of that structure-of-Being which has become
explicit through the phenomenon of care. To care belongs not only Being-
in-the-world  but  also  Being  alongside  entities  within-the-world.  The
uncoveredness of such entities is equiprimordial with the Being of Dasein
and its disclosedness.

(2)  To  Dasein’s  state  of  Being  belongs  thrownness;  indeed  it  is
constitutive  for  Dasein’s  disclosedness.  In  thrownness  is  revealed  that  in
each case Dasein, as  m y  Dasein and  t h i s  Dasein, is already in a definite
world  and  alongside  a  definite  range  of  definite  entities  within-the-world.
(1) Disclosedness is essentially factical.

(3)  To  Dasein’s  state  of  Being  belongs  projection—disclosive  Being
towards  its  potentiality-for-Being.  As  something  that  understands,  Dasein
can understand itself in  terms  of  the  ‘world’  and  Others  or  in  terms  of  its
ownmost  potentiality-for-Being.(2)  The  possibility  just  mentioned  means
that Dasein discloses itself to itself in and as its ownmost potentiality-for-
Being.  This  authentic  disclosedness  shows  the  phenomenon  of  the  most
primordial  truth  in  the  mode  of  authenticity.  The  most  primordial,  and
indeed the most authentic, disclosedness in which Dasein, as a potentiality-
for-Being, can be, is the truth of existence.  This  becomes existentially and
ontologically  definite  only  in  connection  with  the  analysis  of  Dasein’s
authenticity.
 

1. ‘In ihr enthüllt sich, dass Dasein je schon als meines und dieses in einer bestimmten Welt und

bei einem bestimmten Umkreis von bestimmten innerweltlichen Seienden ist.’

2.  ‘…der  Entwurf:  das  erschliessende  Sein  zu  seinem  Seinkönnen.  Dasein  kann  sich  als
verstehendes aus der “Welt” und den Anderen her verstehen oder aus seinem eigensten Seinkönnen.’
The earlier editions have a full stop after ‘Entwurf’ rather than a colon, and introduce ‘das’ with a
capital. The grammatical function of ‘als verstehendes’ seems ambiguous.

H. 222

 

(4)  To  Dasein’s  state  of  Being  belongs  falling.  Proximally  and  for  the
most  part  Dasein  is  lost  in  its  ‘world’.  Its  understanding,  as  a  projection
upon possibilities of Being, has diverted itself thither. Its absorption in the
“they”  signifies  that  it  is  dominated  by  the  way  things  are  publicly
interpreted. That which has been uncovered and disclosed stands in a mode
in  which  it  has  been  disguised  and  closed  off  by  idle  talk,  curiosity,  and
ambiguity. Being towards entities has not been extinguished, but it has been
uprooted. Entities have not been completely hidden; they are precisely the
sort of thing that has been uncovered, but at the same time they have been
disguised. They show themselves, but in the mode of semblance. Likewise
what has formerly been uncovered sinks back again, hidden and disguised.
Because Dasein is essentially falling, its state of Being is such that it is in
‘untruth’. This term, like the expression ‘falling’, is here used ontologically.
If  we  are  to  use  it  in  existential  analysis,  we  must  avoid  giving  it  any
ontically negative ‘evaluation’. To be closed off and covered up belongs to
Dasein’s facticity. In its full existential-ontological meaning, the proposition
that  ‘Dasein  is  in  the  truth’  states  equiprimordially  that  ‘Dasein  is  in
untruth’.  But  only  in  so  far  as  Dasein  has  been  disclosed  has  it  also  been
closed  off;  and  only  in  so  far  as  entities  within-the-world  have  been
uncovered along with Dasein, have such entities, as possibly encounterable
within-the-world, been covered up (hidden) or disguised.

It  is  therefore  essential  that  Dasein  should  explicitly  appropriate  what
has already been uncovered, defend it against semblance and disguise, and
assure  itself  of  its  uncoveredness  again  and  again.  The  uncovering  of
anything  new  is  never  done  on  the  basis  of  having  something  completely
hidden,  but  takes  its  departure  rather  from  uncoveredness  in  the  mode  of
semblance.  Entities  look  as  if...  That  is,  they  have,  in  a  certain  way,  been
uncovered already, and yet they are still disguised.

Truth  (uncoveredness)  is  something  that  must  always  first  be  wrested
from  entities.  Entities  get  snatched  out  of  their  hiddenness.  The  factical
uncoveredness  of  anything  is  always,  as  it  were,  a  kind  of  robbery.  Is  it
accidental  that  when  the  Greeks  express  themselves  as  to  the  essence  of
truth, they use a privative expression—ἀ-λήθεια? When Dasein so expresses
itself, does not a primordial understanding of its own Being thus make itself

known—the understanding (even if it is only pre-ontological) that Being-in-
untruth makes up an essential characteristic of Being-in-the-world?

The goddess of Truth who guides Parmenides, puts two pathways before
him, one of uncovering, one of hiding; but this signifies nothing else than
that  Dasein  is  already  both  in  the  truth  and  in  untruth.  The  way  of
uncovering  is  achieved  only  in  κρίνειν  λόγῳ—in  distinguishing  between
these understandingly, and making one’s decision for the one rather than the
other.(xxxix)
 

xxxix.  Karl  Reinhardt  (Cf.  his  Parmenides  und  die  Geschichte  der  grieschischen  Philosophie,
1916)  was  the  first  to  conceptualize  and  solve  the  hackneyed  problem  of  how  the  two  parts  of
Parmenides’ poem are connected, though he did not explicitly point out the ontological foundation
for the connection between ἀλήθεια and δόξα, or its necessity.

H. 223

 

The existential-ontological condition for the fact that Being-in-the-world
is characterized by ‘truth’ and ‘untruth’, lies in that state of Dasein’s Being
which  we  have  designated  as  thrown  projection.  This  is  something  that  is
constitutive for the structure of care.

The  upshot  of  our  existential-ontological 

the
phenomenon  of  truth  is  (1)  that  truth,  in  the  most  primordial  sense,  is
Dasein’s  disclosedness,  to  which  the  uncoveredness  of  entities  within-the-
world belongs; and (2) that Dasein is equiprimordially both in the truth and
in untruth.

Interpretation  of 

that 

Within the horizon of the traditional Interpretation of the phenomenon of
truth,  our  insight  into  these  principles  will  not  be  complete  until  it  can  be
truth,  understood  as  agreement,  originates  from
shown:  (1) 
disclosedness  by  way  of  definite  modification;  (2) that  the  kind  of  Being
which belongs to disclosedness itself is such that its derivative modification
first comes into view and leads the way for the theoretical explication of the
structure of truth.

Assertion  and  its  structure  (namely,  the  apophantical  “as”)  are  founded
upon interpretation and its structure (viz, the hermeneutical “as”) and also
upon  understanding—upon  Dasein’s  disclosedness.  Truth,  however,  is
regarded as a distinctive character of assertion as so derived. Thus the roots
of  the  truth  of  assertion  reach  back  to  the  disclosedness  of  the
understanding.(xl) But over and above these indications of how the truth of

assertion  has  originated,  the  phenomenon  of  agreement  must  now  be
exhibited explicitly in its derivative character.
 

xl. Cf. Section 33 above, H. 153 ff. (‘Assertion as a derivative mode of interpretation.’)

H. 224

 

Our  Being  alongside  entities  within-the-world  is  concern,  and  this  is
Being  which  uncovers.  To  Dasein’s  disclosedness,  however,  discourse
belongs  essentially.(xli)  Dasein  expresses  itself  [spricht  sich  aus]:  it
expresses  itself  as  a  Being-towards  entities—a  Being-towards  which
uncovers.  And  in  assertion  it  expresses  itself  as  such  about  entities  which
have been uncovered. Assertion communicates entities in the “how” of their
uncoveredness. When Dasein is aware of the communication, it brings itself
in  its  awareness  into  an  uncovering  Being-towards  the  entities  discussed.
The assertion which is expressed is about something, and in what it is about
[in  ihrem  Worüber]  it  contains  the  uncoveredness  of  these  entities.  This
uncoveredness  is  preserved  in  what  is  expressed.  What  is  expressed
becomes, as it were, something ready-to-hand  within-the-world  which can
be  taken  up  and  spoken  again.(1)  Because  the  uncoveredness  has  been
preserved,  that  which  is  expressed  (which  thus  is  ready-to-hand)  has  in
itself  a  relation  to  any  entities  about  which  it  is  an  assertion.  Any
uncoveredness  is  an  uncoveredness  of  something.  Even  when  Dasein
speaks  over  again  what  someone  else  has  said,  it  comes  into  a  Being-
towards  the  very  entities  which  have  been  discussed.(2)  But  it  has  been
exempted  from  having  to  uncover  them  again,  primordially,  and  it  holds
that it has been thus exempted.
 

xli. Cf. Section 34, H. 160 ff.

 

1. ‘Das Ausgesprochene wird gleichsam zu einem innerweltlich Zuhandenen, das aufgenommen
und  weitergesprochen  werden  kann.’  While  we  have  followed  our  usual  policy  in  translating  ‘das
Ausgesprochene’ as ‘what is expressed’, it might perhaps be translated as ‘that which is spoken out’,
‘the utterance’, or even ‘the pronouncement’.

2.  “Auch  im  Nachsprechen  kommt  das  nachsprechende  Dasein  in  ein  Sein  zum  besprochenen

Seienden selbst.’

Dasein  need  not  bring  itself  face  to  face  with  entities  themselves  in  an
‘original’ experience; but it nevertheless remains in a Being-towards these

entities.  In  a  large  measure  uncoveredness  gets  appropriated  not  by  one’s
own  uncovering,  but  rather  by  hearsay  of  something  that  has  been  said.
Absorption  in  something  that  has  been  said  belongs  to  the  kind  of  Being
which  the  “they”  possesses.  That  which  has  been  expressed  as  such  takes
over  Being-towards  those  entities  which  have  been  uncovered  in  the
assertion.  If,  however,  these  entities  are  to  be  appropriated  explicitly  with
regard to their uncoveredness, this amounts to saying that the assertion is to
be  demonstrated  as  one  that  uncovers.  But  the  assertion  expressed  is
something  ready-to-hand,  and  indeed  in  such  a  way  that,  as  something  by
which  uncoveredness  is  preserved,  it  has  in  itself  a  relation  to  the  entities
uncovered. Now to demonstrate that it is something which uncovers [ihres
Entdeckend-seins]  means  to  demonstrate  how  the  assertion  by  which  the
uncoveredness  is  preserved  is  related  to  these  entities.  The  assertion  is
something  ready-to-hand.  The  entities  to  which  it  is  related  as  something
that uncovers, are either ready-to-hand or present-at-hand within-the-world.
The  relation  itself  presents  itself  thus,  as  one  that  is  present-at-hand.  But
this relation lies in the fact that the uncoveredness preserved in the assertion
is in each case an uncoveredness  o f   something. The  judgment  ‘contains
something  which  holds  for  the  objects’  (Kant).  But  the  relation  itself  now
acquires  the  character  of  presence-at-hand  by  getting  switched  over  to  a
relationship between things which are  present-at-hand.  The uncoveredness
of something becomes the present-at-hand conformity of one thing which is
present-at-hand—the  assertion  expressed—to  something  else  which  is
present-at-hand—the entity under discussion. And if this conformity is seen
only as a relationship between things which are present-at-hand—that is, if
the  kind  of  Being  which  belongs  to  the  terms  of  this  relationship  has  not
been discriminated and is understood as something merely present-at-hand
—then  the  relation  shows  itself  as  an  agreement  of  two  things  which  are
present-at-hand, an agreement which is present-at-hand itself.

H. 225

 

When the assertion has been expressed, the uncoveredness of the entity
moves  into  the  kind  of  Being  of  that  which  is  ready-to-hand  within-the-
world.(1)  But  now  to  the  extent  that  in  this  uncoveredness,  as  an
uncoveredness  o f  something, a relationship to something present-at-hand
persists,  the  uncoveredness  (truth)  becomes,  for  its  part,  a  relationship

between things which are present-at-hand (i n t e l l e c t u s  and  r e s)—a
relationship that is present-at-hand itself.
 

1. ‘Die Entdecktheit des Seienden rückt mit der Ausgesprochenheit der Aussage in die Seinsart

des innerweltlich Zuhandenen.’

Though  it  is  founded  upon  Dasein’s  disclosedness,  the  existential
phenomenon  of  uncoveredness  becomes  a  property  which  is  present-at-
hand  but  in  which  there  still  lurks  a  relational  character;  and  as  such  a
property, it gets broken asunder into a relationship which is present-at-hand.
Truth as disclosedness and as a Being-towards uncovered entities—a Being
which  itself  uncovers—has  become  truth  as  agreement  between  things
which are present-at-hand within-the-world. And thus we have pointed out
the ontologically derivative character of the traditional conception of truth.

Yet that which is last in the order of the way things are connected in their
foundations  existentially  and  ontologically,  is  regarded  ontically  and
factically as that which is first and closest to us. The necessity of this Fact,
however,  is  based  in  turn  upon  the  kind  of  Being  which  Dasein  itself
possesses. Dasein, in  its concernful  absorption,  understands itself in  terms
of what it encounters within-the-world.  The  uncoveredness which belongs
to  uncovering,  is  something  that  we  come  across  proximally  within-the-
world  in  that  which  has  been  expressed  [im  Ausgesprochenen].  Not  only
truth,  however, 
in  general  our
is  encountered  as  present-at-hand: 
understanding  of  Being  is  such  that  every  entity  is  understood  in  the  first
instance as present-at-hand. If the ‘truth’ which we encounter proximally in
an  ontical  manner  is  considered  ontologically  in  the  way  that  is  closest  to
us,  then  the  λόγος  (the  assertion)  gets  understood  as  λόγος  τινός—as  an
assertion    a  b  o  u  t    something,  an  uncoveredness  of  something;  but  the
phenomenon  gets  Interpreted  as  something  present-at-hand  with  regard  to
its  possible  presence-at-hand.(1)  Yet  because  presence-at-hand  has  been
equated with the meaning of Being in general, the question of whether this
kind  of  Being  of  truth  is  a  primordial  one,  and  whether  there  is  anything
primordial  in  that  structure  of  it  which  we  encounter  as  closest  to  us,  can
not come alive at all. The primordial phenomenon of truth has been covered
up  by  Dasein’s  very  understanding  of  Being—that  understanding  which  is
proximally  the  one  that  prevails,  and  which  even  today  has  not  been
surmounted explicitly and in principle.

At the same time, however, we must not overlook the fact that while this
way of understanding Being (the way which is closest to us) is one which
the  Greeks  were  the  first  to  develop  as  a  branch  of  knowledge  and  to
master,  the  primordial  understanding  of  truth  was  simultaneously  alive
among them, even if pre-ontologically, and it even held its own against the
concealment implicit in their ontology—at least in Aristotle.(xlii)
 

xlii. Cf. Aristotle, Ethica Nicomachea Z and Metaphysica Θ 10.

1. ‘…interpretiert aber das Phänomen als Vorhandenes auf seine mögliche Vorhandenheit.’

 

 

H. 226

Aristotle never defends the thesis that the primordial ‘locus’ of truth is in
the judgment. He says rather that the λόγος is that way of Being in which
Dasein  can  either uncover or  cover  up.  This  double  possibility  is  what  is
distinctive  in  the  Being-true  of  the  λόγος:  the  λόγος  is  that  way  of
comporting oneself which can also cover things up. And because  Aristotle
never upheld the thesis we have mentioned, he was also never in a situation
to ‘broaden’ the conception of truth in the λόγος to include pure νοεῖν. The
truth  of  αἴσθησις  and  of  the  seeing  of  ‘ideas’  is  the  primordial  kind  of
uncovering. And only because νόησις primarily uncovers, can the λόγος as
διανοεῖν also have uncovering as its function.

Not  only  is  it  wrong  to  invoke  Aristotle  for  the  thesis  that  the  genuine
‘locus’ of truth lies in the judgment; even in its content this thesis fails to
recognize the structure of truth. Assertion is not the primary ‘locus’ of truth.
On the contrary, whether as a mode in which uncoveredness is appropriated
or  as  a  way  of  Being-in-the-world,  assertion  is  grounded  in  Dasein’s
uncovering, or rather in its disclosedness. The most primordial ‘truth’ is the
‘locus’  of  assertion;  it  is  the  ontological  condition  for  the  possibility  that
assertions can be either true or false—that they may uncover or cover things
up.

Truth,  understood  in  the  most  primordial  sense,  belongs  to  the  basic
constitution of Dasein. The term signifies an existentiale. But herewith we
have  already  sketched  out  our  answers  to  the  question  of  what  kind  of
Being truth possesses, and to the question of in what sense it is necessary to
presuppose that ‘there is truth’.

(c) The Kind of Being which Truth Possesses, and the Presupposition

of Truth
 

H. 227

 

Dasein,  as  constituted  by  disclosedness,  is  essentially  in  the  truth.
Disclosedness  is  a  kind  of  Being  which  is  essential  to  Dasein.  ‘There  is’
truth only in so far as Dasein  i s  and so long as Dasein  i s. Entities  are
uncovered  only  when  Dasein  is;  and  only  as  long  as  Dasein  is,  are  they
disclosed. Newton’s laws, the principle of contradiction, any truth whatever
—these  are  true  only  as  long  as  Dasein  is.  Before  there  was  any  Dasein,
there  was  no  truth;  nor  will  there  be  any  after  Dasein  is  no  more.  For  in
such a case truth as disclosedness, uncovering, and uncoveredness, cannot
be. Before Newton’s laws were discovered, they were not ‘true’; it does not
follow  that  they  were  false,  or  even  that  they  would  become  false  if
ontically no discoveredness were any longer possible. Just as little does this
‘restriction’  imply  that  the  Being-true  of  ‘truths’  has  in  any  way  been
diminished.

To  say  that  before  Newton  his  laws  were  neither  true  nor  false,  cannot
signify that before him there were no such entities as have been uncovered
and pointed out by those laws. Through Newton the laws became true; and
with  them,  entities  became  accessible  in  themselves  to  Dasein.  Once
entities  have  been  uncovered,  they  show  themselves  precisely  as  entities
which  beforehand  already  were.  Such  uncovering  is  the  kind  of  Being
which belongs to ‘truth’.

That  there  are  ‘eternal  truths’  will  not  be  adequately  proved  until
someone has succeeded in demonstrating that Dasein has been and will be
for  all  eternity.  As  long  as  such  a  proof  is  still  outstanding,  this  principle
remains  a  fanciful  contention  which  does  not  gain  in  legitimacy  from
having philosophers commonly ‘believe’ it.

Because the kind of Being that is essential to truth is of the character of
Dasein,  all  truth  is  relative  to  Dasein’s  Being.  Does  this  relativity  signify
that  all  truth  is  ‘subjective’?  If  one  Interprets  ‘subjective’  as  ‘left  to  the
subject’s discretion’, then it certainly does not. For uncovering, in the sense
which  is  most  its  own,  takes  asserting  out  of  the  province  of  ‘subjective’
discretion,  and  brings  the  uncovering  Dasein  face  to  face  with  the  entities
themselves.  And  only  because  ‘truth’,  as  uncovering,  is  a  kind  of  Being

which  belongs  to  Dasein, can  it  be  taken  out  of  the  province  of  Dasein’s
discretion. Even the ‘universal validity’ of truth is rooted solely in the fact
that Dasein can uncover entities in themselves and free them. Only so can
these entities in themselves be binding for every possible assertion—that is,
for  every  way  of  pointing  them  out.(1)  If  truth  has  been  correctly
understood, is it in the least impaired by the fact that it is ontically possible
only  in  the  ‘subject’  and  that  it  stands  and  falls  with  the  Being  of  that
‘subject’?
 

1.  ‘Auch  die  “Allgemeingültigkeit”  der  Wahrheit  ist  lediglich  verwurzelt,  dass  das  Dasein
Seiendes an ihm selbst entdecken und freigeben kann. Nur so vermag dieses Seiende an ihm selbst
jede mögliche Aussage, das heisst Aufzeigung seiner, zu binden.’

H. 228

 

Now  that  we  have  an  existential  conception  of  the  kind  of  Being  that
belongs  to  truth,  the  meaning  of  “presupposing  the  truth”  also  becomes
intelligible.  Why  must  we  presuppose  that  there  is  truth?  What  is
‘presupposing’?  What  do  we  have  in  mind  with  the  ‘must’  and  the  ‘we’?
What  does  it  mean  to  say  ‘there  is  truth’?  ‘We’  presuppose  truth  because
‘we’, being in the kind of Being which Dasein possesses, are ‘in the truth’.
We do not presuppose it as something ‘outside’ us and ‘above’ us, towards
which,  along  with  other  ‘values’,  we  comport  ourselves.  It  is  not  we  who
presuppose ‘truth’; but it is ‘truth’ that makes it at all possible ontologically
for  us  to  be  able  to  be such  that  we  ‘presuppose’  anything  at  all.  Truth  is
what first makes possible anything like presupposing.

What does it mean to ‘presuppose’? It is to understand something as the
ground for the Being of some other entity. Such understanding of an entity
in  its  interconnections  of  Being,  is  possible  only  on  the  ground  of
disclosedness—that  is,  on  the  ground  of  Dasein’s  Being  something  which
uncovers.  Thus  to  presuppose  ‘truth’  means  to  understand  it  as  something
for  the  sake of which Dasein  i s. But Dasein is  already ahead of itself in
each  case;  this  is  implied  in  its  state-of-Being  as  care.  It  is  an  entity  for
which,  in  its  Being,  its  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being  is  an  issue.  To
Dasein’s  Being  and  its  potentiality-for-Being  as  Being-in-the-world,
disclosedness and uncovering belong essentially. To Dasein its potentiality-
for-Being-in-the-world  is  an  issue,  and  this  includes(1)  concerning  itself
with  entities  within-the-world  and  uncovering  them  circumspectively.  In

Dasein’s  state-of-Being  as  care,  in  Being-ahead-of-itself,  lies  the  most
primordial  ‘presupposing’.  Because  this  presupposing  of  itself  belongs  to
Dasein’s  Being,  ‘we’  must  also  presuppose  ‘ourselves’  as  having  the
attribute of disclosedness. There are also entities with a character other than
that of Dasein, but the ‘presupposing’ which lies in Dasein’s Being does not
relate itself to these; it relates itself solely to Dasein itself. The truth which
has been presupposed, or the ‘there is’ by which its Being is to be defined,
has  that  kind  of  Being—or  meaning  of  Being—which  belongs  to  Dasein
itself. We must ‘make’ the presupposition of truth because it is one that has
been ‘made’ already with the Being of the ‘we’.

We must presuppose truth. Dasein itself, as in each case  m y  Dasein and
  t  h  i  s    Dasein,  must  be;  and  in  the  same  way  the  truth,  as  Daseins
disclosedness, must be. This  belongs to  Dasein’s essential  thrownness  into
the world. Has Dasein as itself ever decided freely whether it wants to come
into ‘Dasein’ or not, and will it ever be able to make such a decision? ‘In
itself’  it  is  quite  incomprehensible  why  entities  are  to  be  uncovered,  why
truth  and  Dasein  must  be.  The  usual  refutation  of  that  scepticism  which
denies either the Being of ‘truth’ or its cognizability, stops half way. What it
shows,  as  a  formal  argument,  is  simply  that  if  anything  gets  judged,  truth
has been presupposed. This suggests that ‘truth’ belongs to assertion—that
pointing  something  out  is,  by  its  very  meaning,  an  uncovering.  But  when
one says this, one has to clarify why that in which there lies the ontological
ground for this necessary connection between assertion and truth as regards
their  Being,  must  be  as  it  is.  The  kind  of  Being  which  belongs  to  truth  is
likewise  left  completely  obscure,  and  so  is  the  meaning  of  presupposing,
and that of its ontological  foundation  in  Dasein itself. Moreover,  one here
fails  to  recognize  that  even  when  nobody  judges,  truth  already  gets
presupposed in so far as Dasein  i s  at all.

H. 229

 

A sceptic can no more be refuted than the Being of truth can be ‘proved’.
And if any sceptic of the kind who denies the truth, factically is, he does not
even need  to  be  refuted.  In  so  far  as  he  is,  and  has  understood  himself  in
this  Being,  he  has  obliterated  Dasein  in  the  desperation  of  suicide;  and  in
doing  so,  he  has  also  obliterated  truth.  Because  Dasein,  for  its  own  part,
cannot  first  be  subjected  to  proof,  the  necessity  of  truth  cannot  be  proved

either.  It  has  no  more  been  demonstrated  that  there  ever  has  ‘been’  an
‘actual’ sceptic(2) (though  this is  what has at  bottom  been believed  in  the
refutations of scepticism, in spite of what these undertake to do) than it has
been  demonstrated  that  there  are  any  ‘eternal  truths’.  But  perhaps  such
sceptics  have  been  more  frequent  than  one  would  innocently  like  to  have
true when one tries to bowl over ‘scepticism’ by formal dialectics.
 

1. Reading ‘und darin’ with the newer editions. The older editions have ‘d.h. u.a.’
2.  ‘…dass  es  je...  einen  “wirklichen”  Skeptiker  “gegeben”  hat.’  The  older  editions  have  ‘nie’

(‘never’) instead of ‘je’ (‘ever’).

Thus  with  the  question  of  the  Being  of  truth  and  the  necessity  of
presupposing  it,  just  as  with  the  question  of  the  essence  of  knowledge,  an
‘ideal  subject’  has  generally  been  posited.  The  motive  for  this,  whether
explicit or tacit, lies in the requirement that philosophy should have the ‘a
priori’  as  its  theme,  rather  than  ‘empirical  facts’  as  such.  There  is  some
justification  for  this  requirement,  though  it  still  needs  to  be  grounded
ontologically.  Yet  is  this  requirement  satisfied  by  positing  an  ‘ideal
subject’?  Is  not  such  a  subject  a  fanciful  idealization?  With  such  a
conception  have  we  not  missed  precisely  the  a  priori  character  of  that
merely  ‘factual’  subject,  Dasein?  Is  it  not  an  attribute  of  the  a  priori
character  of  the  factical  subject  (that  is,  an  attribute  of  Dasein’s  facticity)
that it is in the truth and in untruth equiprimordially?

The ideas of a ‘pure “I” ’and of a ‘consciousness in general’ are so far
from  including  the  a  priori  character  of  ‘actual’  subjectivity  that  the
ontological characters of Dasein’s facticity and its state of Being are either
passed over or not seen at all. Rejection of a ‘consciousness in general’ does
not  signify  that  the  a priori is  negated,  any  more  than  the  positing  of  an
idealized subject guarantees that Dasein has an a priori character grounded
upon fact.

Both  the  contention  that  there  are  ‘eternal  truths’  and  the  jumbling
together  of  Dasein’s  phenomenally  grounded  ‘ideality’  with  an  idealized
absolute  subject,  belong  to  those  residues  of  Christian  theology  within
philosophical problematics which have not as yet been radically extruded.

H. 230

 

The  Being  of  truth  is  connected  primordially  with  Dasein.  And  only
because  Dasein    i  s    as  constituted  by  disclosedness  (that  is,  by
understanding),  can  anything  like  Being  be  understood;  only  so  is  it
possible to understand Being.

Being (not entities) is something which ‘there is’ only in so far as truth
is. And truth is only in so far as and as long as Dasein is. Being and truth
‘are’ equiprimordially. What does it signify that Being ‘is’, where Being is
to  be  distinguished  from  every  entity?  One  can  ask  this  concretely  only  if
the meaning of Being and the full scope of the understanding of Being have
in general been clarified. Only then can one also analyse primordially what
belongs to the concept of a science of Being as such, and to its possibilities
and its variations. And in demarcating this research and its truth, the kind of
research in which entities are uncovered, and its accompanying truth, must
be defined ontologically.

The answer to the question of the meaning of Being has yet to be given
[steht...  aus].  What  has  our  fundamental  analysis  of  Dasein,  as  we  have
carried  it  out  so  far,  contributed  to  working  out  this  question?  By  laying
bare  the  phenomenon  of  care,  we  have  clarified  the  state  of  Being  of  that
entity  to  whose  Being  something  like  an  understanding  of  Being  belongs.
At  the  same  time  the  Being  of  Dasein  has  thus  been  distinguished  from
modes  of  Being  (readiness-to-hand,  presence-at-hand,  Reality)  which
characterize  entities  with  a  character  other 
that  of  Dasein.
Understanding  has  itself  been  elucidated;  and  at  the  same  time  the
methodological  transparency  of  the  procedure  of  Interpreting  Being  by
understanding it and interpreting it, has thus been guaranteed.

than 

If in care we have arrived at Dasein’s primordial state of Being, then this
must  also  be  the  basis  for  conceptualizing  that  understanding  of  Being
which lies in care; that is to say, it must be possible to define the meaning of
Being.  But  is  the  phenomenon  of  care  one  in  which  the  most  primordial
existential-ontological  state  of  Dasein  is  disclosed?  And  has  the  structural
manifoldness  which  lies  in  this  phenomenon,  presented  us  with  the  most
primordial  totality  of  factical  Dasein’s  Being?  Has  our  investigation  up  to
this point ever brought Dasein into view as a whole?

H. 231

WHAT have we gained by our preparatory analysis of Dasein, and what
are we seeking? In Being-in-the-world, whose essential structures centre in
disclosedness, we have found the basic state of the entity we have taken as
our  theme.  The  totality  of  Being-in-the-world  as  a  structural  whole  has
revealed  itself  as  care.  In  care  the  Being  of  Dasein  is  included.  When  we
came  to  analyse  this  Being,  we  took  as  our  clue  existence(i),  which,  in
anticipation,  we  had  designated  as  the  essence  of  Dasein.  This  term
“existence”  formally 
is  as  an  understanding
potentiality-for-Being,  which,  in  its  Being,  makes  an  issue  of  that  Being
itself.  In  every  case,  I  myself  am  the  entity  which  is  in  such  a  manner
[dergestalt seiend]. By working out the phenomenon of care, we have given
ourselves an insight into the concrete constitution of existence—that is, an
insight  into  its  equiprimordial  connection  with  Dasein’s  facticity  and  its
falling.

that  Dasein 

indicates 

What we are seeking is the answer to the question about the meaning of
Being  in  general,  and,  prior  to  that,  the  possibility  of  working  out  in  a
radical  manner  this  basic  question  of  all  ontology.  But  to  lay  bare  the
horizon within which something like Being in general becomes intelligible,
is  tantamount  to  clarifying  the  possibility  of  having  any  understanding  of
Being  at  all—an  understanding  which  itself  belongs  to  the  constitution  of
the  entity  called  Dasein.(ii)  The  understanding  of  Being,  however,  cannot

be radically clarified  as an essential  element in  Dasein’s Being,  unless the
entity to whose Being it belongs, has been Interpreted primordially in itself
with regard to its Being.

Are we entitled to the claim that in characterizing Dasein ontologically
qua care we have given a primordial Interpretation of this entity? By what
criterion  is  the  existential  analytic  of  Dasein  to  be  assessed  as  regards  its
primordiality,  or  the  lack  of  it?  What,  indeed,  do  we  mean  by  the
“primordiality” of an ontological Interpretation?

Ontological  investigation  is  a  possible  kind  of  interpreting,  which  we
have  described  as  the  working-out  and  appropriation  of  an  understanding.
(iii)  Every  interpretation  has  its  fore-having,  its  fore-sight,  and  its  fore-
conception. If such an interpretation, as Interpretation, becomes an explicit
task for research, then the totality of these ‘presuppositions’ (which we call
the  “hermeneutical  Situation”)  needs  to  be  clarified  and  made  secure
beforehand, both in a basic experience of the ‘object’ to be disclosed, and in
terms of such an experience. In ontological Interpretation an entity is to be
laid  bare  with  regard  to  its  own  state  of  Being;  such  an  Interpretation
obliges us first to give a phenomenal characterization of the entity we have
taken as our theme, and thus to bring it into the scope of our fore-having,
with which all the subsequent steps of our analysis are to conform. But at
the  same  time  these  steps  need  to  be  guided  by  whatever  fore-sight  is
possible  as  to  the  kind  of  Being  which  the  entity  may  possess.  Our  fore-
having and our fore-sight will then give us at the same time a sketch of that
way of conceiving (or fore-conception) to the level of which all structures
of Being are to be raised.

If, however, the ontological Interpretation is to be a primordial one, this
not  only  demands  that  in  general  the  hermeneutical  Situation  shall  be  one
which  has  been  made  secure  in  conformity  with  the  phenomena;  it  also
requires explicit assurance that the whole of the entity which it has taken as
its theme has been brought into the fore-having. Similarly, it is not enough
just to make a first sketch of the Being of this entity, even if our sketch is

grounded  in  the  phenomena.  If  we  are  to  have  a  fore-sight  of  Being,  we
must see it in such a way as not to miss the unity of those structural items
which  belong  to  it  and  are  possible.  Only  then  can  the  question  of  the
meaning of the unity which belongs to the whole entity’s totality of Being,
be formulated and answered with any phenomenal assurance.

Has the existential analysis of Dasein which we have carried out, arisen
from  such  a  hermeneutical  Situation  as  will  guarantee  the  primordiality
which fundamental ontology demands? Can we progress from the result we
have  obtained—that  the  being  of  Dasein  is  care—to  the  question  of  the
primordial unity of this structural whole?
 

iii. Cf. Section 32, H. 148 ff.

H. 233

 

What is the status of the fore-sight by which our ontological procedure
has  hitherto  been  guided?  We  have  defined  the  idea  of  existence  as  a
potentiality-for-Being—a potentiality which understands, and for which its
own  Being  is  an  issue.  But  this  potentiality-for-Being,  as  one  which  is  in
each case mine, is  free  either  for  authenticity  or for  inauthenticity or for  a
mode in which neither of these has been differentiated.(iv) In starting with
average  everydayness,  our  Interpretation  has  heretofore  been  confined  to
the analysis of such existing as is either undifferentiated or inauthentic. Of
course even along this path, it was possible and indeed necessary to reach a
concrete determination  of the  existentiality of existence. Nevertheless, our
ontological  characterization  of  the  constitution  of  existence  still  lacked
something  essential.  “Existence”  means  a  potentiality-for-Being—but  also
one which is authentic. As long as the existential structure of an authentic
potentiality-for-Being  has  not  been  brought  into  the  idea  of  existence,  the
fore-sight  by  which  an  existential  Interpretation  is  guided  will  lack
primordiality.

And  how  about  what  we  have  had  in  advance  in  our  hermeneutical
Situation  hitherto?  How  about  its  fore-having?  When  and  how  has  our
existential  analysis  received  any  assurance 
that  by  starting  with
everydayness,  it  has  forced  the  whole  of  Dasein—this  entity  from  its
‘beginning’  to  its  ‘end’—into  the  phenomenological  view  which  gives  us
our  theme?  We  have  indeed  contended  that  care  is  the  totality  of  the

structural  whole  of  Dasein’s  constitution.(v)  But  have  we  not  at  the  very
outset  of  our  Interpretation  renounced  the  possibility  of  bringing  Dasein
into  view  as  a  whole?  Everydayness  is  precisely  that  Being  which  is
‘between’ birth and death. And if existence is definitive for Dasein’s Being
and  if  its  essence  is  constituted  in  part  by  potentiality-for-Being,  then,  as
long as Dasein exists, it must in each case, as such a potentiality, not yet be
something. Any entity whose Essence is made up of existence, is essentially
opposed to the possibility of our getting it in our grasp as an entity which is
a  whole.  Not  only  has  the  hermeneutical  Situation  hitherto  given  us  no
assurance  of  ‘having’  the  whole  entity:  one  may  even  question  whether
“having”  the  whole  entity  is  attainable  at  all,  and  whether  a  primordial
ontological Interpretation of Dasein will not founder on the kind of Being
which belongs to the very entity we have taken as our theme.

One  thing has become unmistakable: our existential  analysis  of  Dasein
up till now cannot lay claim to primordiality. Its fore-having never included
more  than  the  inauthentic  Being  of  Dasein,  and  of  Dasein  as  less  than  a
whole [als unganzes]. If  the  Interpretation  of Dasein’s Being  is  to  become
primordial, as a foundation for working out the basic question of ontology,
then it must first have brought to light existentially the Being of Dasein in
its possibilities of authenticity and totality.

v. Cf. Section 41, H. 191 ff.

H. 234

 

Thus  arises  the  task  of  putting  Dasein  as  a  whole  into  our  fore-having.
This  signifies,  however,  that  we  must  first  of  all  raise  the  question  of  this
entity’s  potentiality-for-Being-a-whole.  As  long  as  Dasein  is,  there  is  in
every  case  something  still  outstanding,  which  Dasein  can  be  and  will  be.
But to that which is thus outstanding, the ‘end’ itself belongs. The ‘end’ of
Being-in-the-world is death. This end, which belongs to the potentiality-for-
Being—that  is  to  say,  to  existence—limits  and  determines  in  every  case
whatever totality is possible for Dasein. If, however, Dasein’s Being-at-an-
end(1) in death, and therewith its Being-a-whole, are to be included in the
discussion of its possibly Being-a-whole, and if this is to be done in a way
which  is  appropriate  to  the  phenomena,  then  we  must  have  obtained  an

ontologically  adequate  conception  of  death—that  is  to  say  an  existential
conception of it. But as something of the character of Dasein, death is only
in  an  existentiell  Being  towards  death  [Sein  zum  Tode].  The  existential
structure of such Being proves to be the ontologically constitutive state of
Dasein’s  potentiality-for-Being-a-whole.  Thus  the  whole  existing  Dasein
allows itself to be brought into our existential fore-having. But can Dasein
also exist authentically as a whole? How is the authenticity of existence to
be determined at all, if not with regard to authentic existing? Where do we
get  our  criterion  for  this?  Manifestly,  Dasein  itself  must,  in  its  Being,
present  us  with  the  possibility  and  the  manner  of  its  authentic  existence,
unless such existence is something that can be imposed upon it ontically, or
ontologically fabricated. But an authentic potentiality-for-Being  is  attested
by the conscience. And conscience, as a phenomenon of Dasein, demands,
like  death,  a  genuinely  existential  Interpretation.  Such  an  Interpretation
leads  to  the  insight  that  Dasein  has  an  authentic  potentiality-for-Being  in
that  it  wants  to  have  a  conscience.  But  this  is  an  existentiell  possibility
which tends, from the very meaning of its Being, to be made definite in an
existentiell way by Being-towards-death.
 

1. ‘Zu-Ende-sein’. This expression is to be distinguished from ‘Sein-zum-Ende’, which we shall

translate as ‘Being-towards-the-end’.

By  pointing  out  that  Dasein  has  an  authentic  potentiality-for-Being-a-
whole, the  existential  analytic  acquires  assurance  as  to  the  constitution  of
Dasein’s primordial Being. But at the same time the authentic potentiality-
for-Being-a-whole  becomes  visible  as  a  mode  of  care.  And  therewith  the
phenomenally  adequate  ground  for  a  primordial  Interpretation  of  the
meaning of Dasein’s Being has also been assured.

But  the  primordial  ontological  basis  for’  Dasein’s  existentiality  is
temporality.  In  terms  of  temporality,  the  articulated  structural  totality  of
Dasein’s  Being  as  care  first  becomes  existentially  intelligible.  The
Interpretation  of  the  meaning  of  Dasein’s  Being  cannot  stop  with  this
demonstration.  The  existential-temporal  analysis  of  this  entity  needs  to  be
confirmed  concretely.  We  must  go  back  and  lay  bare  in  their  temporal
meaning  the  ontological  structures  of  Dasein  which  we  have  previously
obtained. Everydayness reveals itself as a mode of temporality. But by thus
recapitulating  our  preparatory  fundamental  analysis  of  Dasein,  we  will  at
the same time make the phenomenon of temporality itself more transparent.

In terms of temporality, it then becomes intelligible why Dasein is, and can
be, historical in the basis of its Being, and why, as historical, it can develop
historiology.

H. 235

 

If temporality makes up the primordial meaning of Dasein’s Being, and
if moreover this entity is one for which, in its Being, this very Being is  an
issue,  then  care  must  use  ‘time’  and  therefore  must  reckon  with  ‘time’.
‘Time-reckoning’ is developed by Dasein’s temporality. The ‘time’ which is
experienced  in  such  reckoning  is  that  phenomenal  aspect  of  temporality
which is closest to us. Out of it arises the ordinary everyday understanding
of  time.  And  this  understanding  evolves  into  the  traditional  conception  of
time.

By  casting  light  on  the  source  of  the  ‘time’  ‘in  which’  entities  within-
the-world  are  encountered—time  as  “within-time-ness”—we  shall  make
manifest  an  essential  possibility  of  the  temporalizing  of  temporality.(1)
Therewith  the  understanding  prepares  itself  for  an  even  more  primordial
temporalizing  of  temporality.  In  this(2)  is  grounded  that  understanding  of
Being which is constitutive for the Being of Dasein. Within the horizon of
time the projection of a meaning of Being in general can be accomplished.

Thus  the  investigation  comprised  in  the  division  which  lies  before  us
will  now  traverse  the  following  stages:  Dasein’s  possibility  of  Being-a-
whole,  and  Being-towards-death  (Chapter  1);  Dasein’s  attestation  of  an
authentic  potentiality-for-Being,  and  resoluteness  (Chapter  2);  Dasein’s
authentic potentiality-for-Being-a-whole, and temporality as the ontological
meaning  of  care  (Chapter  3);  temporality  and  everydayness  (Chapter  4);
temporality and historicality (Chapter 5); temporality and within-time-ness
as the source of the ordinary conception of time (Chapter 6) .(vi)
 

vi. In the nineteenth century, Søren Kierkegaard explicitly seized upon the problem of existence
as  an  existentiell  problem,  and  thought  it  through  in  a  penetrating  fashion.  But  the  existential
problematic was so alien to him that, as regards his ontology, he remained completely dominated by
Hegel and by ancient philosophy as Hegel saw it. Thus, there is more to be learned philosophically
from his ‘edifying’ writings than from his theoretical ones—with the exception of his treatise on the
concept  of  anxiety.  [Here  Heidegger  is  referring  to  the  work  generally  known  in  English  as  The
Concept of Dread.—Tr.]

‘zeitigen’ see H. 304 below.

2.  ‘In  ihr...’  It  is  not  clear  whether  the  pronoun  ‘ihr’  refers  to  ‘Zeitigung’  (‘temporalizing’)  or

46. The Seeming Impossibility of Getting Dasein’s Being-a-whole into

our Grasp Ontologically and Determining its Character
 

H. 236

THE  inadequacy  of  the  hermeneutical  Situation  from  which  the
preceding analysis of Dasein has arisen, must be surmounted. It is necessary
for us to bring the whole Dasein into our fore-having. We must accordingly
ask whether this entity, as something existing, can ever become accessible
in  its  Being-a-whole.  In  Dasein’s  very  state  of  Being,  there  are  important
reasons which seem to speak against the possibility of having it presented
[Vorgabe] in the manner required.

The possibility of this entity’s Being-a-whole is manifestly inconsistent
with  the  ontological  meaning  of  care,  and  care  is  that  which  forms  the
totality  of  Dasein’s  structural  whole.  Yet  the  primary  item  in  care  is  the
‘ahead-of-itself’,  and  this  means  that  in  every  case  Dasein  exists  for  the
sake of itself. ‘As long as it is’, right to its end, it comports itself towards its
potentiality-for-Being.  Even  when  it  still  exists  but  has  nothing  more
‘before  it’  and  has  ‘settled  [abgeschlossen]  its  account’,  its  Being  is  still
determined  by  the  ‘ahead-of-itself’.  Hopelessness,  for  instance,  does  not
tear Dasein away from its possibilities, but is only one of its own modes of
Being  towards these  possibilities.  Even  when  one  is  without  Illusions  and
‘is  ready  for  anything’  [“Gefasstsein  auf  Alles”],  here  too  the  ‘ahead-of-
itself’ lies hidden. The ‘ahead-of-itself’, as an item in the structure of care,
tells  us  unambiguously  that  in  Dasein  there  is  always  something  still
outstanding,(1) which, as a potentiality-for-Being for Dasein itself, has not
yet  become  ‘actual’.  It  is  essential  to  the  basic  constitution  of  Dasein  that
[eine  ständige
there 

is  constantly  something  still 

to  be  settled 

Unabgeschlossenheit].  Such  a  lack  of  totality  signifies  that  there  is
something still outstanding in one’s potentiality-for-Being.

1.  ‘…im  Dasein  immer  noch  etwas  aussteht...’  The  verb  ‘ausstehen’  and  the  noun  ‘Ausstand’
(which we usually translate as ‘something still outstanding’, etc.), are ordinarily used in German to
apply to a debt or a bank deposit which, from the point of view of the lender or depositor, has yet to
be repaid to him, liquidated, or withdrawn.

But  as  soon  as  Dasein  ‘exists’  in  such  a  way  that  absolutely  nothing
more  is  still  outstanding  in  it,  then  it  has  already  for  this  very  reason
become  “no-longer-Being-there” 
is
annihilated when what is still outstanding in its Being has been liquidated.
As  long  as  Dasein  is as  an  entity,  it  has  never  reached  its  ‘wholeness’.(1)
But if it gains such ‘wholeness’, this gain becomes the utter loss of Being-
in-the-world. In such a case, it can never again be experienced as an entity.

imperfection of our cognitive powers. The hindrance lies rather in the Being
of  this  entity.  That  which  cannot  ever  be  such  as  any  experience  which
pretends  to  get  Dasein  in  its  grasp  would  claim,  eludes  in  principle  any
possibility  of  getting  experienced  at  all.(2)  But  in  that  case  is  it  not  a
hopeless  undertaking  to  try  to  discern  in  Dasein  its  ontological  totality  of
Being?

1. ‘Die Behebung des Seinsausstandes besagt Vernichtung seines Seins. Solange das Dasein als
Seiendes ist, hat es seine “Gänze” nie erreicht.’ The verb ‘beheben’ is used in the sense of closing
one’s account or liquidating it by withdrawing money from the bank. The noun ‘Gänze’, which we
shall translate as ‘wholeness’, is to be distinguished from ‘Ganze’ (‘whole’, or occasionally ‘totality’)
and ‘Ganzheit’ (‘totality’).

2. ‘Was so gar nicht erst sein kann, wie ein Erfahren das Dasein zu erfassen prätendiert, entzieht

H. 237

 

We  cannot  cross  out  the  ‘ahead-of-itself’  as  an  essential  item  in  the
structure of care. But how sound are the conclusions which we have drawn
from this? Has not the impossibility of getting the whole of Dasein into our
grasp  been  inferred  by  an  argument  which  is  merely  formal?  Or  have  we
not  at  bottom  inadvertently  posited  that  Dasein  is  something  present-at-
hand, ahead of which something that is not yet present-at-hand is constantly
shoving  itself?  Have  we,  in  our  argument,  taken  “Being-not-yet”  and  the

‘ahead’  in  a  sense  that  is  genuinely  existential? Has  our  talk  of  the  ‘end’
and ‘totality’ been phenomenally appropriate to Dasein? Has the expression
‘death’ had a biological  signification  or one that is  existential-ontological,
or indeed any signification that has been adequately and surely delimited?
Have we indeed exhausted all the possibilities for making Dasein accessible
in its wholeness?

We must answer these questions before the problem of Dasein’s totality
can  be  dismissed  as  nugatory  [nichtiges].  This  question—both  the
existentiell question of whether a potentiality-for-Being-a-whole is possible,
and the existential question of the state-of-Being of ‘end’ and ‘totality’—is
one  in  which  there  lurks  the  task  of  giving  a  positive  analysis  for  some
phenomena  of  existence  which  up  till  now  have  been  left  aside.  In  the
centre  of  these  considerations  we  have  the  task  of  characterizing
ontologically  Dasein’s  Being-at-an-end  and  of  achieving  an  existential
conception of death. The investigations relating to these topics are divided
up as follows:  the  possibility of experiencing the  death of Others,  and the
possibility of getting a whole Dasein into our grasp (Section 47); that which
is  still  outstanding,  the  end,  and  totality  (Section  48);  how  the  existential
analysis of death is distinguished from other possible Interpretations of this
phenomenon  (Section  49);  a  preliminary  sketch  of  the  existential-
ontological  structure  of  death  (Section  50);  Being-towards-death  and  the
everydayness  of  Dasein  (Section  51);  everyday  Being-towards-death,  and
the  full  existential  conception  of  death  (Section  52);  an  existential
projection of an authentic Being-towards-death (Section 53).

47.  The  Possibility  of  Experiencing  the  Death  of  Others,  and  the

Possibility of Getting a Whole Dasein into our Grasp
 

When Dasein reaches its wholeness in death, it simultaneously loses the
Being  of  its  “there”.  By  its  transition  to  no-longer-Dasein  [Nichtmehr-
dasein],  it  gets  lifted  right  out  of  the  possibility  of  experiencing  this
transition and of understanding it as something experienced. Surely this sort
of  thing  is  denied  to  any  particular  Dasein  in  relation  to  itself.  But  this
makes  the  death  of  Others  more  impressive.  In  this  way  a  termination
[Beendigung] of Dasein becomes ‘Objectively’ accessible. Dasein can thus
gain  an  experience  of  death,  all  the  more  so  because  Dasein  is  essentially

Being  with  Others.  In  that  case,  the  fact  that  death  has  been  thus
‘Objectively’  given  must  make  possible  an  ontological  delimitation  of
Dasein’s totality.

H. 238

 

Thus from the kind of Being which Dasein possesses as Being with one
another, we might draw the fairly obvious information that when the Dasein
of Others has come to an end, it might be chosen as a substitute theme for
our  analysis  of  Dasein’s  totality.  But  does  this  lead  us  to  our  appointed
goal?

Even the Dasein of Others, when it has reached its wholeness in death, is
no-longer-Dasein,  in  the  sense  of  Being-no-longer-in-the-world.  Does  not
dying  mean  going-out-of-the-world,  and  losing  one’s  Being-in-the-world?
Yet  when  someone  has  died,  his  Being-no-longer-in-the-world  (if  we
understand  it  in  an  extreme  way)  is  still  a  Being,  but  in  the  sense  of  the
Being-just-present-at-hand-and-no-more  of  a  corporeal  Thing  which  we
encounter.  In  the  dying  of  the  Other  we  can  experience  that  remarkable
phenomenon  of  Being  which  may  be  defined  as  the  change-over  of  an
entity from Dasein’s kind of Being (or life) to no-longer-Dasein. The end of
the  entity  qua  Dasein  is  the  beginning  of  the  same  entity  qua  something
present-at-hand.

However,  in  this  way  of  Interpreting  the  change-over  from  Dasein  to
Being-just-present-at-hand-and-no-more, the phenomenal content is missed,
inasmuch  as  in  the  entity  which  still  remains  we  are  not  presented  with  a
mere  corporeal  Thing.  From  a  theoretical  point  of  view,  even  the  corpse
which  is  present-at-hand  is  still  a  possible  object  for  the  student  of
pathological anatomy, whose understanding tends to be oriented to the idea
of life. This something which is just-present-at-hand-and-no-more is ‘more’
than a lifeless material Thing. In it we encounter something unalive, which
has lost its life.(1)

But  even  this  way  of  characterizing  that  which  still  remains  [des
Nochverbleibenden]  does  not  exhaust  the  full  phenomenal  findings  with
regard to Dasein.

The  ‘deceased’  [Der  “Verstorbene”]  as  distinct  from  the  dead  person
[dem  Gestorbenen],  has  been  torn  away  from  those  who  have  ‘remained
behind’ [den “Hinterbliebenen”], and is an object of ‘concern’ in the ways

of funeral rites, interment, and the cult of graves. And that is so because the
deceased,  in  his  kind  of  Being,  is  ‘still  more’  than  just  an  item  of
equipment,  environmentally  ready-to-hand,  about  which  one  can  be
their  mourning  and
concerned. 
commemoration, those who have remained behind are with him, in a mode
of  respectful  solicitude.  Thus  the  relationship-of-Being  which  one  has
towards  the  dead  is  not  to  be  taken  as  a  concernful  Being-alongside
something ready-to-hand.

In

In  such  Being-with  the  dead  [dem  Toten],  the  deceased  himself  is  no
longer  factically  ‘there’.  However,  when  we  speak  of  “Being-with”,  we
always  have  in  view  Being  with  one  another  in  the  same  world.  The
deceased has abandoned our ‘world’ and left it behind. But in terms of that
world [Aus ihr her] those who remain can still be with him.

The greater the phenomenal appropriateness with which we take the no-
longer-Dasein  of  the  deceased,  the  more  plainly  is  it  shown  that  in  such
Being-with 
Being-come-to-an-end
[Zuendegekommensein] of the deceased is precisely the sort of thing which
we do not experience.  Death does indeed reveal itself as a loss, but  a loss
such as is experienced by those who remain. In suffering this loss, however,
we have no way of access to the loss-of-Being as such which the dying man
‘suffers’.  The  dying  of  Others  is  not  something  which  we  experience  in  a
genuine sense; at most we are always just ‘there alongside’.(2)

2.  ‘…sind...  “dabei”.’  Literally  the  verb  ‘dabeisein’  means  simply  ‘to  be  at  that  place’,  ‘to  be
there alongside’; but it also has other connotations which give an ironical touch to this passage, for it
may also mean, ‘to be engaged in’ some activity, ‘to be at it’, ‘to be in the swim’, ‘to be ready to be
“counted in” ’.

And even if, by thus Being there alongside, it were possible and feasible
for us to make plain to ourselves ‘psychologically’ the dying of Others, this
would by no means let us grasp the way-to-be which we would then have in
mind—namely,  coming-to-an-end.  We  are  asking  about  the  ontological
meaning  of  the  dying  of  the  person  who  dies,  as  a  possibility-of-Being

which belongs to his Being. We are not asking about the way in which the
deceased has Dasein-with or is still-a-Dasein [Nochdaseins] with those who
are left behind. If death as experienced in Others is what we are enjoined to
take as the theme for our analysis of Dasein’s end and totality, this cannot
give us, either ontically or ontologically, what it presumes to give.

But  above  all,  the  suggestion  that  the  dying  of  Others  is  a  substitute
theme for the ontological analysis of Dasein’s totality and the settling of its
account, rests on a presupposition which demonstrably fails altogether(1) to
recognize Dasein’s kind of Being. This is what one presupposes when one
is of the opinion that any Dasein may be substituted for another at random,
so that what cannot be experienced in one’s own Dasein is accessible in that
of a stranger. But is this presupposition actually so baseless?

Indisputably, the  fact that one Dasein  can be represented(2) by  another
belongs to its possibilities of Being in Being-with-one-another in the world.
In  everyday  concern,  constant  and  manifold  use  is  made  of  such
representability. Whenever we go anywhere or have anything to contribute,
we can be represented by someone within the range of that ‘environment’
with which we are most closely concerned. The great multiplicity of ways
of Being-in-the-world  in  which one person  can be represented  by another,
not  only  extends  to  the  more  refined  modes  of  publicly  being  with  one
another, but is likewise germane to those possibilities of concern which are
restricted within definite ranges, and which are cut to the measure of one’s
occupation, one’s social status, or one’s age. But the very meaning of such
representation is such that it is always a representation ‘in’ [“in” und “bei”]
something—that  is  to  say,  in  concerning  oneself  with  something.  But
proximally  and  for  the  most  part  everyday  Dasein  understands  itself  in
terms  of  that  with  which  it  is  customarily  concerned.  ‘One  is’  what  one
does.  In  relation  to  this  sort  of  Being  (the  everyday  manner  in  which  we
join  with  one  another  in  absorption  in  the  ‘world’  of  our  concern)
representability  is  not  only  quite  possible  but  is  even  constitutive  for  our
being with one another. Here one Dasein can and must, within certain 
limits, ‘be’ another Dasein.
 

1. ‘…eine völlige Verkennung...’ The older editions have ‘totale’ rather than ‘völlige’.
2.  ‘Vertretbarkeit’.  The  verb  ‘vertreten’  means  ‘to  represent’  in  the  sense  of  ‘deputizing’  for
someone. It should be noted that the verb ‘vorstellen’ is also sometimes translated as ‘to represent’,
but in the quite different sense of ‘affording a “representation” or “idea” of something’.

H. 240

 

However, this possibility of representing breaks down completely if the
issue  is  one  of  representing  that  possibility-of-Being  which  makes  up
Dasein’s coming to an end, and which, as such, gives to it its wholeness. No
one can take the Other’s dying away from him. Of course someone can ‘go
to his death for another’. But that always means to sacrifice oneself for the
Other ‘in some definite affair’. Such “dying for” can never signify that the
Other has thus had his death taken away in even the slightest degree. Dying
is something that every Dasein itself must take upon itself at the time. By its
very  essence,  death  is  in  every  case  mine,  in  so  far  as  it  ‘is’  at  all.  And
indeed  death  signifies  a  peculiar  possibility-of-Being  in  which  the  very
Being of one’s own Dasein is an issue. In dying, it is shown that mineness
and  existence  are  ontologically  constitutive  for  death.(i)  Dying  is  not  an
event;  it  is  a  phenomenon  to  be  understood  existentially;  and  it  is  to  be
understood in a distinctive sense which must be still more closely delimited.
But  if  ‘ending’,  as  dying,  is  constitutive  for  Dasein’s  totality,  then  the
Being  of  this  wholeness  itself  must  be  conceived  as  an  existential
phenomenon of a Dasein which is in each case one’s own. In ‘ending’, and
in Dasein’s Being-a-whole, for which such ending is constitutive, there is,
by  its  very  essence,  no  representing.  These  are  the  facts  of  the  case
existentially; one fails to recognize this when one interposes the expedient
of making the dying of Others a substitute theme for the analysis of totality.
So once again the attempt to make Dasein’s Being-a-whole accessible in
a  way  that  is  appropriate  to  the  phenomena,  has  broken  down.  But  our
deliberations  have  not  been  negative  in  their  outcome;  they  have  been
oriented by the phenomena, even if only rather roughly. We have indicated
that  death  is  an  existential  phenomenon.  Our  investigation  is  thus  forced
into  a  purely  existential  orientation  to  the  Dasein  which  is  in  every  case
one’s  own.  The  only  remaining  possibility  for  the  analysis  of  death  as
dying, is either to form a purely existential conception of this phenomenon,
or else to forgo any ontological understanding of it.

H. 241

 

When  we  characterized  the  transition  from  Dasein  to  no-longer-Dasein
as  Being-no-longer-in-the-world,  we  showed  further  that  Dasein’s  going-
out-of-the-world  in  the  sense  of  dying  must  be  distinguished  from  the
going-out-of-the-world of that which merely has life [des Nur-lebenden]. In
our  terminology  the  ending  of  anything  that  is  alive,  is  denoted  as
“perishing” [Verenden]. We can see the difference only if the kind of ending
which Dasein can have is distinguished from the end of a life.(ii) Of course
“dying” may also be taken physiologically and biologically. But the medical
concept of the ‘exitus’ does not coincide with that of “perishing”.

From  the  foregoing  discussion  of  the  ontological  possibility  of  getting
death into our grasp, it becomes clear at the same time that substructures of
entities  with  another  kind  of  Being  (presence-at-hand  or  life)  thrust
themselves  to  the  fore  unnoticed,  and  threaten  to  bring  confusion  to  the
Interpretation  of  this  phenomenon—even  to  the  first  suitable  way  of
presenting it. We can encounter this phenomenon only by seeking, for our
further analysis, an ontologically adequate way of defining the phenomena
which are constitutive for it, such as “end” and “totality”.
 

ii. Cf. Section 10, H. 45 ff.

48. That which is Still Outstanding; the End; Totality

 

the 

Within 

framework  of 

investigation,  our  ontological
this 
characterization of the end and totality can be only provisional. To perform
this task adequately, we must not only set forth the formal structure of end
in  general  and  of  totality  in  general;  we  must  likewise  disentangle  the
structural variations which are possible for them in different realms—that is
to  say,  deformalized  variations  which  have  been  put  into  relationship
respectively  with  definite  kinds  of  entities  as  ‘subject-matter’,  and  which
have had their character Determined in terms of the Being of these entities.
This task, in turn, presupposes that a sufficiently unequivocal and positive
Interpretation  shall  have  been  given  for  the  kinds  of  Being  which  require
that the aggregate of entities be divided into such realms. But if we are to
understand  these  ways  of  Being,  we  need  a  clarified  idea  of  Being  in
general.  The  task  of  carrying  out  in  an  appropriate  way  the  ontological
analysis of end and totality breaks down not only because the theme is so

far-reaching, but because there is a difficulty in principle: to master this task
successfully, we must presuppose that precisely what we are seeking in this
investigation—the  meaning  of  Being  in  general—is  something  which  we
have found already and with which we are quite familiar.

H. 242

 

In the following considerations, the ‘variations’ in which we are chiefly
interested are those of end and totality; these are ways in which Dasein gets
a  definite  character  ontologically,  and  as  such  they  should  lead  to  a
primordial  Interpretation  of  this  entity.  Keeping  constantly  in  view  the
existential  constitution  of  Dasein  already  set  forth,  we  must  try  to  decide
how inappropriate to Dasein ontologically are those conceptions of end and
totality which first thrust themselves to the fore, no matter how categorially
indefinite  they  may  remain.  The  rejection  [Zurückweisung]  of  such
concepts  must  be  developed  into  a  positive  assignment  [Zuweisung]  of
them  to  their  specific  realms.  In  this  way  our  understanding  of  end  and
totality in their variant forms as existentialia will be strengthened, and this
will guarantee the possibility of an ontological Interpretation of death.

But even if the analysis of Dasein’s end and totality takes on so broad an
orientation, this cannot mean that the existential concepts of end and totality
are  to  be  obtained  by  way  of  a  deduction.  On  the  contrary,  the  existential
meaning  of  Dasein’s  coming-to-an-end  must  be  taken  from  Dasein  itself,
and we must show how such ‘ending’ can constitute Being-a-whole for the
entity which exists.

We may formulate in three theses the discussion of death up to this point:
1. there belongs to Dasein, as long as it is, a “not-yet” which it will be—that
which is constantly still outstanding; (2). the coming-to-its-end of what-is-
not-yet-at-an-end (in which what is still outstanding is liquidated as regards
its  Being)  has  the  character  of  no-longer-Dasein;  3.  coming-to-an-end
implies  a  mode  of  Being  in  which  the  particular  Dasein  simply  cannot  be
represented by someone else.

In Dasein there is undeniably a constant ‘lack of totality’ which finds an
end  with  death.  This  “not-yet”  ‘belongs’  to  Dasein  as  long  as  it  is;  this  is
how  things  stand  phenomenally.  Is  this  to  be  Interpreted  as  still
outstanding?(1) With relation to what entities do we talk about that which is
still outstanding? When we use this expression we have in view that which

indeed ‘belongs’ to an entity, but is still missing. Outstanding, as a way of
being  missing,  is  grounded  upon  a  belonging-to.(2)  For  instance,  the
remainder  yet  to  be  received  when  a  debt  is  to  be  balanced  off,  is  still
outstanding.  That  which  is  still  outstanding  is  not  yet  at  one’s  disposal.
When the ‘debt’ gets paid off, that which is still outstanding gets liquidated;
this  signifies  that  the  money  ‘comes  in’,  or,  in  other  words,  that  the
remainder  comes  successively  along.  By  this  procedure  the  “not-yet”  gets
filled  up,  as  it  were,  until  the  sum  that  is  owed  is  “all  together”.(3)
Therefore,  to  be  still  outstanding  means  that  what  belongs  together  is  not
yet  all  together.  Ontologically,  this  implies  the  un-readiness-to-hand  of
those  portions  which  have  yet  to  be  contributed.  These  portions  have  the
same kind of Being as those which are ready-to-hand already; and the latter,
for  their  part,  do  not  have  their  kind  of  Being  modified  by  having  the
remainder  come 
in.  Whatever  “lack-of-togetherness”  remains  [Das
bestehende Unzusammen] gets “paid off’ by a cumulative piecing-together.
Entities  for  which  anything  is  still  outstanding  have  the  kind  of  Being  of
something 
is
characterized  as  a  “sum”,  and  so  is  that  lack-of-togetherness  which  is
founded upon it.

[Das  Zusammen] 

togetherness 

1.  ‘Aber  darf  der  phänomenale  Tatbestand,  dass  zum  Dasein,  solange  es  ist,  dieses  Noch-nicht
“gehört”,  als  Ausstand  interpretiert  werden?’  The  contrast  between  ‘Tatbestand’  and  ‘Ausstand’  is
perhaps intentional.

2. ‘Ausstehen ala Fehlen gründet in einer Zugehörigkeit.’
3.  ‘Tilgung  der  “Schuld”  als  Behebung  des  Ausstandes  bedeutet  das  “Eingehen”,  das  ist
Nacheinanderankommen  des  Restes,  wodurch  das  Noch-nicht  gleichsam  aufgefüllt  wird,  bis  die
geschuldete Summe “beisammen” ist.’ On ‘Schuld’ see note 1, H. 280.

H. 243

 

But  this  lack-of-togetherness  which  belongs  to  such  a  mode  of
togetherness—this  being-missing  as  still-outstanding—cannot  by  any
means  define  ontologically  that  “not-yet”  which  belongs  to  Dasein  as  its
possible death. Dasein does not have at all the kind of Being of something
ready-to-hand-within-the-world.  The  togetherness  of  an  entity  of  the  kind
which  Dasein  is  ‘in  running  its  course’  until  that  ‘course’  has  been
completed, is not constituted by a ‘continuing’ piecing-on of entities which,
somehow and somewhere, are ready-to-hand already in their own right.(1)
 

1. Throughout this sentence Heidegger uses words derived from the verb ‘laufen’, ‘to run’. Thus,
‘in running its course’ represents ‘in seinem Verlauf’, ‘ “its course” has been completed’ represents
‘es “seinem Lauf” vollendet hat’; ‘continuing’ represents ‘fortlaufende’.

That  Dasein should be together  only  when  its “not-yet”  has been filled
up is so far from the case that it is precisely then that Dasein is no longer.
Any Dasein always exists in just such a manner that its “not-yet” belongs to
it. But are there not entities which are as they are and to which a “not-yet”
can belong, but which do not necessarily have Dasein’s kind of Being?

For instance, we  can say, “The last  quarter is  still  outstanding until  the
moon  gets  full”.  The  “not-yet”  diminishes  as  the  concealing  shadow
disappears. But here the moon is always present-at-hand as a whole already.
Leaving aside the fact that we can never get the moon wholly in our grasp
even  when  it  is  full,  this  “not-yet”  does  not  in  any  way  signify  a  not-yet-
Being-together of the parts which belongs to the moon, but pertains only to
the way we get it in our grasp perceptually. The “not-yet” which belongs to
Dasein,  however,  is  not  just  something  which  is  provisionally  and
occasionally  inaccessible  to  one’s  own  experience  or  even  to  that  of  a
stranger;  it  ‘is’  not  yet  ‘actual’  at  all.  Our  problem  does  not  pertain  to
getting into our grasp the “not-yet’ which is of the character of Dasein; it
pertains to the possible Being or not-Being of this “not-yet”. Dasein must,
as itself, become—that is to say, be—what it is not yet. Thus if we are to be
able, by comparison, to  define that Being  of  the  “not-yet”  which  is  of  the
character of Dasein, we must take into consideration entities to whose kind
of Being becoming belongs.

H. 244

 

When,  for  instance,  a  fruit  is  unripe,  it  “goes  towards”  its  ripeness.  In
this  process  of  ripening,  that  which  the  fruit  is  not  yet,  is  by  no  means
pieced  on  as  something  not  yet  present-at-hand.  The  fruit  brings  itself  to
ripeness,  and  such  a  bringing  of  itself  is  a  characteristic  of  its  Being  as  a
fruit. Nothing imaginable which one might contribute to it, would eliminate
the unripeness of the fruit, if this entity did not come to ripeness of its own
accord. When we speak of the “not-yet” of the unripeness, we do not have
in view something else which stands outside [aussenstehendes], and which
—with  utter  indifference  to  the  fruit—might  be  present-at-hand  in  it  and
with it. What we have in view is the fruit itself in its specific kind of Being.

The  sum  which  is  not  yet  complete  is,  as  something  ready-to-  hand,  ‘a
matter  of  indifference’  as  regards  the  remainder  which  is  lacking  and  un-
ready-to-hand,  though,  taken  strictly,  it  can  neither  be  indifferent  to  that
remainder  nor  not  be  indifferent  to  it.(1)  The  ripening  fruit,  however,  not
only is not indifferent to its unripeness as something other than itself, but it
is  that  unripeness  as  it  ripens.  The  “not-yet”  has  already  been  included  in
the  very  Being  of  the  fruit,  not  as  some  random  characteristic,  but  as
something constitutive. Correspondingly, as long as any Dasein is, it too is
already its “not-yet”.(iii)

That  which  makes  up  the  ‘lack  of  totality’  in  Dasein,  the  constant
“ahead-of-itself”,  is  neither  something  still  outstanding  in  a  summative
togetherness,  nor  something  which  has  not  yet  become  accessible.  It  is  a
“not-yet”  which  any  Dasein,  as  the  entity  which  it  is,  has  to  be.
Nevertheless,  the  comparison  with  the  unripeness  of  the  fruit  shows
essential differences, although there is a certain agreement. If we take note
of  these  differences,  we  shall  recognize  how  indefinite  our  talk  about  the
end and ending has hitherto been.

Ripening is the specific Being of the fruit. It is also a kind of Being of
the  “not-yet”  (of  unripeness);  and,  as  such  a  kind  of  Being,  it  is  formally
analogous  to  Dasein,  in  that  the  latter,  like  the  former,  is  in  every  case
already its “not-yet” in a sense still to be defined. But even then, this does
not  signify  that  ripeness  as  an  ‘end’  and  death  as  an  ‘end’  coincide  with
regard to their ontological structure as ends. With ripeness, the fruit fulfils
itself.(2) But is the death at which Dasein arrives, a fulfilment in this sense?
With its death, Dasein has indeed ‘fulfilled its course’. But in doing so, has
it  necessarily  exhausted  its  specific  possibilities?  Rather,  are  not  these
precisely  what  gets  taken  away  from  Dasein?  Even  ‘unfulfilled’  Dasein
ends.  On  the  other  hand,  so  little  is  it  the  case  that  Dasein  comes  to  its
ripeness  only  with  death,  that  Dasein  may  well  have  passed  its  ripeness
before the end.(3) For the most part, Dasein ends in unfulfilment, or else by
having disintegrated and been used up.
 

iii. The distinction between a whole and a sum, ὅλον and πᾶν, totum and compositum, has  been
familiar since the time of Plato and Aristotle. But admittedly no one as yet knows anything about the
systematics  of  the  categorial  variations  which  this  division  already  embraces,  nor  have  these  been
conceptualized.  As  an  approach  to  a  thorough  analysis  of  the  structures  in  question,  cf.  Edmund
Husserl,  Logische  Untersuchungen,  vol.  II,  Untersuchung  III:  ‘Zur  Lehre  von  den  Ganzen  und
Teilen’.
 

1.  ‘Die  noch  nicht  volle  Summe  ist  als  Zuhandenes  gegen  den  fehlenden  unzuhandenen  Rest

“gleichgültig”. Streng genommen kann sie weder ungleichgültig, noch gleichgültig dagegen sein.’

2.  ‘Mit  der  Reife  vollendet  sich  die  Frucht.’  Notice  that  the  verb  ‘vollenden’,  which  we  here
translate as ‘fulfil’, involves the verb ‘enden’ (‘to end’). While ‘vollenden’ may mean ‘to bring fully
to an end’ or ‘to terminate’, it may also mean ‘to complete’ or ‘to perfect’.

3.  While  we  have  translated  ‘Reife’  by  its  cognate  ‘ripeness’,  this  word  applies  generally  to

almost any kind of maturity, even that of Dasein—not merely the maturity of fruits and vegetables.

Ending  does  not  necessarily  mean  fulfilling  oneself.  It  thus  becomes
more  urgent  to  ask  in  what  sense,  if  any,  death  must  be  conceived  as  the
ending of Dasein.

H. 245

 

In the first instance, “ending” signifies “stopping”, and it signifies this in
senses  which  are  ontologically  different.  The  rain  stops.  It  is  no  longer
present-at-hand.  The  road  stops.  Such  an  ending  does  not  make  the  road
disappear,  but  such  a  stopping  is  determinative  for  the  road  as  this  one,
which  is  present-at-hand.  Hence  ending,  as  stopping,  can  signify  either
“passing  over  into  non-presence-at-hand”  or  else  “Being-present-at-hand
only when the end comes”. The latter kind of ending, in turn, may either be
determinative for something which is present-at-hand in an unfinished way,
as a road breaks off when one finds it under construction; or it may rather
constitute  the  ‘finishedness”  of  something  present-at-hand,  as  the  painting
is finished with the last stroke of the brush.

But ending as “getting finished” does not include fulfilling. On the other
hand,  whatever  has  got  to  be  fulfilled  must  indeed  reach  the  finishedness
that is possible for it. Fulfilling is a mode of ‘finishedness’, and is founded
upon  it.  Finishedness  is  itself  possible  only  as  a  determinate  form  of
something present-at-hand or ready-to-hand.

Even  ending  in  the  sense  of  “disappearing”  can  still  have  its
modifications according to the kind of Being which an entity may have. The
rain is at an end—that is to say it has disappeared. The bread is at an end—
that is to say, it has been used up and is no longer available as something
ready-to-hand.

By none of these modes of ending can death be suitably characterized as
the “end” of Dasein. If dying, as Being-at-an-end, were understood in the
sense  of  an  ending  of  the  kind  we  have  discussed,  then  Dasein  would
thereby be treated as something present-at-hand or ready-to-hand. In death,

Dasein  has  not  been  fulfilled  nor  has  it  simply  disappeared;  it  has  not
become  finished  nor  is  it  wholly  at  one’s  disposal  as  something  ready-to-
hand.

On  the  contrary,  just  as  Dasein  is already  its  “not-yet”,  and  is  its  “not-
yet” constantly as long as it is, it is already its end too. The “ending” which
we have in view when we speak of death, does not signify Dasein’s Being-
at-an-end [Zu-Ende-sein], but a Being-towards-the-end [Sein zum Ende] of
this entity. Death is a way to be, which Dasein takes over as soon as it is.
“As soon as man comes to life, he is at once old enough to die.’(iv)

Ending,  as  Being-towards-the-end,  must  be  clarified  ontologically  in
terms  of  Dasein’s  kind  of  Being.  And  presumably  the  possibility  of  an
existent  Being  of  that  “not-yet”  which  lies  ‘before’  the  ‘end’,(1)  will
become  intelligible  only  if  the  character  of  ending  has  been  determined
existentially.  The  existential  clarification  of  Being-towards-the-end  will
also  give  us  for  the  first  time  an  adequate  basis  for  defining  what  can
possibly be the meaning of our talk about a totality of Dasein, if indeed this
totality is to be constituted by death as the ‘end’.

Our  attempt  to  understand  Dasein’s  totality  by  taking  as  our  point  of
departure a clarification of the “not-yet” and going on to a characterization
of “ending”, has not led us to our goal. It has shown only in a negative way
that  the  “not-yet”  which  Dasein  in  every  case  is,  resists  Interpretation  as
something  still  outstanding.  The  end  towards  which Dasein is  as  existing,
remains  inappropriately  defined  by  the  notion  of  a  “Being-at-an-end”.
These considerations, however, should at the same time make it plain that
they must be turned back in their course. A positive characterization of the
phenomena  in  question  (Being-not-yet,  ending,  totality)  succeeds  only
when it is unequivocally oriented to Dasein’s state of Being. But if we have
any  insight  into  the  realms  where  those  end-structures  and  totality-

structures which are to be construed ontologically with Dasein belong, this
will,  in  a  negative  way,  make  this  unequivocal  character  secure  against
wrong turnings.

If we are to carry out a positive Interpretation of death and its character
as an end, by way of existential analysis, we must take as our clue the basic
state of Dasein at which we have already arrived—the phenomenon of care.

49. How the Existential Analysis of Death is Distinguished from Other

Possible Interpretations of this Phenomenon
 

The  unequivocal  character  of  our  ontological  Interpretation  of  death
must first be strengthened by our bringing explicitly to mind what such an
Interpretation can not inquire about, and what it would be vain to expect it
to give us any information or instructions about.(1)
 

1. ‘…wonach diese nicht fragen, und worüber eine Auskunft und Anweisung von ihr vergeblich
erwartet werden kann.’ The older editions have ‘k a n n’ after ‘fragen’, and ‘muss’ where the newer
editions have ‘kann’.

Death,  in  the  widest  sense,  is  a  phenomenon  of  life.  Life  must  be
understood as a kind of Being to which there belongs a Being-in-the-world.
Only if this kind of Being is oriented in a privative way to Dasein, can we
fix  its  character  ontologically.  Even  Dasein  may  be  considered  purely  as
life.  When  the  question  is  formulated  from  the  viewpoint  of  biology  and
physiology, Dasein moves into that domain of Being which we know as the
world of animals and plants. In this field, we can obtain data and statistics
about  the  longevity  of  plants,  animals  and  men,  and  we  do  this  by
ascertaining  them  ontically.  Connections  between  longevity,  propagation,
and  growth  may  be  recognized.  The  ‘kinds’  of  death,  the  causes,

Underlying this biological-ontical exploration of death is  a problematic
that is ontological. We still have to ask how the ontological essence of death
is  defined  in  terms  of  that  of  life.  In  a  certain  way,  this  has  always  been
decided  already  in  the  ontical  investigation  of  death.  Such  investigations
operate  with  preliminary  conceptions  of  life  and  death,  which  have  been
more  or  less  clarified.  These  preliminary  conceptions  need  to  be  sketched
out  by  the  ontology  of  Dasein.  Within  the  ontology  of  Dasein,  which  is
superordinate to an ontology of life, the existential analysis of death is, in
turn, subordinate to a characterization of Dasein’s basic state. The ending of
that  which  lives  we  have  called  ‘perishing’.  Dasein  too  ‘has’  its  death,  of
the  kind  appropriate  to  anything  that  lives;  and  it  has  it,  not  in  ontical
isolation, but as codetermined by its primordial kind of Being. In so far as
this is the case, Dasein too can end without authentically dying, though on
the  other  hand,  qua  Dasein,  it  does  not  simply  perish.  We  designate  this
intermediate phenomenon as its “demise”.(1) Let the term “dying” stand for
that way of Being in which Dasein is towards its death.(2) Accordingly we
must say that Dasein never perishes. Dasein, however, can demise only as
long as it is dying. Medical and biological investigation into “demising” can
obtain results which may even become significant ontologically if the basic
orientation for an existential Interpretation of death has been made secure.
Or must sickness and death in general—even from a medical point of view
—be primarily conceived as existential phenomena?
 

1. ‘Ableben’. This  term,  which  literally  means  something  like  ‘living  out’  one’s  life,  is  used  in
ordinary  German  as  a  rather  legalistic  term  for  a  person’s  death.  We  shall  translate  it  as  ‘demise’
(both  as  a  noun  and  as  a  verb),  which  also  has  legalistic  connotations.  But  this  translation  is  an
arbitrary one, and does not adequately express the meaning which Heidegger is explaining.

2. ‘…Seinsweise, in der das Dasein zu seinem Tode ist.’

The existential Interpretation of death takes precedence over any biology
and  ontology  of  life.  But  it  is  also  the  foundation  for  any  investigation  of
death  which 
is  biographical  or  historiological,  ethnological  or
psychological.  In  any  ‘typology’  of  ‘dying’,  as  a  characterization  of  the
conditions under which a demise is ‘Experienced’ and of the ways in which
it is ‘Experienced’, the concept of death is already presupposed. Moreover,
a psychology of ‘dying’ gives information about the ‘living’ of the person
who is ‘dying’, rather than about dying itself. This simply reflects the fact
that  when  Dasein  dies—and  even  when  it  dies  authentically—it  does  not

have to do so with an Experience of its factical demising, or  i n   such an
Experience.  Likewise  the  ways  in  which  death  is  taken  among  primitive
peoples, and their ways of comporting themselves towards it in magic and
the
cult, 
Interpretation of this understanding already requires an existential analytic
and a corresponding conception of death.

On the other hand, in the ontological analysis of Being-towards-the-end
there is no anticipation of our taking any existentiell stand toward death. If
“death”  is  defined  as  the  ‘end’  of  Dasein—that  is  to  say,  of  Being-in-the-
world—this does not imply any ontical decision whether ‘after death’ still
another Being is possible, either higher or lower, or whether Dasein ‘lives
on’  or  even  ‘outlasts’  itself  and  is  ‘immortal’.  Nor  is  anything  decided
ontically about the ‘other-worldly’ and its possibility, any more than about
the ‘this-worldly’;(1) it is not as if norms and rules for comporting oneself
towards  death  were  to  be  proposed  for  ‘edification’.  But  our  analysis  of
death  remains  purely  ‘this-worldly’  in  so  far  as  it  Interprets  that
phenomenon merely in the way in which it enters into any particular Dasein
as  a  possibility  of  its  Being.  Only  when  death  is  conceived  in  its  full
ontological  essence  can  we  have  any  methodological  assurance  in  even
asking what may be after death; only then can we do so with meaning and
justification.  Whether  such  a  question  is  a  possible  theoretical question  at
all will not be decided here. The this-worldly ontological Interpretation of
death takes precedence over any ontical other-worldly speculation.
 

1.  ‘Über  das  “Jenseits”  und  seine  Möglichkeit  wird  ebensowenig  ontisch  entschieden  wie  über

das “Diesseits”...’ The quotation marks around “Diesseits” appear only in the later editions.

Finally,  what  might  be  discussed  under  the  topic  of  a  ‘metaphysic  of
death’ lies outside the domain of an existential analysis of death. Questions
of how and when death ‘came into the world’, what ‘meaning’ it can have
and is to have as an evil and affliction in the aggregate of entities—these are
questions  which  necessarily  presuppose  an  understanding  not  only  of  the
character  of  Being  which  belongs  to  death,  but  of  the  ontology  of  the

aggregate  of  entities  as  a  whole,  and  especially  of  the  ontological
clarification of evil and negativity in general.

Methodologically,  the  existential  analysis  is  superordinate  to  the
questions  of  a  biology,  psychology,  theodicy,  or  theology  of  death.  Taken
ontically,  the  results  of  the  analysis  show  the  peculiar  formality  and
emptiness of any ontological characterization. However, that must not blind
us  to  the  rich  and  complicated  structure  of  the  phenomenon.  If  Dasein  in
general  never  becomes  accessible  as  something  present-at-hand,  because
Being-possible belongs in its own way to Dasein’s kind of Being, even less
may  we  expect  that  we  can  simply  read  off  the  ontological  structure  of
death, if death is indeed a distinctive possibility of Dasein.

H. 249

 

On the other hand, the analysis cannot keep clinging to an idea of death
which  has  been  devised  accidentally  and  at  random.  We  can  restrain  this
arbitrariness  only  by  giving  beforehand  an  ontological  characterization  of
the  kind  of  Being  in  which  the  ‘end’  enters  into  Dasein’s  average
everydayness.  To  do  so,  we  must  fully  envisage  those  structures  of
everydayness which we have earlier set forth. The fact that in an existential
analysis  of  death,  existentiell  possibilities  of  Being-towards-death  are
consonant with it, is implied by the essence of all ontological investigation.
All  the  more  explicitly  must  the  existential  definition  of  concepts  be
unaccompanied  by  any  existentiell  commitments,(1)  especially  with
relation  to  death,  in  which  Dasein’s  character  as  possibility  lets  itself  be
revealed  most  precisely.  The  existential  problematic  aims  only  at  setting
forth the ontological structure of Dasein’s Being-towards-the-end.(vi)
 

vi. In its Interpretation of ‘life’, the anthropology worked out in Christian theology—from Paul
right up to Calvin’s meditatio futurae vitae—has always kept death in view. Wilhelm Dilthey, whose
real philosophical tendencies were aimed at an ontology of ‘life’, could not fail to recognize how life
is  connected  with  death:  ‘...and  finally,  that  relationship  which  most  deeply  and  universally
determines  the  feeling  of  our  Dasein—the  relationship  of  life  to  death;  for  the  bounding  of  our
existence by death is always decisive for our understanding and assessment of life.’ (Das Erlebnsis
und  die  Dichtung,  5th  Edition,  p.  230.)  Recently,  G.  Simmel  has  also  explicitly  included  the
phenomenon of death in his characterization of ‘life’, though admittedly without clearly separating
the biological-ontical and the ontological-existential problematics. (Cf. his Lebensanschauung: Vier
Metaphysische  Kapitel,  1918,  pp.  99-153.)  For  the  investigation  which  lies  before  us,  compare
especially Karl Jaspers’ Psychologie der Weltanschauungen, 3rd Edition, 1925, pp. 229 ff., especially
pp. 259-270. Jaspers takes as his clue to death the phenomenon of the ‘limit-situation’ as he has set it

forth—a phenomenon whose fundamental significance goes beyond any typology of ‘attitudes’ and
‘world-pictures’.

50.  Preliminary  Sketch  of  the  Existential-ontological  Structure  of

Death
 

 

H. 250

there  has  emerged 

the  necessity  of  Interpreting 

From  our  considerations  of  totality,  end,  and  that  which  is  still
outstanding, 
the
phenomenon of death as Being-towards-the-end, and of doing so in terms of
Dasein’s basic state. Only so can it be made plain to what extent Being-a-
whole, as constituted by Being towards-the-end, is possible in Dasein itself
in conformity with the structure of its Being. We have seen that care is the
basic state of Dasein. The ontological signification of the expression “care”
has  been  expressed  in  the  ‘definition’:  “ahead-of-itself-Being-already-in
(the  world)  as  Being-alongside  entities  which  we  encounter  (within-the-
world)”.(vii)  In  this  are  expressed  the  fundamental  characteristics  of
Dasein’s Being: existence, in the “ahead-of-itself”; facticity, in the “Being-
already-in”; falling, in the “Being-alongside”. If indeed death belongs in a
distinctive sense to the Being of Dasein, then death (or Being-towards-the-
end) must be defined in terms of these characteristics.

We  must,  in  the  first  instance,  make  plain  in  a  preliminary  sketch  how
the

Dasein’s  existence,  facticity,  and  falling  reveal 
phenomenon of death.

themselves 

in 

The Interpretation in which the “not-yet—and with it even the uttermost
“not-yet”,  the  end  of  Dasein—was  taken  in  the  sense  of  something  still
outstanding,  has  been  rejected  as  inappropriate  in  that  it  included  the

ontological perversion of making Dasein something present-at-hand. Being-
at-an-end implies existentially Being-towards-the-end. The uttermost “not-
yet” has the character of something towards which  Dasein comports itself.
The end is impending [steht... bevor] for Dasein. Death is not something not
yet  present-at-hand,  nor  is  it  that  which  is  ultimately  still  outstanding  but
which  has  been  reduced  to  a  minimum.  Death  is  something  that  stands
before us—something impending.(1)

However,  there  is  much  that  can  impend  for  Dasein  as  Being-in-the-
world.  The  character  of  impendence  is  not  distinctive  of  death.  On  the
contrary,  this Interpretation  could  even lead  us to  suppose that death must
be  understood  in  the  sense  of  some  impending  event  encountered
environmentally. For instance, a storm, the remodelling of the house, or the
arrival  of  a  friend,  may  be  impending;  and  these  are  entities  which  are
respectively  present-at-hand,  ready-to-hand,  and  there-with-us.  The  death
which impends does not have this kind of Being.

But there may also be impending for Dasein a journey, for instance, or a
disputation  with  Others,  or  the  forgoing  of  something  of  a  kind  which
Dasein itself can be—its own possibilities of Being, which are based on its
Being with Others.

Death  is  a  possibility-of-Being  which  Dasein  itself  has  to  take  over  in
every  case.  With  death,  Dasein  stands  before  itself  in  its  ownmost
potentiality-for-Being. This is a possibility in which the issue is nothing less
than  Dasein’s  Being-in-the-world.  Its  death  is  the  possibility  of  no-longer
being-able-to-be-there.(2) If Dasein stands before itself as this possibility, it
has  been  fully  assigned  to  its  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being.  When  it
stands  before  itself  in  this  way,  all  its  relations  to  any  other  Dasein  have
been  undone.(3)  This  ownmost  non-relational(4)  possibility  is  at  the  same
time the uttermost one.
 

vii. Cf. Section 41, H. 192.

 

1. ‘…sondern eher ein Bevorstand.’ While we shall ordinarily use various forms of ‘impend’ to
translate  ‘Bevorstand’,  ‘bevorstehen’,  etc.,  one  must  bear  in  mind  that  the  literal  meaning  of  these
expressions  is  one  of  ‘standing  before’,  so  that  they  may  be  quite  plausibly  contrasted  with
‘Ausstehen’, etc. (‘standing out’). Thus we shall occasionally use forms of ‘stand before’ when this
connotation seems to be dominant.

2. ‘Nicht-mehr-dasein-könnens.’ Notice that the expressions ‘Seinkönnen’ (our ‘potentiality-for-

Being’) and ‘Nichtmehrdasein’ (our ‘no-longer-Dasein’) are here fused. Cf. H. 237-242.

3. ‘So sich bevorstehend sind in ihm alle Bezüge zu anderem Dasein gelöst.’

4.  ‘unbezügliche’.  This  term  appears  frequently  throughout  the  chapter,  and,  as  the  present
passage makes clear, indicates that in death Dasein is cut off from relations with others. The term has
accordingly been translated as ‘non-relational’, in the sense of ‘devoid of relationships’.

H. 251

 

As potentiality-for-Being, Dasein cannot outstrip the possibility of death.
Death is the possibility of the absolute impossibility of Dasein. Thus death
reveals  itself  as  that  possibility  which  is  one’s  ownmost,  which  is  non-
relational,  and  which  is  not  to  be  outstripped  [unüberholbare].  As  such,
death  is  something  distinctively  impending.  Its  existential  possibility  is
based on the fact that Dasein is essentially disclosed to itself, and disclosed,
indeed,  as  ahead-of-itself.  This  item  in  the  structure  of  care  has  its  most
primordial  concretion  in  Being-towards-death.  As  a  phenomenon,  Being-
towards-the-end  becomes  plainer  as  Being 
that  distinctive
possibility of Dasein which we have characterized.

towards 

This  ownmost  possibility,  however,  non-relational  and  not  to  be
outstripped,  is  not  one  which  Dasein  procures  for  itself  subsequently  and
occasionally in the course of its Being. On the contrary, if Dasein exists, it
has  already  been  thrown into  this  possibility.  Dasein  does  not,  proximally
and for the most part, have any explicit or even any theoretical knowledge
of the  fact that it has been delivered  over to  its death, and that death  thus
belongs  to  Being-in-the-world.  Thrownness  into  death  reveals  itself  to
Dasein  in  a  more  primordial  and  impressive  manner  in  that  state-of-mind
which we have called “anxiety”.(viii) Anxiety in the face of death is anxiety
‘in  the  face  of’  that  potentiality-for-Being  which  is  one’s  ownmost,  non-
relational,  and  not  to  be  outstripped.  That  in  the  face  of  which  one  has
anxiety is Being-in-the-world itself. That about which one has this anxiety
is simply Dasein’s potentiality-for-Being. Anxiety in the face of death must
not be confused with fear in the face of one’s demise. This anxiety is not an
accidental  or  random  mood  of  ‘weakness’  in  some  individual;  but,  as  a
basic  state-of-mind  of  Dasein,  it  amounts  to  the  disclosedness  of  the  fact
that  Dasein  exists  as  thrown  Being  towards  its  end.  Thus  the  existential
conception of “dying” is made clear as thrown Being towards its ownmost
potentiality-for-Being,  which  is  non-relational  and  not  to  be  outstripped.
Precision is gained by distinguishing this from pure disappearance, and also
from merely perishing, and finally from the ‘Experiencing’ of a demise.(1)

H. 252

Being-towards-the-end  does not  first  arise through  some  attitude  which
occasionally  emerges,  nor  does  it  arise  as  such  an  attitude;  it  belongs
essentially  to  Dasein’s  thrownness,  which  reveals  itself  in  a  state-of-mind
(mood)  in  one  way  or  another.  The  factical  ‘knowledge’  or  ‘ignorance’
which  prevails  in  any  Dasein  as  to  its  ownmost  Being-towards-the-end,  is
only  the  expression  of  the  existentiell  possibility  that  there  are  different
ways of maintaining oneself in this Being. Factically, there are many who,
proximally  and  for  the  most  part,  do  not  know  about  death;  but  this  must
not be passed off as a ground for proving that Being-towards-death does not
belong  to  Dasein  ‘universally’.  It  only  proves  that  proximally  and  for  the
most part Dasein covers up its ownmost Being-towards-death, fleeing in the
face of it. Factically, Dasein is dying as long as it exists, but proximally and
for  the  most part,  it does so by way  of falling.  For  factical  existing  is  not
only generally and without further differentiation a thrown potentiality-for-
Being-in-the-world, but it has always likewise been absorbed in the ‘world’
of  its  concern.  In  this  falling  Being-alongside,  fleeing  from  uncanniness
announces  itself;  and  this  means  now,  a  fleeing  in  the  face  of  one’s
ownmost Being-towards-death. Existence, facticity, and falling characterize
Being-towards-the-end,  and  are  therefore  constitutive  for  the  existential
conception  of  death.  As  regards  its  ontological  possibility,  dying  is
grounded in care.

But  if  Being-towards-death  belongs  primordially  and  essentially  to
Dasein’s  Being,  then  it  must  also  be  exhibitable  in  everydayness,  even  if
proximally in a way which is inauthentic.(1) And if Being-towards-the-end
should afford the existential possibility of an existentiell Being-a-whole for
Dasein,  then  this  would  give  phenomenal  confirmation  for  the  thesis  that
“care” is the ontological term for the totality of Dasein’s structural whole.
If,  however,  we  are  to  provide  a  full  phenomenal  justification  for  this
principle,  a  preliminary  sketch  of  the  connection  between  Being-towards-
death  and  care  is  not  sufficient.  We  must  be  able  to  see  this  connection
above all in that concretion which lies closest to Dasein—its everydayness.

51. Being-towards-death and the Everydayness of Dasein

In setting forth average everyday Being-towards-death, we must take our
orientation from those structures of everydayness at which we have earlier
arrived. In Being-towards-death, Dasein comports itself towards itself  as a
distinctive  potentiality-for-Being.  But  the  Self  of  everydayness  is  the
“they”.(ix) The “they” is constituted by the way things have been publicly
interpreted, which expresses itself in idle talk.(2) Idle talk must accordingly
make  manifest  the  way  in  which  everyday  Dasein  interprets  for  itself  its
Being-towards-death.  The  foundation  of  any  interpretation  is  an  act  of
understanding, which is always accompanied by a state-of-mind, or, in other
words,  which  has  a  mood.  So  we  must  ask  how  Being-towards-death  is
disclosed by the kind of understanding which, with its state-of-mind, lurks
in  the  idle  talk  of  the  “they”.  How  does  the  “they”  comport  itself
understandingly towards that ownmost possibility of Dasein, which is non-
relational and is not to be outstripped? What state-of-mind discloses to the
“they” that it has been delivered over to death, and in what way?
 

ix. Cf. Section 27, H. 126 ff.

H. 253

 

 

In  the  publicness  with  which  we  are  with  one  another  in  our  everyday
manner, death is ‘known’ as a mishap which is constantly occurring—as a
‘case  of  death’.(3)  Someone  or  other  ‘dies’,  be  he  neighbour  or  stranger
[Nächste oder Fernerstehende].
 

1.  ‘…dann  muss  es  auch—wenngleich  zunächst  uneigentlich—in  der  Alltäglichkeit  aufweisbar

sein.’ The earlier editions have another ‘auch’ just before ‘in der Alltäglichkeit’.

2. ‘...das sich in der öffentlichen Ausgelegtheit konstituiert, die sich im Gerede ausspricht.’ The

earlier editions have ‘...konstituiert. Sie spricht sich aus im Gerede.’

3. ‘Die Öffentlichkeit des alltäglichen Miteinander “kennt” den Tod als standig vorkommendes

Begegnis, als “Todesfall”.’

People who are no acquaintances of ours are ‘dying’ daily and hourly.
‘Death’  is  encountered  as  a  well-known  event  occurring  within-the-world.
As  such  it  remains  in  the  inconspicuousness(x)  characteristic  of  what  is
encountered  in  an  everyday  fashion.  The  “they”  has  already  stowed  away
[gesichert]  an  interpretation  for  this  event.  It  talks  of  it  in  a  ‘fugitive’

manner, either expressly or else in a way which is mostly inhibited, as if to
say,  “One  of  these  days  one  will  die  too,  in  the  end;  but  right  now  it  has
nothing to do with us.”(1)

The analysis of the phrase ‘one dies’ reveals unambiguously the kind of
Being  which  belongs  to  everyday  Being-towards-death.  In  such  a  way  of
talking,  death  is  understood  as  an  indefinite  something  which,  above  all,
must duly arrive from somewhere or other, but which is proximally not yet
present-at-hand for oneself and is therefore no threat. The expression ‘one
dies’  spreads  abroad  the  opinion  that  what  gets  reached,  as  it  were,  by
death,  is  the  “they”.  In  Dasein’s  public  way  of  interpreting,  it  is  said  that
‘one dies’, because everyone else and oneself can talk himself into saying
that “in no case is it I myself”, for this “one” is the “nobody”.(2) ‘Dying’ is
levelled off to an occurrence which reaches Dasein, to be sure, but belongs
to nobody in particular. If idle talk is always ambiguous, so is this manner
of talking about death. Dying, which is essentially mine in such a way that
no  one  can  be  my  representative,  is  perverted  into  an  event  of  public
occurrence  which  the  “they”  encounters.  In  the  way  of  talking  which  we
have  characterized,  death  is  spoken  of  as  a  ‘case’  which  is  constantly
occurring. Death gets passed off as always something ‘actual’; its character
as a possibility gets concealed, and so are the other two items that belong to
it—the fact that it is non-relational and that it is not to be outstripped. By
such  ambiguity,  Dasein  puts  itself  in  the  position  of  losing  itself  in  the
“they”  as  regards  a  distinctive  potentiality-for-Being  which  belongs  to
Dasein’s  ownmost  Self.  The  “they”  gives  its  approval,  and  aggravates  the
temptation  to  cover  up  from  oneself  one’s  ownmost  Being-towards-death.
(xi) This evasive concealment in the face of death dominates everydayness
so  stubbornly  that,  in  Being  with  one  another,  the  ‘neighbours’  often  still
keep talking the ‘dying person’ into the belief that he will escape death and
soon  return  to  the  tranquillized  everydayness  of  the  world  of  his  concern.
Such ‘solicitude’ is meant to ‘console’ him.
 

x. Cf. Section 16, H. 72 ff.
xi. Cf. Section 38, H. 177 ff.

 

1. ‘…man stirbt am Ende auch einmal, aber zunächst bleibt man selbst unbetroffen.’
2. ‘Die öffentliche Daseinsauslegung sagt: “man stirbt”, weil damit jeder andere und man selbst
sich einreden kann: je nicht gerade ich; denn dieses Man ist das Niemand.’ While  we  have  usually
followed the convention of translating the indefinite pronoun ‘man’ as ‘one’ and the expression ‘das
Man’ as ‘the “they” ’,to do so here would obscure the point.

It insists upon bringing him back into Dasein, while in addition it helps
him  to  keep  his  ownmost  non-relational  possibility-of-Being  completely
concealed.  In  this  manner  the  “they”  provides  [besorgt]  a  constant
tranquillization  about  death.  At bottom,  however,  this is  a tranquillization
not  only  for  him who is  ‘dying’ but  just as much  for  those  who ‘console’
him. And even in the case of a demise, the public is still not to have its own
tranquillity upset by such an event, or be disturbed in the carefreeness with
which it concerns itself.(1) Indeed the dying of Others is seen often enough
as  a  social  inconvenience,  if  not  even  a  downright  tactlessness,  against
which the public is to be guarded.(xii)
 

xii.  In  his  story  ‘The  Death  of  Ivan  Ilyitch’  Leo  Tolstoi  has  presented  the  phenomenon  of  the

disruption and breakdown of having ‘someone die’.
 

1. ‘Und selbst im Falle des Ablebens noch soll die Öffentlichkeit durch das Ereignis nicht in ihrer

besorgten Sorglosigkeit gestört und beunruhigt werden.’

But  along  with  this  tranquilization,  which  forces  Dasein  away  from  its
death,  the  “they”  at  the  same  time  puts  itself  in  the  right  and  makes  itself
respectable  by  tacitly  regulating  the  way  in  which  one  has  to  comport
oneself  towards  death.  It  is  already  a  matter  of  public  acceptance  that
‘thinking about death’ is a cowardly fear, a sign of insecurity on the part of
Dasein, and a sombre way of fleeing from the world. The “they” does not
permit us the courage for anxiety in the face of death. The dominance of the
manner  in  which  things  have  been  publicly  interpreted  by  the  “they”,  has
already  decided  what  state-of-mind  is  to  determine  our  attitude  towards
death.  In  anxiety  in  the  face  of  death,  Dasein  is  brought  face  to  face  with
itself as delivered over to that possibility which is not to be outstripped. The
“they” concerns itself with transforming this anxiety into fear in the face of
an  oncoming  event.  In  addition,  the  anxiety  which  has  been  made
ambiguous as fear, is passed off as a weakness with which no self-assured
Dasein may have any acquaintance. What is ‘fitting’ [Was sich... “gehört”]
according to the unuttered decree of the “they”, is indifferent tranquillity as
to the ‘fact’ that one dies. The cultivation of such a ‘superior’ indifference
alienates Dasein from its ownmost non-relational potentiality-for-Being.

H. 255

 

But  temptation,  tranquilization,  and  alienation  are  distinguishing  marks
of the kind of Being called “falling”. As  falling, everyday  Being-towards-
death is a constant fleeing in the face of death.  Being-towards-the-end has
the  mode  of  evasion  in  the  face  of  it—giving  new  explanations  for  it,
understanding  it  inauthentically,  and  concealing  it.  Factically  one’s  own
Dasein is always dying already; that is to say, it is in a Being-towards-its-
end. And it hides this Fact from itself by recoining “death” as just a “case of
death” in  Others—an  everyday  occurrence which, if  need be, gives  us the
assurance still more plainly that ‘oneself’ is still ‘living’. But in thus falling
and fleeing in the face of death, Dasein’s everydayness attests that the very
“they” itself already has the definite character of Being-towards-death, even
when it is not explicitly engaged in ‘thinking about death’. Even in average
everydayness,  this  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being,  which  is  non-relational
and not to be outstripped, is constantly an issue for Dasein. This is the case
when  its  concern  is  merely  in  the  mode  of  an  untroubled  indifference
towards the uttermost possibility of existence.(1)

In  setting  forth  everyday  Being-towards-death,  however,  we  are  at  the
same time enjoined to try to secure a full existential conception of Being-
towards-the-end,  by  a  more  penetrating  Interpretation  in  which  falling
Being-towards-death is taken as an evasion in the face of death. That in the
face  of  which  one  flees  has  been  made  visible  in  a  way  which  is
phenomenally  adequate.  Against  this  it  must  be  possible  to  project
phenomenologically the way in which evasive Dasein itself understands its
death.(xiii)

52.  Everyday  Being-towards-the-end,  and 

the  Full  Existential

Conception of Death
 

In  our  preliminary  existential  sketch,  Being-towards-the-end  has  been
defined  as  Being  towards  one’s  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being,  which  is
non-relational and is not to be outstripped. Being towards this possibility, as

a Being which exists, is brought face to face with the absolute impossibility
of  existence.  Beyond  this  seemingly  empty  characterization  of  Being-
towards-death,  there  has  been  revealed  the  concretion  of  this  Being  in  the
mode of everydayness. In accordance with the tendency to falling, which is
essential  to  everydayness,  Being-towards-death  has  turned  out  to  be  an
evasion  in  the  face  of  death—an  evasion  which  conceals.  While  our
investigation  has  hitherto  passed  from  a  formal  sketch  of  the  ontological
structure of death  to  the  concrete analysis of everyday  Being-towards-the-
end,  the  direction  is  now  to  be  reversed,  and  we  shall  arrive  at  the  full
existential  conception  of  death  by  rounding  out  our  Interpretation  of
everyday Being-towards-the-end.

In  explicating  everyday  Being-towards-death  we  have  clung  to  the  idle
talk  of  the  “they”  to  the  effect  that  “one  dies  too,  sometime,  but  not  right
away.”(2) All that we have Interpreted thus far is the ‘one dies’ as such. In
the ‘sometime, but not right away’, everydayness concedes something like a
certainty of death. Nobody doubts that one dies. On the other hand, this ‘not
doubting’  need not  imply  that kind  of Being-certain  which corresponds to
the  way  death—in  the  sense  of  the  distinctive  possibility  characterized
above—enters  into  Dasein.  Everydayness  confines  itself  to  conceding  the
‘certainty’ of death in this ambiguous manner just in order to weaken that
certainty  by  covering  up  dying  still  more  and  to  alleviate  its  own
thrownness into death.
 

1.  ‘…wenn  auch  nur  im  Modus  des  Besorgens  einer  unbehelligten  Gleichgültigkeit  gegen  die
äusserste  Möglichkeit  seiner  Existenz.’  Ordinarily  the  expression  ‘Gleichgültigkeit  gegen’  means
simply ‘indifference towards’. But Heidegger’s use of boldface type suggests that here he also has in
mind that ‘gegen’ may mean ‘against’ or ‘in opposition to’.
2. ‘…man stirbt auch einmal, aber vorläufig noch nicht.’

H. 256

 

By  its very meaning,  this evasive concealment  in  the  face  of death can
not be authentically  ‘certain’ of death, and yet  it is  certain of it. What are
we to say about the ‘certainty of death’?

To be certain of an entity means to hold it for true as something true.(1)
But  “truth”  signifies 
the  uncoveredness  of  some  entity,  and  all
uncoveredness  is  grounded  ontologically  in  the  most  primordial  truth,  the
disclosedness  of  Dasein.(xiv)  As  an  entity  which  is  both  disclosed  and

disclosing, and one which uncovers, Dasein is essentially ‘in the truth’. But
certainly  is  grounded  in  the  truth,  or  belongs  to  it  equiprimordially.  The
expression  ‘certainty’,  like  the  term  ‘truth’,  has  a  double  signification.
Primordially  “truth”  means  the  same  as  “Being-disclosive”,  as  a  way  in
which  Dasein  behaves.  From  this  comes  the  derivative  signification:  “the
uncoveredness  of  entities”.  Correspondingly,  “certainty”,  in  its  primordial
signification,  is  tantamount  to  “Being-certain”,  as  a  kind  of  Being  which
belongs  to  Dasein.  However,  in  a  derivative  signification,  any  entity  of
which Dasein can be certain will also get called something ‘certain’.

One  mode  of  certainty  is  conviction.  In  conviction,  Dasein  lets  the
testimony of the thing itself which has been uncovered (the true thing itself)
be the sole determinant for its Being towards that thing understandingly.(2)
Holding something for true is adequate as a way of maintaining oneself in
the  truth,  if  it  is  grounded  in  the  uncovered  entity  itself  and  if,  as  Being
towards  the  entity  so  uncovered,  it  has  become  transparent  to  itself  as
regards  its  appropriateness  to  that  entity.  In  any  arbitrary  fiction  or  in
merely having some ‘view’ [“Ansicht”] about an entity, this sort of thing is
lacking.
 

xiv. Cf. Section 44, H. 212 ff., especially H. 219 ff.

 

1. ‘Eines Seienden gewiss-sein besagt: es als wahres für wahr halten.’ The earlier editions have
‘Gewisssein’ instead of ‘gewiss-sein’. Our literal but rather unidiomatic translation of the phrase ‘für
wahr  halten’  seems  desirable  in  view  of  Heidegger’s  extensive  use  of  the  verb  ‘halten’  (‘hold’)  in
subsequent passages where this phrase occurs, though this is obscured by our translating ‘halten sich
in...’ as ‘maintain itself in...’ and ‘halten sich an...’ as ‘cling to...’ or ‘stick to…’.

2. ‘In ihr lässt sich das Dasein einzig durch das Zeugnis der entdeckten (wahre) Sache selbst sein
verstehendes Sein zu dieser bestimmen.’ The connection between ‘Überzeugung’ (‘conviction’) and
‘Zeugnis’ (testimony) is obscured in our translation.

The  adequacy  of  holding-for-true  is  measured  according  to  the  truth-
claim to which it belongs. Such a claim gets its justification from the kind
of  Being  of  the  entity  to  be  disclosed,  and  from  the  direction  of  the
disclosure. The kind of truth, and along with it, the certainty, varies with the
way entities differ, and accords with the guiding tendency and extent of the
disclosure.  Our  present  considerations  will  be  restricted  to  an  analysis  of
Being-certain  with  regard  to  death;  and  this  Being-certain  will  in  the  end
present us with a distinctive certainty of Dasein.

H. 257

For the most part, everyday Dasein covers up the ownmost possibility of
its Being—that possibility which is non-relational and not to be outstripped.
This  factical  tendency  to  cover  up  confirms  our  thesis  that  Dasein,  as
factical,  is  in  the  ‘untruth’.(xv)  Therefore  the  certainty  which  belongs  to
such a covering-up of Being-towards-death must be an inappropriate way of
holding-for-true,  and  not,  for  instance,  an  uncertainty  in  the  sense  of  a
doubting.  In  inappropriate  certainty,  that  of  which  one  is  certain  is  held
covered up. If ‘one’ understands death as an event which one encounters in
one’s environment, then the certainty which is related to such events does
not pertain to Being-towards-the-end.

They say, “It  is  certain that ‘Death’  is  coming.’(1) They say  it,  and  the
“they”  overlooks  the  fact  that  in  order  to  be  able  to  be  certain  of  death,
Dasein  itself  must  in  every  case  be  certain  of  its  own-most  non-relational
potentiality-for-Being. They say, “Death is certain”; and in saying so, they
implant in Dasein the illusion that it is itself certain of its death. And what is
the  ground  of  everyday  Being-certain?  Manifestly,  it  is  not  just  mutual
persuasion.  Yet  the  ‘dying’  of  Others  is  something  that  one  experiences
daily. Death is an undeniable ‘fact of experience’.
 

xv. Cf. Section 44 b H. 222.

1. ‘Man sagt: es ist gewiss, dass “der” Tod kommt.’

The  way  in  which  everyday  Being-towards-death  understands  the
certainty which is thus grounded, betrays itself when it tries to ‘think’ about
death,  even  when  it  does  so  with  critical  foresight—that  is  to  say,  in  an
appropriate manner. So far as one knows, all men ‘die’. Death is probable in
the  highest  degree  for  every  man,  yet  it  is  not  ‘unconditionally’  certain.
Taken  strictly,  a  certainty  which  is  ‘only’  empirical  may  be  attributed  to
death.  Such  certainty  necessarily  falls  short  of  the  highest  certainty,  the
apodictic, which we reach in certain domains of theoretical knowledge.

H. 258

 

 

 

In  this  ‘critical’  determination  of  the  certainty  of  death,  and  of  its
impendence, what is manifested in the first instance is, once again, a failure
to  recognize  Dasein’s  kind  of  Being  and  the  Being-towards-death  which
belongs to Dasein—a failure that is characteristic of everydayness. The fact
that demise, as an event which occurs, is ‘only’ empirically certain, is in no
way decisive as to the certainty of death. Cases of death may be the factical
occasion  for  Dasein’s  first  paying  attention  to  death  at  all.  So  long,
however,  as  Dasein  remains  in  the  empirical  certainty  which  we  have
mentioned, death, in the way that it ‘is’, is something of which Dasein can
by no means become certain. Even though, in the publicness of the “they”,
Dasein  seems  to  ‘talk’  only  of  this  ‘empirical’  certainty  of  death,
nevertheless  at  bottom  Dasein  does  not  exclusively  or  primarily  stick  to
those  cases  of  death  which  merely  occur.  In  evading  its  death,  even
everyday  Being-towards-the-end  is  indeed  certain  of  its  death  in  another
way  than  it  might  itself  like  to  have  true  on  purely  theoretical
considerations.  This  ‘other  way’  is  what  everydayness  for  the  most  part
veils  from  itself:  Everydayness  does  not  dare  to  let  itself  become
transparent in such a manner. We have already characterized the every-day
state-of-mind  which  consists  in  an  air  of  superiority  with  regard  to  the
certain ‘fact’ of death—a superiority which is ‘anxiously’ concerned while
this  state-of-mind,  everydayness
In 
seemingly 
acknowledges  a  ‘higher’  certainty  than  one  which  is  only  empirical.  One
knows about the certainty of death, and yet ‘is’ not authentically certain of
one’s  own.  The  falling  everydayness  of  Dasein  is  acquainted  with  death’s
certainty, and yet  evades Being-certain.  But  in  the  light  of  what  it  evades,
this  very  evasion  attests  phenomenally  that  death  must  be  conceived  as
one’s  ownmost  possibility,  non-relational,  not  to  be  outstripped,  and—
above all—certain.

from  anxiety. 

free 

One says, “Death certainly comes, but not right away”. With this ‘but...’,
the  “they”  denies  that  death  is  certain.  ‘Not  right  away’  is  not  a  purely
negative assertion, but a way in which the “they” interprets itself. With this
interpretation, the “they” refers itself to that which is proximally accessible
to Dasein and amenable to its concern. Everydayness forces its way into the
urgency  of  concern,  and  divests  itself  of  the  fetters  of  a  weary  ‘inactive
thinking  about  death’.  Death  is  deferred  to  ‘sometime  later’,  and  this  is
done by invoking the so-called ‘general opinion’ [“allgemeine Ermessen”].
Thus  the  “they”  covers  up  what  is  peculiar  in  death’s  certainty—that it  is

possible  at  any  moment.  Along  with  the  certainty  of  death  goes  the
indefiniteness  of  its  “when”.  Everyday  Being-towards-death  evades  this
indefiniteness  by  conferring  definiteness  upon  it.  But  such  a  procedure
cannot signify calculating when the demise is due to arrive. In the face of
definiteness  such  as  this,  Dasein  would  sooner  flee.  Everyday  concern
makes  definite  for  itself  the  indefiniteness  of  certain  death  by  interposing
before it those urgencies and possibilities which can be taken in at a glance,
and which belong to the everyday matters that are closest to us.

But when this indefiniteness has been covered up, the certainty has been
covered up too. Thus death’s ownmost character as a possibility gets veiled
—a possibility which is certain and at the same time indefinite—that is to
say, possible at any moment.

Now that we have completed our Interpretation of the everyday manner
in which the “they” talks about death and the way death enters into Dasein,
we have been led to the characters of certainty and indefiniteness. The full
existential-ontological conception of death may now be defined as follows:
death,  as  the  end  of  Dasein,  is  Dasein’s  ownmost  possibility—non-
relational, certain and as such indefinite, not to be outstripped. Death is, as
Dasein’s end, in the Being of this entity towards its end.

H. 259

 

this 

that 

end, 

conclusive 

Defining  the  existential  structure  of  Being-towards-the-end  helps  us  to
work out a kind of Being of Dasein in which Dasein, as Dasein,  can be a
whole. The fact that even everyday Dasein already is towards its end—that
is to say, is constantly coming to grips with its death, though in a ‘fugitive’
and
manner—shows 
determinative  for  Being-a-whole,  is  not  something  to  which  Dasein
ultimately comes only in its demise. In Dasein, as being towards its death,
its  own  uttermost  “not-yet”  has  already  been  included—that  “not-yet”
which  all  others  lie  ahead  of.(1)  So  if  one  has  given  an  ontologically
inappropriate  Interpretation  of  Dasein’s  “not-yet”  as  something  still
outstanding, any formal inference from this to Dasein’s lack of totality will
not be correct. The phenomenon of the “not-yet” has been taken over from
the  “ahead-of-itself”;  no  more  than  the  care-structure  in  general,  can  it
serve  as  a  higher  court  which  would  rule  against  the  possibility  of  an
existent  Being-a-whole;  indeed  this  “ahead-of-itself”  is  what  first  of  all

[abschliessende] 

makes such a Being-towards-the-end possible. The problem of the possible
Being-a-whole of that entity which each of us is, is a correct one if care, as
Dasein’s basic state, is ‘connected’ with death—the uttermost possibility for
that entity.
 

1. ‘…dem alle anderen vorgelagert sind...’ This clause is ambiguous, both in the German and in
our translation, though the point is fairly clear. The ultimate ‘not-yet’ is not one which all others ‘lie
ahead of’ in the sense that they lie beyond it or come after it; for nothing can ‘lie ahead of it’ in this
sense.  But  they  can ‘lie  ahead  of  it’  in  the  sense  that  they  might  be  actualized  before  the  ultimate
‘not-yet’  has  been  actualized.  (Contrast  this  passage  with  H.  302,  where  the  same  participle
‘vorgelagert’ is apparently applied in the former sense to death itself.)

Meanwhile, it remains questionable whether this problem has been as yet
adequately worked out. Being-towards-death is grounded in care. Dasein, as
thrown Being-in-the-world, has in every case already been delivered over to
its death. In being towards its death, Dasein is dying factically and indeed
constantly, as long as it has not yet come to its demise. When we say that
Dasein is factically dying, we are saying at the same time that in its Being-
towards-death Dasein has always decided itself in one way or another. Our
everyday  falling  evasion  in  the  face  of  death  is  an  inauthentic  Being-
towards-death. But inauthenticity is based on the possibility of authenticity.
(xvi)  Inauthenticity  characterizes  a  kind  of  Being  into  which  Dasein  can
divert itself and has for the most part always diverted itself; but Dasein does
not necessarily and constantly have to divert itself into this kind of Being.
Because Dasein exists, it determines its own character as the kind of entity
it is, and it does so in every case in terms of a possibility which it itself is
and which it understands.(1)
 

xvi. The inauthenticity of Dasein has been handled in Section 9 (H. 42 ff.), Section 27 (H. 130),

1. ‘Weil das Dasein existiert, bestimmt es sich als Seiendes, wie es ist, je aus einer Möglichkeit,

and especially Section 38 (H. 175 ff.).
 

die es selbst ist und versteht.’

H. 260

 

Can Dasein also understand authentically its ownmost possibility, which
is  non-relational  and  not  to  be  outstripped,  which  is  certain  and,  as  such,
indefinite?  That  is,  can  Dasein  maintain  itself  in  an  authentic  Being-

towards-its-end?  As  long  as  this  authentic  Being-towards-death  has  not
been  set  forth  and  ontologically  defined,  there  is  something  essentially
lacking in our existential Interpretation of Being-towards-the-end.

Authentic  Being-towards-death  signifies  an  existentiell  possibility  of
Dasein.  This  ontical  potentiality-for-Being  must,  in  turn,  be  ontologically
possible.  What  are  the  existential  conditions  of  this  possibility?  How  are
they themselves to become accessible?

53. Existential Projection of an Authentic Being-towards-death

 

Factically, Dasein maintains itself proximally and for the most part in an
inauthentic  Being-towards-death.  How  is  the  ontological  possibility  of  an
authentic Being-towards-death  to  be  characterized  ‘Objectively’,  if,  in  the
end,  Dasein  never  comports  itself  authentically  towards  its  end,  or  if,  in
accordance with its very meaning, this authentic Being must remain hidden
from the  Others?  Is it not  a fanciful  undertaking,  to  project  the  existential
possibility of so questionable an existentiell potentiality-for-Being? What is
needed,  if  such  a  projection  is  to  go  beyond  a  merely  fictitious  arbitrary
construction? Does Dasein itself give us any instructions for carrying it out?
And can any grounds for its phenomenal legitimacy be taken from Dasein
itself? Can our analysis of Dasein up to this point give us any prescriptions
for  the  ontological  task  we  have  now  set  ourselves,  so  that  what  we  have
before us may be kept on a road of which we can be sure?

The existential conception of death has been established; and therewith
we have also established what it is that an authentic Being-towards-the-end
should  be  able  to  comport  itself  towards.  We  have  also  characterized
inauthentic Being-towards-death, and thus we have prescribed in a negative
way [prohibitiv] how it is possible for authentic Being-towards-death not to
be. It is with these positive and prohibitive instructions that the existential
edifice of an authentic Being-towards-death must let itself be projected.

Dasein is constituted by disclosedness—that is, by an understanding with
a state-of-mind. Authentic Being-towards-death can not evade its own-most
non-relational possibility, or cover  up  this possibility by thus  fleeing  from
it, or give a new explanation for it to accord with the common sense of the
“they”.  In  our  existential  projection  of  an  authentic  Being-towards-death,
therefore,  we  must  set  forth  those  items  in  such  a  Being  which  are

constitutive  for  it  as  an  understanding  of  death—and  as  such  an
understanding in the sense of Being towards this possibility without either
fleeing it or covering it up.

H. 261

 

In  the  first  instance,  we  must  characterize  Being-towards-death  as  a
Being  towards  a  possibility—indeed,  towards  a  distinctive  possibility  of
Dasein  itself.  “Being  towards”  a  possibility—that  is  to  say,  towards
something possible—may signify “Being out for” something possible, as in
concerning ourselves with its actualization. Such possibilities are constantly
encountered  in  the  field  of  what  is  ready-to-hand  and  present-at-hand—
what  is  attainable,  controllable,  practicable,  and  the  like.  In  concernfully
Being  out  for  something  possible,  there  is  a  tendency  to  annihilate  the
possibility of the possible by making it available to us. But the concernful
actualization  of  equipment  which  is  ready-to-hand  (as  in  producing  it,
getting  it  ready,  readjusting  it,  and  so  on)  is  always  merely  relative,  since
even that which has been actualized is still characterized in terms of some
involvements—indeed  this  is  precisely  what  characterizes  its  Being.  Even
though  actualized,  it  remains,  as  actual,  something  possible  for  doing
something;  it  is  characterized  by  an  “in-order-to”.  What  our  analysis  is  to
make plain is simply how Being out for something concernfully, comports
itself  towards  the  possible:  it  does  so  not  by  the  theoretico-thematical
consideration  of  the  possible  as  possible,  and  by  having  regard  for  its
possibility  as  such,  but  rather  by  looking  circumspectively away  from  the
possible and looking at that for which it is possible [das Wofür-möglich].

Manifestly Being-towards-death, which is now in question, cannot have
the  character  of  concernfully  Being  out  to  get  itself  actualized.  For  one
thing, death as possible is not something possible which is ready-to-hand or
present-at-hand, but a possibility of Dasein’s Being.  So  to  concern  oneself
with  actualizing  what  is  thus  possible  would  have  to  signify,  “bringing
about one’s demise”. But if this were done, Dasein would deprive itself of
the very ground for an existing Being-towards-death.

Thus,  if  by  “Being  towards  death”  we  do  not  have  in  view  an
‘actualizing’  of  death,  neither  can  we  mean  “dwelling  upon  the  end  in  its
possibility”. This is the way one comports oneself when one ‘thinks about
death’,  pondering  over  when  and  how  this  possibility  may  perhaps  be

actualized.  Of  course  such  brooding  over  death  does  not  fully  take  away
from it its character as a possibility. Indeed, it always gets brooded over as
something that is coming; but in such brooding we weaken it by calculating
how we are to have it at our disposal. As something possible, it is to show
as little as possible of its possibility. On the other hand, if Being-towards-
death  has  to  disclose  understandingly  the  possibility  which  we  have
characterized, and if it is to disclose it as a possibility, then in such Being-
towards-death this possibility must not be weakened: it must be understood
as a possibility, it  must  be  cultivated as  a  possibility, and  we  must put  up
with it as a possibility, in the way we comport ourselves towards it.

H. 262

 

However,  Dasein  comports  itself  towards  something  possible  in  its
possibility  by  expecting  it  [im  Erwarten]  .  Anyone  who  is  intent  on
something  possible,  may  encounter  it  unimpeded  and  undiminished  in  its
‘whether  it  comes  or  does  not,  or  whether  it  comes  after  all’.(1)  But  with
this phenomenon of expecting, has not our analysis reached the same kind
of Being towards the possible to which we have already called attention in
our  description  of  “Being  out  for  something”  concernfully?  To  expect
something possible is always to understand it and to ‘have’ it with regard to
whether and when and how it will be actually present-at-hand. Expecting is
not  just  an  occasional  looking-away  from  the  possible  to  its  possible
actualization, but is essentially a waiting for that actualization [ein Warten
auf diese]. Even in expecting, one leaps away from the possible and gets a
foothold in the actual. It is for its actuality that what is expected is expected.
By  the  very  nature  of  expecting,  the  possible  is  drawn  into  the  actual,
arising out of the actual and returning to it.(2)

But  Being  towards  this  possibility,  as  Being-towards-death,  is  so  to
comport ourselves towards death that in this Being, and for it, death reveals
itself  as  a  possibility.  Our  terminology  for  such  Being  towards  this
possibility  is  “anticipation”  of  this  possibility.(3)  But  in  this  way  of
behaving does there not lurk a coming-close to the possible, and when one
is  close  to  the  possible,  does  not  its  actualization  emerge?  In  this  kind  of
coming  close,  however,  one  does  not  tend  towards  concernfully  making
available  something  actual;  but  as  one  comes  closer  understandingly,  the
possibility  of  the  possible  just  becomes  ‘greater’.  The  closest  closeness

which  one  may  have  in  Being  towards  death  as  a  possibility,  is  as  far  as
possible  from  anything  actual.  The  more  unveiledly  this  possibility  gets
understood, the more purely does the understanding penetrate into it as the
possibility of the impossibility of any existence at all. Death, as possibility,
gives  Dasein  nothing  to  be  ‘actualized’,  nothing  which  Dasein,  as  actual,
could  itself  be.  It  is  the  possibility  of  the  impossibility  of  every  way  of
comporting  oneself  towards  anything,  of  every  way  of  existing.  In  the
anticipation  of  this  possibility  it  becomes  ‘greater  and  greater’;  that  is  to
say, the possibility reveals itself to be such that it knows no measure at all,
no  more  or  less,  but  signifies  the  possibility  of  the  measureless
impossibility  of  existence.  In  accordance  with  its  essence,  this  possibility
offers no support for becoming intent on something, ‘picturing’ to oneself
the  actuality  which  is  possible,  and  so  forgetting  its  possibility.  Being-
towards-death,  as  anticipation  of  possibility,  is  what  first  makes  this
possibility possible, and sets it free as possibility.

which  occurs  rather  seldom,  we  shall  also  use  it—less  literally—to  translate  ‘vorlaufen’,  which
appears very often in the following pages, and which has the special connotation of ‘running ahead’.
But  as  Heidegger’s  remarks  have  indicated,  the  kind  of  ‘anticipation’  which  is  involved  in  Being-
towards-death, does not consist in ‘waiting for’ death or ‘dwelling upon it’ or ‘actualizing’ it before
it normally comes; nor does ‘running ahead into it’ in this sense mean that we ‘rush headlong into it’.

H. 263

 

Being-towards-death is the anticipation of a potentiality-for-being of that
entity  whose  kind  of  Being  is  anticipation  itself.(1)  In  the  anticipatory
revealing  of  this  potentiality-for-Being,  Dasein  discloses  itself  to  itself  as
regards  its  uttermost  possibility.  But  to  project  itself  on  its  ownmost
potentiality-for-Being means to be able to understand itself in the Being of
the  entity  so  revealed—namely,  to  exist.  Anticipation  turns  out  to  be  the
possibility  of  understanding  one’s  ownmost and  uttermost  potentiality-for-
Being—that is to say, the possibility of authentic existence. The ontological
constitution  of  such  existence  must  be  made  visible  by  setting  forth  the
concrete  structure  of  anticipation  of  death.  How  are  we  to  delimit  this

structure  phenomenally?  Manifestly,  we  must  do  so  by  determining  those
characteristics which must belong to an anticipatory disclosure so that it can
become  the  pure  understanding  of  that  ownmost  possibility  which  is  non-
relational  and  not  to  be  outstripped—which  is  certain  and,  as  such,
indefinite. It must be noted that understanding does not primarily mean just
gazing  at  a  meaning,  but  rather  understanding  oneself  in  that  potentiality-
for-Being which reveals itself in projection.(xvii)
 

xvii. Cf. Section 31, H. 142 ff.

 

1. ‘…dessen Seinsart das Vorlaufen selbst ist.’ The earlier editions have ‘hat’ instead of ‘ist’.

Death  is  Dasein’s  ownmost  possibility.  Being  towards  this  possibility
discloses  to  Dasein  its  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being,  in  which  its  very
Being  is  the  issue.  Here  it  can  become  manifest  to  Dasein  that  in  this
distinctive possibility of its own self, it has been wrenched away from the
“they”. This means that in anticipation any Dasein can have wrenched itself
away  from  the  “they”  already.  But  when  one  understands  that  this  is
something  which  Dasein  ‘can’  have  done,  this  only  reveals  its  factical
lostness in the everydayness of the they-self.

The ownmost possibility is non-relational. Anticipation allows Dasein to
understand that that potentiality-for-being in which its ownmost Being is an
issue, must be taken over by Dasein alone. Death does not just ‘belong’ to
one’s  own  Dasein  in  an  undifferentiated  way;  death  lays  claim  to  it  as  an
individual Dasein.  The  non-relational  character  of  death,  as  understood  in
anticipation, individualizes Dasein down to itself. This individualizing is a
way in which the ‘there’ is disclosed for existence. It makes manifest that
all  Being-alongside  the  things  with  which  we  concern  ourselves,  and  all
Being-with Others, will fail us when our ownmost potentiality-for-Being is
the issue. Dasein can be authentically itself only if it makes this possible for
itself of its own accord. But if concern and solicitude fail us, this does not
signify  at  all  that  these  ways  of  Dasein  have  been  cut  off  from  its
authentically Being-its-Self. As structures essential to Dasein’s constitution,
these  have  a  share  in  conditioning  the  possibility  of  any  existence
whatsoever.  Dasein  is  authentically  itself  only  to  the  extent  that,  as
concernful  Being-alongside  and  solicitous  Being-with,  it  projects  itself
upon its ownmost potentiality-for-Being rather than upon the possibility of

the  they-self.  The  entity  which  anticipates  its  non-relational  possibility,  is
thus forced by that very anticipation into the possibility of taking over from
itself its ownmost Being, and doing so of its own accord.

H. 264

 

The ownmost,  non-relational possibility is not  to  be  outstripped.  Being
towards  this  possibility  enables  Dasein  to  understand  that  giving  itself  up
impends  for  it  as  the  uttermost  possibility  of  its  existence.  Anticipation,
however,  unlike  inauthentic  Being-towards-death,  does  not  evade  the  fact
that  death  is  not  to  be  outstripped;  instead,  anticipation  frees  itself  for
accepting  this.  When,  by  anticipation,  one  becomes  free  for  one’s  own
death, one is liberated from one’s lostness in those possibilities which may
accidentally thrust themselves upon one; and one is liberated in such a way
that  for  the  first  time  one  can  authentically  understand  and  choose  among
the  factical  possibilities  lying  ahead  of  that  possibility  which  is  not  to  be
outstripped.(1)  Anticipation  discloses  to  existence  that  its  uttermost
possibility lies in giving itself up, and thus it shatters all one’s tenaciousness
to whatever existence one has reached. In anticipation, Dasein guards itself
against falling back behind itself, or behind the potentiality-for-Being which
it has understood. It guards itself against ‘becoming too old for its victories’
(Nietzsche). Free for its ownmost possibilities, which are determined by the
end  and  so  are  understood  as  finite  [endliche],  Dasein  dispels  the  danger
that  it  may,  by  its  own  finite  understanding  of  existence,  fail  to  recognize
that  it  is  getting  outstripped  by  the  existence-possibilities  of  Others,  or
rather  that  it  may  explain  these  possibilities  wrongly  and  force  them  back
upon its own, so that it may divest itself of its ownmost factical existence.
As  the  non-relational  possibility,  death  individualizes—but  only  in  such  a
manner  that,  as  the  possibility  which  is  not  to  be  outstripped,  it  makes
Dasein,  as  Being-with,  have  some  understanding  of  the  potentiality-for-
Being  of  Others.  Since  anticipation  of  the  possibility  which  is  not  to  be
outstripped  discloses  also  all  the  possibilities  which  lie  ahead  of  that
possibility, this anticipation  includes  the  possibility of taking the whole of
Dasein  in  advance  [Vorwegnehmens]  in  an  existentiell  manner;  that  is  to
say, it includes the possibility of existing as a whole potentiality-for-Being.
 

1. ‘…die der unüberholbaren vorgelagert sind.’ See note 1, H. 259 above.

The ownmost, non-relational possibility, which is not to be outstripped,
is certain. The  way  to  be  certain  of  it  is  determined  by  the  kind  of  truth
which  corresponds  to  it  (disclosedness).  The  certain  possibility  of  death,
however, discloses Dasein as a possibility, but does so only in such a way
that,  in  anticipating  this  possibility,  Dasein  makes  this  possibility  possible
for  itself  as  its  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being.(1)  The  possibility  is
disclosed because it is made possible in anticipation. To maintain oneself in
this  truth—that  is,  to  be  certain  of  what  has  been  disclosed—demands  all
the  more  that  one  should  anticipate.  We  cannot  compute  the  certainty  of
death by ascertaining how many cases of death we encounter. This certainty
is by no means of the kind which maintains itself in the truth of the present-
at-hand.  When  something  present-at-hand  has  been  uncovered,  it  is
encountered  most  purely  if  we  just  look  at  the  entity  and  let  it  be
encountered  in  itself.  Dasein  must  first  have  lost  itself  in  the  factual
circumstances  [Sachverhalte]  (this  can  be  one  of  care’s  own  tasks  and
possibilities)  if  it  is  to  obtain  the  pure  objectivity—that  is  to  say,  the
indifference—of  apodictic  evidence.  If  Being-certain  in  relation  to  death
does not have this character, this does not mean that it is of a lower grade,
but that it does not belong at all to the graded order of the kinds of evidence
we can have about the present-at-hand.
 

1. ‘Die gewisse Möglichkeit des Todes erschliesst das Dasein aber als Möglichkeit nur so, dass es
vorlaufend  zu  ihr  diese  Möglichkeit  als  eigenstes  Seinkönnen  für  sich  ermöglicht.’ While  we  have
taken ‘Die gewisse Möglichkeit des Todes’ as the subject of this puzzling sentence, ‘das Dasein’ may
be  the  subject  instead.  The  use  of  the  preposition  ‘zu’  instead  of  the  usual  ‘in’  after  ‘vorlaufend’
suggests that in ‘anticipating’ the possibility of death, Dasein is here thought of as ‘running ahead’
towards it  or up to it  rather  than  into  it.  When  this  construction  occurs  in  later  passages,  we  shall
indicate it by subjoining ‘zu’ in brackets.

H. 265

 

Holding  death for  true (death is  just  one’s  own)  shows  another  kind  of
certainty, and is more primordial than any certainty which relates to entities
encountered  within-the-world,  or  to  formal  objects;  for  it  is  certain  of
Being-in-the-world.  As  such,  holding  death  for  true  does  not  demand  just
one definite kind of behaviour in Dasein, but demands Dasein itself in the
full authenticity of its existence.(xviii) In anticipation Dasein can first make
certain  of  its  ownmost  Being  in  its  totality—a  totality  which  is  not  to  be
outstripped.  Therefore  the  evidential  character  which  belongs  to  the

immediate givenness of Experiences, of the “I”, or of consciousness, must
necessarily lag behind the certainty which anticipation includes. Yet this is
not  because  the  way  in  which  these  are  grasped  would  not  be  a  rigorous
one, but because in principle such a way of grasping them cannot hold for
true (disclosed) something which at bottom it insists upon ‘having there’ as
true: namely, Dasein itself which I myself am, and which, as a potentiality-
for-Being, I can be authentically only by anticipation.
 

xviii. Cf. Section 62, H. 305 ff.

H. 266

 

The ownmost possibility, which is non-relational, not to be outstripped,
and  certain,  is  indefinite  as  regards  its  certainty.  How  does  anticipation
disclose this characteristic of Dasein’s distinctive possibility? How does the
anticipatory  understanding  project  itself  upon  a  potentiality-for-Being
which  is  certain  and  which  is  constantly  possible  in  such  a  way  that  the
“when”  in  which  the  utter  impossibility  of  existence  becomes  possible
remains constantly indefinite? In anticipating [zum] the indefinite certainty
of  death,  Dasein  opens  itself  to  a  constant  threat  arising  out  of  its  own
“there”. In this very threat Being-towards-the-end must maintain itself. So
little can it tone this down that it must rather cultivate the indefiniteness of
the  certainty.  How  is  it  existentially  possible  for  this  constant  threat  to  be
genuinely disclosed? All understanding is accompanied by a state-of-mind.
Dasein’s  mood  brings  it  face  to  face  with  the  thrownness  of  its  ‘that  it  is
there’.(xix)  But  the  state-of-mind  which  can  hold  open  the  utter  and
constant  threat  to  itself  arising  from  Dasein’s  ownmost  individualized
Being,  is  anxiety.(xx)(1)  In  this  state-of-mind,  Dasein  finds  itself  face  to
face  with  the  “nothing”  of  the  possible  impossibility  of  its  existence.
Anxiety is anxious about the potentiality-for-Being of the entity so destined
[des  so  bestimmten  Seienden],  and  in  this  way  it  discloses  the  uttermost
possibility. Anticipation utterly individualizes Dasein, and allows it, in this
individualization  of  itself,  to  become  certain  of  the  totality  of  its
potentiality-for-Being.  For  this  reason,  anxiety  as  a  basic  state-of-mind
belongs to such a self-understanding of Dasein on the basis of Dasein itself.

1.  ‘Die  Befindlichkeit  aber,  welche  die  ständige  und  schlechthinnige,  aus  dem  eigensten
vereinzelten Sein des Dasiens aufsteigende Bedrohung seiner selbst offen zu halten vermag, ist die
Angst.’  Notice  that  ‘welche’  may  be  construed  either  as  the  subject  or  as  the  direct  object  of  the
relative clause.

2.  ‘…gehört  zu  diesem  Sichverstehen  des  Daseins  aus  seinem  Grunde  die  Grundbefindlichkeit

der Angst.’ It is not grammatically clear whether ‘seinem’ refers to ‘Sichverstehen’ or to ‘Daseins’.

We  may  now  summarize  our  characterization  of  authentic  Being-
towards-death as we have projected it existentially: anticipation reveals to
Dasein  its  lostness  in  the  they-self,  and  brings  it  face  to  face  with  the
possibility  of  being  itself,  primarily  unsupported  by  concernful  solicitude,
but  of  being  itself,  rather,  in  an  impassioned  freedom  towards  death—a
freedom  which  has  been  released  from  the  Illusions  of  the  “they”,  and
which is factical, certain of itself, and anxious.

All the relationships which belong to Being-towards-death, up to the full
content  of  Dasein’s  uttermost  possibility,  as  we  have  characterized  it,
constitute an anticipation which they combine in revealing, unfolding, and
holding  fast,  as  that  which  makes  this  possibility  possible.  The  existential
projection  in  which  anticipation  has  been  delimited,  has  made  visible  the
ontological  possibility  of  an  existentiell  Being-towards-death  which  is
authentic.  Therewith,  however,  the  possibility  of  Dasein’s  having  an
authentic  potentiality-for-Being-a-whole  emerges,  but  only  as  an
ontological possibility. In our existential projection of anticipation, we have
of  course  clung  to  those  structures  of  Dasein  which  we  have  arrived  at
earlier,  and  we  have,  as  it  were,  let  Dasein  itself  project  itself  upon  this
possibility,  without  holding  up  to  Dasein  an  ideal  of  existence  with  any
special  ‘content’,  or  forcing  any  such  ideal  upon  it  ‘from  outside’.
Nevertheless,  this  existentially  ‘possible’  Being-towards-death  remains,
from  the  existentiell  point  of  view,  a  fantastical  exaction.  The  fact  that  an
is  ontologically  possible  for
authentic  potentiality-for-Being-a-whole 
Dasein,  signifies  nothing,  so  long  as  a  corresponding  ontical  potentiality-
for-Being  has  not  been  demonstrated  in  Dasein  itself.  Does  Dasein  ever

factically  throw  itself  into  such  a  Being-towards-death?  Does  Dasein
demand, even  by  reason  of  its  own-most  Being,  an  authentic  potentiality-
for-Being determined by anticipation?

H. 267

 

Before  answering  these  questions,  we  must  investigate  whether  to  any
extent  and  in  any  way  Dasein  gives  testimony,  from  its  ownmost
potentiality-for-Being, as to a possible authenticity of its existence, so that it
not  only  makes  known  that  in  an  existentiell  manner  such  authenticity  is
possible, but demands this of itself.

The question  of Dasein’s authentic Being-a-whole and of its existential
constitution  still  hangs  in  mid-air.  It  can  be  put  on  a  phenomenal  basis
which will stand the test only if it can cling to a possible authenticity of its
Being which is attested by Dasein itself. If we succeed in uncovering that
attestation  phenomenologically,  together  with  what  it  attests,  then  the
problem  will  arise  anew  as  to  whether  the  anticipation  of  [zum]  death,
which we have hitherto projected only in its ontological possibility, has an
essential  connection  with  that  authentic  potentiality-for-Being  which  has
been attested.

II: DASEIN’S ATTESTATION OF AN AUTHENTIC
POTENTIALITY-FOR-BEING, AND RESOLUTENESS

 

 

 

54.  The  Problem  of  How  an  Authentic  Existentiell  Possibility  is

Attested.
 

WHAT we  are  seeking is  an authentic potentiality-for-Being  of Dasein,
which will be attested in its existentiell possibility by Dasein itself. But this
very attestation must first be such that we can find it. If in this attestation,
Dasein itself, as something for  which authentic existence is  possible,  is  to
be ‘given’ to Dasein ‘to understand’,(1) this attestation will have its roots in
Dasein’s  Being.  So  in  exhibiting  it  phenomenologically,  we  include  a
demonstration that in Dasein’s state of Being it has its source.

In  this  attestation  an  authentic  potentiality-for-Being-one’s-Self  is  to  be
given  us  to  understand.  The  question  of  the  “who”  of  Dasein  has  been
answered with the expression ‘Self’.(i) Dasein’s Selfhood has been defined
formally as a way of existing, and therefore not as an entity present-at-hand.
For the most part I myself am not the “who” of Dasein; the they-self is its
“who”. Authentic Being-one’s-Self takes the definite form of an existentiell
modification  of  the  “they”;  and  this  modification  must  be  defined
existentially.(ii)  What  does  this  modification  imply,  and  what  are  the
ontological conditions for its possibility?
 

i. Cf. Section 25, H. 114 ff.
ii. Cf. Section 27, H. 126 ff., especially H. 130.

1.  ‘…wenn  sie  dem  Dasein  es  selbst  in  seiner  möglichen  eigentlichen  Existenz  “zu  verstehen

geben”...’

H. 268

With Dasein’s lostness in the “they”, that factical potentiality-for-Being
which is closest to it (the tasks, rules, and standards, the urgency and extent,

of concernful  and solicitous Being-in-the-world) has already been decided
upon.  The  “they”  has  always  kept  Dasein  from  taking  hold  of  these
possibilities  of  Being.  The  “they”  even  hides  the  manner  in  which  it  has
tacitly  relieved  Dasein  of  the  burden  of  explicitly  choosing  these
possibilities.  It  remains  indefinite  who  has  ‘really’  done  the  choosing.  So
Dasein  make  no  choices,  gets  carried  along  by  the  nobody,  and  thus
ensnares itself in inauthenticity. This process can be reversed only if Dasein
specifically  brings  itself  back  to  itself  from  its  lostness  in  the  “they”.  But
this  bringing-back  must  have  that  kind  of  Being  by  the  neglect  of  which
Dasein has lost itself in inauthenticity. When Dasein thus brings itself back
[Das  Sichzurückholen]  from  the  “they”,  the  they-self  is  modified  in  an
existentiell  manner  so  that  it  becomes  authentic  Being-one’s-Self.  This
must  be  accomplished  by  making  up  for  not  choosing  [Nachholen  einer
Wahl]. But  “making  up”  for  not  choosing  signifies  choosing  to  make  this
choice—deciding  for  a  potentiality-for-Being,  and  making  this  decision
from  one’s  own  Self.  In  choosing  to  make  this  choice,  Dasein  makes
possible, first and foremost, its authentic potentiality-for-Being.

But because Dasein is lost in the “they”, it must first find itself. In order
to find itself at all, it must be ‘shown’ to itself in its possible authenticity. In
terms  of  its  possibility, Dasein  is  already  a  potentiality-for-Being-its-Self,
but it needs to have this potentiality attested.

In  the  following  Interpretation  we  shall  claim  that  this  potentiality  is
attested  by  that  which,  in  Dasein’s  everyday  interpretation  of  itself,  is
familiar  to  us  as  the  “voice  of  conscience”  [Stimme  des  Gewissens].(iii)
That the very ‘fact’ of conscience has been disputed, that its function as a
higher  court  for  Dasein’s  existence  has  been  variously  assessed,  and  that
‘what  conscience  says’  has  been  interpreted  in  manifold  ways—all  this
might  only  mislead  us  into  dismissing  this  phenomenon  if  the  very
‘doubtfulness’ of this Fact—or of the way in which it has been interpreted
—did  not prove  that  here  a  primordial phenomenon  of  Dasein  lies  before
us. In the following analysis conscience will be taken as something which
we  have  in  advance  theoretically,  and  it  will  be  investigated  in  a  purely
existential manner, with fundamental ontology as our aim.
 

iii.  These  observations  and  those  which  follow  after  were  communicated  as  theses  on  the

occasion of a public lecture on the concept of time, which was given at Marburg in July 1924.

H. 269

 

We  shall  first  trace  conscience  back  to  its  existential  foundations  and
structures and make it visible as a phenomenon of Dasein, holding fast to
what  we  have  hitherto  arrived  at  as  that  entity’s  state  of  Being.  The
ontological analysis of conscience on which we are thus embarking, is prior
to  any  description  and  classification  of  Experiences  of  conscience,  and
likewise  lies  outside  of  any  biological  ‘explanation’  of  this  phenomenon
(which  would  mean  its  dissolution).  But  it  is  no  less  distant  from  a
theological exegesis of conscience or any employment of this phenomenon
for proofs of God or for establishing an ‘immediate’ consciousness of God.
Nevertheless,  even  when  our  investigation  of  conscience  is  thus
restricted,  we  must  neither  exaggerate  its  outcome  nor  make  perverse
claims  about  it  and  lessen  its  worth.  As  a  phenomenon  of  Dasein,
conscience  is  not  just  a  fact  which  occurs  and  is  occasionally  present-at-
hand. It ‘is’ only in Dasein’s kind of Being, and it makes itself known as a
Fact  only  with  factical  existence  and  in  it.  The  demand  that  an  ‘inductive
empirical proof’ should be given for the ‘factuality’ of conscience and for
the  legitimacy  of  its  ‘voice’,  rests  upon  an  ontological  perversion  of  the
phenomenon.  This  perversion,  however,  is  one  that  is  shared  by  every
“superior”  criticism  in  which  conscience  is  taken  as  something  just
occurring  from  time  to  time  rather  than  as  a  ‘universally  established  and
ascertainable  fact’.  Among  such  proofs  and  counterproofs,  the  Fact  of
conscience cannot present itself at all. This is no lack in it, but merely a sign
by which we can recognize it as ontologically of a different kind from what
is environmentally present-at-hand.

it  back 

Conscience  gives  us  ‘something’  to  understand;  it  discloses.  By
characterizing  this  phenomenon  formally  in  this  way,  we  find  ourselves
enjoined 
the  disclosedness  of  Dasein.  This
disclosedness,  as  a  basic  state  of  that  entity  which  we  ourselves  are,  is
constituted  by  state-of-mind,  understanding,  falling,  and  discourse.  If  we
analyse conscience more penetratingly, it is revealed as a call [Ruf]. Calling
is  a  mode  of  discourse.  The  call  of  conscience  has  the  character  of  an
appeal to Dasein by calling it to its ownmost potentiality-for-Being-its-Self;
and this is done by way of summoning it to its ownmost Being-guilty.(1)

H. 270

 

This  existential  Interpretation  is  necessarily  a  far  cry  from  everyday
ontical  common  sense,  though  it  sets  forth  the  ontological  foundations  of
what  the  ordinary  way  of  interpreting  conscience  has  always  understood
within  certain  limits  and  has  conceptualized  as  a  ‘theory’  of  conscience.
Accordingly  our  existential  Interpretation  needs  to  be  confirmed  by  a
critique of the way in which conscience is ordinarily interpreted. When this
phenomenon  has  been  exhibited,  we  can  bring  out  the  extent  to  which  it
attests  an  authentic  potentiality-for-Being  of  Dasein.  To  the  call  of
conscience there corresponds a possible hearing. Our understanding of the
appeal  unveils 
to  have  a  conscience
[Gewissenhabenwollen].  But  in  this  phenomenon  lies  that  existentiell
choosing  which  we  seek—the  choosing  to  choose  a  kind  of  Being-one’s-
Self  which, 
its  existential  structure,  we  call
“resoluteness”.(2)  Thus  we  can  see  how  the  analyses  of  this  chapter  are
divided  up:  the  existential-ontological  foundations  of  conscience  (Section
55); the character of conscience as a call (Section 56); conscience as the call
of  care  (Section  57);  understanding  the  appeal,  and  guilt  (Section  58);  the
existential Interpretation of conscience and the way conscience is ordinarily
interpreted  (Section  59); 
the  authentic
potentiality-for-Being which is attested in the conscience (Section 60).

1.  ‘Der  Gewissensruf  hat  den  Charakter  des  Anrufs  des  Daseins  auf  sein  eigenstes
Selbstseinkönnen und das in der Weise des Aufrufs zum eigensten Schuldigsein.’ Our translation of
‘Anruf’ as ‘appeal’ and of ‘Aufruf’ as ‘summoning’ conceals the etymological connection of these
expressions  with  ‘Ruf’,  which  we  here  translate  as  ‘call’—a  word  which  we  have  already  used  in
translating  expressions  such  as  ‘nennen’,  ‘heissen’,  and  a  number  of  others.  The  verb  ‘anrufen’
(‘appeal’) means literally ‘to call to’; ‘einen auf etwas anrufen’ means ‘to call to someone and call
him to  something’.  Similarly  ‘aufrufen’  (‘summon’)  means  ‘to  call  up’;  ‘einen  zu  etwas  aufrufen’
means  ‘to  call  someone  up  to  something  which  he  is  to  do’,  in  the  sense  of  challenging  him  or
‘calling’ him to a higher level of performance.

2. ‘…das gesuchte existenzielle Wählen der Wahl eines Selbstseins, das wir, seiner existentialen
Struktur  entsprechend,  die  Entschlossenheit  nennen.’  While  our  version  preserves  the  grammatical
ambiguity of the German, it seems clear from H. 298 that the antecedent of the second relative clause
is ‘Selbstsein’ (‘a kind of Being-one’s-self’), not ‘Wählen’ (‘choosing’).

differentiation, that in some way it gives us something to understand. Our

find,  without 

analysis  of  it  takes  its  departure  from  this  finding.  Conscience  discloses,
and  thus  belongs  within  the  range  of  those  existential  phenomena  which
constitute the Being of the “there” as disclosedness.(iv) We have analysed
the most universal structures of state-of-mind, understanding, discourse and
falling. If we now bring conscience into this phenomenal context, this is not
a  matter  of  applying  these  structures  schematically  to  a  special  ‘case’  of
Dasein’s  disclosure.  On  the  contrary,  our  Interpretation  of  conscience  not
only  will  carry  further  our  earlier  analysis  of  the  disclosedness  of  the
“there”, but it will also grasp it more primordially with regard to Dasein’s
authentic Being.

Through  disclosedness,  that  entity  which  we  call  “Dasein”  is  in  the
possibility  of  being  its  “there”.  With  its  world,  it  is  there  for  itself,  and
indeed—proximally  and  for  the  most  part—in  such  a  way  that  it  has
disclosed  to  itself  its  potentiality-for-Being  in  terms  of  the  ‘world’  of  its
concern. Dasein exists as a potentiality-for-Being which has, in each case,
already  abandoned  itself  to  definite  possibilities.(1)  And  it  has  abandoned
itself  to  these  possibilities  because  it  is  an  entity  which  has  been  thrown,
and  an  entity  whose  thrownness  gets  disclosed  more  or  less  plainly  and
impressively  by  its  having  a  mood.  To  any  state-of-mind  or  mood,
understanding belongs equiprimordially. In this way Dasein ‘knows’ what it
is itself capable of [woran es mit ihm selbst ist], inasmuch as it has either
projected itself upon possibilities of its own or has been so absorbed in the
“they”  that  it  has  let  such  possibilities  be  presented  to  it  by  the  way  in
which  the  “they”  has  publicly  interpreted  things.  The  presenting  of  these
possibilities,  however,  is  made  possible  existentially  through  the  fact  that
Dasein, as a Being-with which understands, can listen to Others.
 

1.  ‘Das  Seinkönnen,  als  welches  das  Dasein  existiert,  hat  sich  je  schon  bestimmten

Möglichkeiten überlassen.’

Losing itself in the publicness and the idle talk of the “they”, it fails to
hear [überhört] its own Self in listening to the they-self. If Dasein is to be
able  to  get  brought  back  from  this  lostness  of  failing  to  hear  itself,  and  if

this is to be done through itself, then it must first be able to find itself—to
find  itself  as  something  which  has  failed  to  hear  itself,  and  which  fails  to
hear  in  that  it  listens away  to  the  “they”.(1)  This  listening-away  must  get
broken off; in other words, the possibility of another kind of hearing which
will interrupt it, must be given by Dasein itself.(2) The possibility of its thus
getting  broken  off  lies  in  its  being  appealed  to  without  mediation.  Dasein
fails  to  hear  itself,  and  listens  away  to  the  “they”;  and  this  listening-away
gets broken by the call if that call, in accordance with its character as such,
arouses another kind of hearing, which, in relationship to the hearing that is
lost,(3) has a character in every way opposite. If in this lost hearing, one has
been fascinated with the ‘hubbub’ of the manifold ambiguity which idle talk
possesses  in  its  everyday  ‘newness’,  then  the  call  must  do  its  calling
without any hubbub and unambiguously, leaving no foothold for curiosity.
That  which,  by  calling  in  this  manner,  gives  us  to  understand,  is  the
conscience.
 

1. ‘…sich selbst, das sich überhört hat und überhört im Hinhören auf das Man.’ In this passage,
Heidegger has been exploiting three variations on the verb ‘hören’: ‘hören auf...’ (our ‘listen to...’),
‘überhören’  (‘fail  to  hear’),  and  ‘hinhören’  (‘listen  away’).  The  verb  ‘überhören’  has  two  quite
distinct  uses.  It  may  mean  the  ‘hearing’  which  a  teacher  does  when  he  ‘hears’  a  pupil  recite  his
lesson; but it may also mean to ‘fail to hear’, even to ‘ignore’ what one hears. This is the meaning
which Heidegger seems to have uppermost in mind; but perhaps he is also suggesting that when one
is  lost  in  the  “they”,  one  ‘hears’  one’s  own  Self  only  in  the  manner  of  a  perfunctory  teacher  who
‘hears’  a  recitation  without  ‘really  listening  to  it’.  In  ordinary  German  the  verb  ‘hinhören’  means
hardly more than to ‘listen’; but Heidegger is emphasizing the prefix ‘hin-’, which suggests that one
is listening to something other than oneself—listening away, in this case listening to the “they”. On
other verbs of hearing and listening, see Section 34 above, especially H. 163 ff.

2. ‘Dieses Hinhören muss gebrochen, das heisst es muss vom Dasein selbst die Möglichkeit eines

Hörens gegeben werden, das jenes unterbricht.’

3. ‘…zum verlorenen Hören...’ One might suspect that the ‘lost hearing’ is the hearing which one
‘loses’ by ‘failing to hear’; but Heidegger may mean rather the kind of hearing one does when one is
lost in the “they”—‘Überhören’ of one’s own Self and ‘Hinhören’ to the ‘they’.

We  take  calling  as  a  mode  of  discourse.  Discourse  articulates
intelligibility.  Characterizing  conscience  as  a  call  is  not  just  giving  a
‘picture’,  like  the  Kantian  representation  of  the  conscience  as  a  court  of
justice.  Vocal  utterance,  however,  is  not  essential  for  discourse,  and
therefore  not  for  the  call  either; this must not  be overlooked. Discourse is
already presupposed in any expressing or ‘proclaiming’ [“Ausrufen”]. If the
everyday  interpretation  knows  a  ‘voice’  of  conscience,  then  one  is  not  so
much  thinking  of  an  utterance  (for  this  is  something  which  factically  one

never  comes across);  the  ‘voice’ is  taken rather as a giving-to-understand.
In the tendency to disclosure which belongs to the call, lies the momentum
of a push—of an abrupt arousal. The call is from afar unto afar. It reaches
him who wants to be brought back.

But  by  this  characterization  of  the  conscience  we  have  only  traced  the
phenomenal horizon for analysing its existential structure. We are not  c o m
p a r i n g  this phenomenon with a call; we are  u n d e r s t a n d i n g  it as
a  kind  of  discourse—in  terms  of  the  disclosedness  that  is  constitutive  for
Dasein.  In  considering  this  we  have  from  the  beginning  avoided  the  first
route which offers itself for an Interpretation of conscience—that of tracing
it back to some psychical faculty such as understanding, will, or feeling, or
of explaining it as some sort  of mixture of these. When one is  confronted
with  such  a  phenomenon  as  conscience,  one  is  struck  by  the  ontologico-
anthropological  inadequacy  of  a  free-floating  framework  of  psychical
faculties or personal actions all duly classified.(vi)
 

v. Cf. Section H. 160 ff.
vi. Besides the Interpretations of conscience which we find in Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, and
Nietzsche, one should notice M. Kähler’s Das  Gewissen, erster geschichtlicher Teil (1878)  and  his
article in the Realenzyklopädie für Protestantische Theologie end Kirche. See too A. Ritschl’s ‘Über
das  Gewissen’  (1876),  reprinted  in  his  Gesammelte  Aufsätze,  Neue  Folge  (1896),  pp.  177  ff.  See
finally  H.  G.  Stoker’s  monograph,  Das  Gewissen,  which  has  recently  appeared  in  Schriften  zur
Philosophie  und  Soziologie,  vol.  II  (1925),  under  the  editorship  of  Max  Scheler.  This  is  a  wide-
ranging  investigation;  it  brings  to  light  a  rich  multiplicity  of  conscience-phenomena,  characterizes
critically  the  different  possible  ways  of  treating  this  phenomenon  itself,  and  lists  some  further
literature,  though  as  regards  the  history  of  the  concept  of  conscience,  this  list  is  not  complete.
Stoker’s monograph differs from the existential Interpretation we have given above in its approach
and accordingly in its results as well, regardless of many points of agreement. Stoker underestimates
from the outset the hermeneutical conditions for a ‘description’ of ‘conscience as something which
subsists  Objectively  and  actually’  (p.  3).  This  leads  to  blurring  the  boundaries  between
phenomenology and theology, with damage to both. As regards the anthropological foundation of this
investigation, in which the personalism of Scheler has been taken over, cf. Section 10 of the present
treatise,  H.  47  ff.  All  the  same,  Stoker’s  monograph  signifies  notable  progress  as  compared  with
previous  Interpretations  of  conscience,  though  more  by  its  comprehensive  treatment  of  the
conscience-phenomena  and  their  ramifications  than  by  exhibiting  the  ontological  roots  of  the
phenomenon itself.

56. The Character of Conscience as a Call

 

 

H. 272

To any discourse there belongs that which is talked about in it. Discourse
gives  information  about  something,  and  does  so  in  some  definite  regard.
From  what  is  thus  talked  about,  it  draws  whatever  it  is  saying  as  this
particular  discourse—what  is  said  in  the  talk  as  such.  In  discourse  as
communication,  this  becomes  accessible  to  the  Dasein-with  of  Others,  for
the most part by way of uttering it in language.

In the call of conscience, what is it that is talked about—in other words,
to  what  is  the  appeal  made?  Manifestly  Dasein  itself.  This  answer  is  as
incontestable  as  it  is  indefinite.  If  the  call  has  so  vague  a  target,  then  it
might at most remain an occasion for Dasein to pay attention to itself. But it
is  essential  to  Dasein  that  along  with  the  disclosedness  of  its  world  it  has
been disclosed to itself, so that it always understands itself. The call reaches
Dasein  in  this  understanding  of  itself  which  it  always  has,  and  which  is
concernful in an everyday, average manner. The call reaches the they-self of
concernful Being with Others.

H. 273

 

And to what is one called when one is thus appealed to?(1) To one’s own
Self. Not to what Dasein counts for, can do, or concerns itself with in being
with one another publicly, nor to what it has taken hold of, set about, or let
itself be carried along with. The sort of Dasein which is understood after the
manner of the world both for Others and for itself, gets passed over in this
appeal; this is something of which the call to the Self takes not the slightest
cognizance. And because only the Self of the they-self gets appealed to and
brought to hear, the “they” collapses. But the fact that the call passes  over
both  the  “they”  and  the  manner  in  which  Dasein  has  been  publicly
interpreted,  does  not  by  any  means  signify  that  the  “they”  is  not  reached
too. Precisely in passing over the “they” (keen as it is for public repute) the
call pushes it into insignificance [Bedeutungslosigkeit]. But the Self, which
the  appeal  has  robbed  of  this  lodgement  and  hiding-place,  gets  brought  to
itself by the call.
 

1. ‘Und woraufhin wird es angerufen?’

When the they-self is appealed to, it gets called to the Self.(1) But it does
not get called to that Self which can become for itself an ‘object’ on which

to pass judgment, nor to that Self which inertly dissects its ‘inner life’ with
fussy  curiosity,  nor  to  that  Self  which  one  has  in  mind  when  one  gazes
‘analytically’ at psychical conditions and what lies behind them. The appeal
to  the  Self  in  the  they-self  does  not  force  it  inwards  upon  itself,  so  that  it
can  close  itself  off  from  the  ‘external  world’.  The  call  passes  over
everything  like  this  and  disperses  it,  so  as  to  appeal  solely  to  that  Self
which, notwithstanding, is in no other way than Being-in-the-world.

But how are we to determine what is said in the talk that belongs to this
kind  of  discourse?  What  does  the  conscience  call  to  him  to  whom  it
appeals?  Taken  strictly,  nothing.  The  call  asserts  nothing,  gives  no
information about world-events, has nothing to tell. Least of all does it try
to  set  going  a  ‘soliloquy’  in  the  Self  to  which  it  has  appealed.  ‘Nothing’
gets called to [zu-gerufen] this Self, but it has been summoned [aufgerufen]
to itself—that is, to its ownmost potentiality-for-Being. The tendency of the
call is not such as to put up for ‘trial’ the Self to which the appeal is made;
but it calls Dasein forth (and ‘forward’) into its ownmost possibilities, as a
summons to its ownmost potentiality-for-Being-its-Self.(2)

H. 274

 

The call dispenses with any kind of utterance. It does not put itself into
words  at  all;  yet  it  remains  nothing  less  than  obscure  and  indefinite.
Conscience discourses solely and constantly in the mode of keeping silent.
In this way it not only loses none of its perceptibility, but forces the Dasein
which has been appealed to and summoned, into the reticence of itself. The
fact that what is  called  in  the  call  has not  been formulated  in  words,  does
not  give  this  phenomenon  the  indefiniteness  of  a  mysterious  voice,  but
merely indicates that our understanding of what is ‘called’ is not to be tied
up with an expectation of anything like a communication.

Yet what the call discloses is unequivocal, even though it may undergo a
different interpretation in the individual Dasein in accordance with its own
possibilities  of  understanding.  While  the  content  of  the  call  is  seemingly
indefinite,  the direction  it takes  is  a  sure  one  and  is  not  to  be  overlooked.
The call does not require us to search gropingly for him to whom it appeals,
nor does it require any sign by which we can recognize that he is or is not
the one who is meant. When ‘delusions’ arise in the conscience, they do so
not because the call has committed some oversight (has miscalled),(3) but

only  because  the  call  gets  heard  in  such  a  way  that  instead  of  becoming
authentically understood, it gets drawn by the they-self into a soliloquy in
which  causes  get  pleaded,  and  it  becomes  perverted  in  its  tendency  to
disclose.
 

1. ‘Auf das Selbst wird das Man-selbst angerufen.’
2.  ‘Der  Ruf  stellt,  seiner  Ruftendenz  entsprechend,  das  angerufene  Selbst  nicht  zu  einer
“Verhandlung”,  sondern  als  Aufruf  zum  eigensten  Selbstseinkönnen  ist  er  ein  Vor-(nach-
“vorne”-)Rufen des Daseins in seine eigensten Möglichkeiten.’ The verbs ‘anrufen’, ‘aufrufen’, and
‘vorrufen’ can all be used in the legal sense of a ‘summons’.
3. ‘...ein Sichversehen (Sichver-rufen) des Rufes...’

One  must  keep  in  mind  that  when  we  designate  the  conscience  as  a
“call”, this call is an appeal to the they-self in its Self; as such an appeal, it
summons the Self to its potentiality-for-Being-its-Self and thus calls Dasein
forth to its possibilities.

But  we  shall  not  obtain  an  ontologically  adequate  Interpretation  of  the
conscience until it can be made plain not only who is called by the call but
also  who  does  the  calling,  how  the  one  to  whom  the  appeal  is  made  is
related  to  the  one  who  calls,  and  how  this  ‘relationship’  must  be  taken
ontologically as a way in which these are interconnected in their Being.

57. Conscience as the Call of Care

 

 

H. 275

Conscience summons Dasein’s Self from its lostness in the “they”. The
Self to which the appeal is made remains indefinite and empty in its “what”.
When Dasein interprets itself in terms of that with which it concerns itself,
the  call  passes  over  what  Dasein,  proximally  and  for  the  most  part,
understands  itself    a s.  And  yet  the  Self  has  been  reached,  unequivocally
and unmistakably. Not only is the call meant for him to whom the appeal is
made  ‘without  regard  for  persons’,  but  even  the  caller  maintains  itself  in
conspicuous  indefiniteness.  If  the  caller  is  asked  about  its  name,  status,
origin, or repute, it not only refuses to answer, but does not even leave the
slightest possibility of one’s making it into something with which one can
be familiar when one’s understanding of Dasein has a ‘worldly’ orientation.

On  the  other  hand,  it  by  no  means  disguises  itself  in  the  call.  That  which
calls  the  call,  simply  holds  itself  aloof  from  any  way  of  becoming  well-
known, and this belongs to its phenomenal character. To let itself be drawn
into getting considered and talked about, goes against its kind of Being.(1)
The  peculiar  indefiniteness  of  the  caller  and  the  impossibility  of  making
more definite what this caller is, are not just nothing; they are distinctive for
it  in  a  positive  way.  They  make  known  to  us  that  the  caller  is  solely
absorbed in summoning us to something, that it is heard only as such, and
furthermore  that  it  will  not  let  itself  be  coaxed.  But  if  so,  is  it  not  quite
appropriate  to  the  phenomenon  to  leave  unasked  the  question  of  what  the
caller  is?  Yes  indeed,  when  it  comes  to  listening  to  the  factical  call  of
conscience  in  an  existentiell  way,  but  not  when  it  comes  to  analysing
existentially the facticity of the calling and the existentiality of the hearing.
 

1. ‘Es geht wider die Art seines Seins, sich in ein Betrachten und Bereden ziehen zu lassen.’

But  is  it  at  all  necessary  to  keep  raising  explicitly  the  question  of  who
does  the  calling?  Is  this  not  answered  for  Dasein  just  as  unequivocally  as
the  question  of  to  whom  the  call  makes  its  appeal?  In  conscience  Dasein
calls itself. This understanding of the caller may be more or less awake in
the factical hearing of the call. Ontologically, however, it is not enough to
answer that Dasein is at the same time both the caller and the one to whom
the  appeal  is  made.  When  Dasein  is  appealed  to,  is  it  not  ‘there’  in  a
different  way  from  that  in  which  it  does  the  calling?  Shall  we  say  that  its
ownmost potentiality-for-Being-its-Self functions as the caller?

Indeed  the  call  is  precisely something which we ourselves have neither
planned nor prepared for nor voluntarily performed, nor have we ever done
so. ‘It’ calls,(1) against our expectations and even against our will. On the
other hand, the call undoubtedly does not come from someone else who is
with me in the world. The call comes from me and yet from beyond me and
over me.(2)

These phenomenal findings are not to be explained away. After all, they
have been taken as a starting-point for explaining the voice of conscience as
an  alien  power  by  which  Dasein  is  dominated.  If  the  interpretation
continues  in  this  direction,  one  supplies  a  possessor  for  the  power  thus
posited,(3)  or  one  takes  the  power  itself  as  a  person  who  makes  himself
known—namely  God.  On  the  other  hand  one  may  try  to  reject  this

explanation in which the caller is taken as an alien manifestation of such a
power, and to explain away the conscience ‘biologically’ at the same time.
Both  these  explanations  pass  over  the  phenomenal  findings  too  hastily.
Such  procedures  are  facilitated  by  the  unexpressed  but  ontologically
dogmatic guiding thesis that what is (in other words, anything so factual as
the  call)  must  be  present-at-hand,  and  that  what  does  not  let  itself  be
Objectively demonstrated as present-at-hand, just is not at all.
 

1. ‘ “Es” ruft...’ Here the pronoun ‘es’ is used quite impersonally, and does not refer back to ‘the

call’ itself (‘Der Ruf’).

2. ‘Der Ruf kommt aus mir und doch über mich.’
3. ‘…unterlegt man der festgelegten Macht einen Besitzer…’

H. 276

 

But  methodologically  this  is  too  precipitate.  We  must  instead  hold  fast
not  only  to  the  phenomenal  finding  that  I  receive  the  call  as  coming  both
from  me  and  from  beyond  me,  but  also  to  the  implication  that  this
phenomenon  is  here  delineated  ontologically  as  a  phenomenon  of  Dasein.
Only  the  existential  constitution  of  this  entity  can  afford  us  a  clue  for
Interpreting the kind of Being of the ‘it’ which does the calling.

Does our previous analysis of Dasein’s state of Being show us a way of
making  ontologically  intelligible  the  kind  of  Being  which  belongs  to  the
caller, and, along with it, that which belongs to the calling? The fact that the
call  is  not  something  which  is  explicitly  performed  by me,  but  that  rather
‘it’ does the calling, does not justify seeking the caller in some entity with a
character  other  than  that  of  Dasein.  Yet  every  Dasein  always  exists
factically.  It  is  not  a  free-floating  self-projection;  but  its  character  is
determined  by  thrownness  as  a  Fact  of  the  entity  which  it  is;  and,  as  so
determined, it has in each case already been delivered over to existence, and
it constantly so remains. Dasein’s facticity,  however,  is  essentially distinct
from the factuality of something present-at-hand. Existent Dasein does not
encounter itself as something present-at-hand within-the-world. But neither
does thrownness adhere to Dasein as an inaccessible characteristic which is
of no importance for its existence. As something thrown, Dasein has been
thrown into existence. It exists as an entity which has to be as it is and as it
can be.

That it is factically, may be obscure and hidden as regards the “why” of
it; but the “that-it-is” has itself been disclosed to Dasein.(1) The thrownness
of  this  entity  belongs  to  the  disclosedness  of  the  ‘there’  and  reveals  itself
constantly  in  its  current  state-of-mind.  This  state-of-mind  brings  Dasein,
more or less explicitly and authentically, face to face with the fact ‘that it is,
and  that  it  has  to  be  something  with  a  potentiality-for-Being  as  the  entity
which  it  is’.(2)  For  the  most  part,  however,  its  mood  is  such  that  its
thrownness gets closed off. In the face of its thrownness Dasein flees to the
relief which comes with the supposed freedom of the they-self. This fleeing
has  been  described  as  a  fleeing  in  the  face  of  the  uncanniness  which  is
basically determinative for individualized Being-in-the-world. Uncanniness
reveals itself authentically in the basic state-of-mind of anxiety; and, as the
most  elemental  way  in  which  thrown  Dasein  is  disclosed,  it  puts  Dasein’s
Being-in-the-world face to face with the “nothing” of the world; in the face
of  this  “nothing”,  Dasein  is  anxious  with  anxiety  about  its  ownmost
potentiality-for-Being. What if this Dasein, which finds itself [sich befindet]
in  the  very  depths  of  its  uncanniness,  should  be  the  caller  of  the  call  of
conscience?

Nothing  speaks  against  this;  but  all  those  phenomena  which  we  have

hitherto set forth in characterizing the caller and its calling speak for it.
 

1. ‘Dass es faktisch ist, mag hinsichtlich des Warum verborgen sein, das ‘Dass’ selbst jedoch ist

dem Dasein erschlossen.’ (Cf. H. 135 above.)

2. ‘Diese bringt das Dasein mehr oder minder ausdrücklich und eigentlich vor sein “dass es ist

und als das Seiende, das es ist, seinkönnend zu sein hat”.’

H. 277

 

In its “who”, the caller is definable in a ‘worldly’ way by nothing at all.
The  caller  is  Dasein  in  its  uncanniness:  primordial,  thrown  Being-in-the-
world  as  the  “not-at-home”—the  bare  ‘that-it-is’  in  the  “nothing”  of  the
world. The caller is unfamiliar to the everyday they-self; it is something like
an alien voice. What could be more alien to the “they”, lost in the manifold
‘world’ of its concern, than the Self which has been individualized down to
itself  in  uncanniness  and  been  thrown  into  the  “nothing”?  ‘It’  calls,  even
though it gives the concernfully curious ear nothing to hear which might be
passed  along  in  further  retelling  and  talked  about  in  public.  But  what  is
Dasein even to report from the uncanniness of its thrown Being? What else

remains  for  it  than  its  own  potentiality-for-Being  as  revealed  in  anxiety?
How  else  is  “it”  to  call  than  by  summoning  Dasein  towards  this
potentiality-for-Being, which alone is the issue?

The  call  does  not  report  events;  it  calls  without  uttering  anything.  The
call discourses in the uncanny mode of keeping silent. And it does this only
because, in calling the one to whom the appeal is made, it does not call him
into the public idle talk of the “they”, but calls him back from this into the
reticence of his existent potentiality-for-Being. When the caller reaches him
to  whom  the  appeal  is  made,  it  does  so  with  a  cold  assurance  which  is
uncanny but by no means obvious. Wherein lies the basis for this assurance
if not in the fact that when Dasein has been individualized down to itself in
its uncanniness, it is for itself something that simply cannot be mistaken for
anything else? What is it that so radically deprives Dasein of the possibility
of misunderstanding itself by any sort of alibi and failing to recognize itself,
if  not  the  forsakenness  [Verlassenheit]  with  which  it  has  been  abandoned
[Überlassenheit] to itself?

Uncanniness is the basic kind of Being-in-the-world, even though in an
everyday  way  it  has  been  covered  up.  Out  of  the  depths  of  this  kind  of
Being, Dasein itself, as conscience, calls. The ‘it calls me’ [“es ruft mich”]
is a distinctive kind of discourse for Dasein. The call whose mood has been
attuned by anxiety is what makes it possible first and foremost for Dasein to
project  itself  upon  its  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being.  The  call  of
conscience,  existentially  understood,  makes  known  for  the  first  time  what
we  have  hitherto  merely  contended:(vii)  that  uncanniness  pursues  Dasein
and is a threat to the lostness in which it has forgotten itself.
 

vii. Cf. Section 40, H. 189.

H. 278

 

The  proposition  that  Dasein  is  at  the  same  time  both  the  caller  and  the
one  to  whom  the  appeal  is  made,  has  now  lost  its  empty  formal  character
and  its  obviousness.  Conscience  manifests  itself  as  the  call  of  care:  the
caller  is  Dasein,  which,  in  its  thrownness  (in  its  Being-already-in),  is
anxious(1) about its potentiality-for-Being. The one to whom the appeal is
made is this very same Dasein, summoned to its ownmost potentiality-for-
Being (ahead of itself...). Dasein is falling into the “they” (in Being-already-

alongside the world of its concern), and it is summoned out of this falling
by  the  appeal.  The  call  of  conscience—that  is,  conscience  itself—has  its
ontological possibility in the fact that Dasein, in the very basis of its Being,
is care.
 

1.  ‘…sich  ängstigend...’  The  older  editions  have  ‘sich  ängstend’,  which  has  virtually  the  same

meaning, and is more characteristic of Heidegger’s style.

So  we  need  not  resort  to  powers  with  a  character  other  than  that  of
Dasein; indeed, recourse to these is so far from clarifying the uncanniness
of the call that instead it annihilates it. In the end, does not the reason why
‘explanations’ of the conscience have gone off the track, lie in the fact that
we have not looked long enough to establish our phenomenal findings as to
the  call,  and  that  Dasein  has  been  presupposed  as  having  some  kind  of
ontological  definiteness  or  indefiniteness,  whichever  it may  chance?  Why
should we look to alien powers for information before we have made sure
that  in  starting  our  analysis  we  have  not  given  too  low  an  assessment  of
Dasein’s Being, regarding it as an innocuous subject endowed with personal
consciousness, somehow or other occurring?

And yet, if the caller—who is ‘nobody’, when seen after the manner of
the  world—is  interpreted  as  a  power,  this  seems  to  be  a  dispassionate
recognition  of  something  that  one  can  ‘come  across  Objectively’.  When
seen  correctly,  however,  this  interpretation  is  only  a  fleeing  in  the  face  of
the conscience—a way for Dasein to escape by slinking away from that thin
wall by which the “they” is separated, as it were, from the uncanniness of
its  Being.  This  interpretation  of  the  conscience  passes  itself  off  as
recognizing the call in the sense of a voice which is ‘universally’ binding,
and  which  speaks  in  a  way  that  is  ‘not  just  subjective’.  Furthermore,  the
‘universal’ conscience becomes exalted to a ‘world-conscience’, which still
has the phenomenal character of an ‘it’ and  ‘nobody’,  yet  which  speaks—
there in the individual ‘subject’—as this indefinite something.

But  this  ‘public  conscience’—what  else  is  it  than  the  voice  of  the
“they”?  A  ‘world-conscience’  is  a  dubious  fabrication,  and  Dasein  can
come to this only because conscience, in its basis and its essence, is in each
case  mine—not  only  in  the  sense  that  in  each  case  the  appeal  is  to  one’s
ownmost potentiality-for-Being, but because the call comes from that entity
which in each case I myself am.

With this Interpretation of the caller, which is purely in accord with the
phenomenal  character  of  the  calling,  the  ‘power’  of  conscience  is  not
diminished and rendered ‘merely subjective’. On the contrary, only in this
way do the inexorability and unequivocal character of the call become free.
This Interpretation does justice to the ‘Objectivity’ of the appeal for the first
time by leaving it its ‘subjectivity’, which of course denies the they-self its
dominion.

H. 279

 

Nevertheless, this Interpretation of the conscience as the call of care will
be  countered  by  the  question  of  whether  any  interpretation  of  the
conscience can stand up if it removes itself so far from ‘natural experience’.
How  is  the  conscience  to  function  as  that  which  summons  us  to  our
ownmost  potentiality-for-Being,  when  proximally  and  for  the  most  part  it
merely warns and reproves? Does the conscience speak in so indefinite and
empty a manner about our potentiality-for-Being? Does it not  rather  speak
definitely  and  concretely  in  relation  to  failures  and  omissions  which  have
already befallen or which we still have before us? Does the alleged appeal
stem  from  a ‘bad’ conscience  or  from  a ‘good’ one?  Does  the  conscience
give us anything positive at all? Does it not function rather in just a critical
fashion?

Such  considerations  are  indisputably  within  their  rights.  We  can,
however,  demand  that  in  any  Interpretation  of  conscience  ‘one’  should
recognize  in  it  the  phenomenon  in  question  as  it  is  experienced  in  an
everyday manner. But satisfying this requirement does not mean in turn that
the ordinary ontical way of understanding conscience must be recognized as
the first court of appeal [erste Instanz] for an ontological Interpretation. On
the  other  hand,  the  considerations  which  we  have  just  marshalled  remain
premature as long as the analysis of conscience to which they pertain falls
short of its goal. Hitherto we have merely tried to trace back conscience as
a phenomenon of Dasein to the ontological constitution of that entity. This
has served to prepare us for the task of making the conscience intelligible as
an  attestation  of  Dasein’s  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being—an  attestation
which lies in Dasein itself.

But what the conscience attests becomes completely definite only when
we  have  delimited  plainly  enough  the  character  of  the  hearing  which

genuinely  corresponds  to  the  calling.  The  authentic  understanding  which
‘follows’  the  call  is  not  a  mere  addition  which  attaches  itself  to  the
phenomenon  of  conscience  by  a  process  which  may  or  may  not  be
forthcoming.  Only  from an  understanding  of  the  appeal  and  together  with
such  an  understanding  does  the  full Experience  of  conscience  let  itself  be
grasped. If in each case the caller and he to whom the appeal is made are at
the same time one’s own Dasein themselves, then in any failure to hear the
call or any incorrect hearing of oneself, there lies a definite kind of Dasein’s
Being.  A  free-floating  call  from  which  ‘nothing  ensues’  is  an  impossible
fiction when seen existentially. With regard to Dasein, ‘that nothing ensues’
signifies something positive.

H. 280

 

 

So then, only by analysing the way the appeal is understood can one be
led  to  discuss  explicitly  what  the  call  gives  one  to  understand.  But  only
with  our  foregoing  general  ontological  characterization  of  the  conscience
does  it  become  possible  to  conceive  existentially  the  conscience’s  call  of
‘Guilty!’(1) All experiences and interpretations of the conscience are at one
in that they make the ‘voice’ of conscience speak somehow of ‘guilt’.

58. Understanding the Appeal, and Guilt

To grasp phenomenally what one hears in understanding the appeal, we
must  go  back  to  the  appeal  anew.  The  appeal  to  the  they-self  signifies
summoning one’s ownmost Self to its potentiality-for-Being, and of course
as  Dasein—that  is,  as  concernful  Being-in-the-world  and  Being  with
Others.  Thus  in  Interpreting  existentially  that  towards  which  the  call
summons  us,  we  cannot  seek  to  delimit  any  concrete  single  possibility  of
existence  as 
the  methodological
possibilities and tasks which such an Interpretation implies. That which can
be established, and which seeks to be established, is not what gets called in
and  to  each  particular  Dasein  from  an  existentiell  standpoint,  but  is  rather
what belongs to  the existential  condition  for  the  possibility of  its  factical-
existentiell potentiality-for-Being.(2)

long  as  we  correctly  understand 

When  the  call  is  understood  with  an  existentiell  kind  of  hearing,  such
understanding is more authentic the more non-relationally Dasein hears and
understands its own Being-appealed-to, and the less the meaning of the call
gets perverted by what one says or by what is fitting and accepted [was sich
gehört und gilt]. But what is it that is essentially implied when the appeal is
understood  authentically?  What  is  it  that  has  been  essentially  given  us  to
understand  in  the  call  at  any  particular  time,  even  if  factically  it  has  not
always been understood?

We have already answered this question, however, in our thesis that the
call ‘says’ nothing which might be talked about, gives no information about
events.  The  call  points  forward  to  Dasein’s  potentiality-for-Being,  and  it
does  this  as  a  call  which  comes  from uncanniness.(3)  The  caller  is,  to  be
sure,  indefinite;  but  the  “whence”  from  which  it  calls  does  not  remain  a
matter  of  indifference  for  the  calling.  This  “whence”—the  uncanniness  of
thrown  individualization—gets  called  too  [mitgerufen]  in  the  calling;  that
is, it too gets disclosed [miterschlossen]. In calling forth to something, the
“whence” of the calling is the “whither” to which we are called back. When
the call gives us a potentiality-for-Being to understand, it does not give us
one  which  is  ideal  and  universal;  it  discloses  it  as  that  which  has  been
currently  individualized  and  which  belongs  to  that  particular  Dasein.  We
have  not  fully  determined  the  character  of  the  call  as  disclosure  until  we
understand it as one which calls us back in calling us forth [als vorrufender
Rückruf].  If  we  take  the  call  this  way  and  orient  ourselves  by  it,  we  must
first ask what it gives us to understand.
 

1.  ‘…das  im  Gewissen  gerufene  “schuldig”  existenzial  zu  begreifen.’  As  Heidegger  will  point
out,  the  words  ‘schuldig’,  ‘Schuld’  and  their  derivatives  have  many  different  meanings,
corresponding not only to ‘indebtedness’, as we have seen on H. 242 above, but also to ‘guilt’ and
‘responsibility’.  In  the  present  chapter  we  shall  translate  them  by  ‘guilty’  and  ‘guilt’  whenever
possible, even though these expressions will not always be entirely appropriate.

2.  ‘Nicht  das  je  existenziell  im  jeweiligen  Dasein  in  dieses  Gerufene  kann  und  will  fixiert
werden, sondern das, was zur existenzialen Bedingung der Möglichkeit des je faktischexistenziellen
Seinkönnens  gehört.’  In  the  older  editions  we  find  ‘an  dieses’  rather  than  ‘in  dieses’,  and  ‘zur’
appears in spaced type.

3. ‘Der Ruf weist das Dasein vor auf sein Seinkönnen und das als Ruf aus der Unheimlichkeit.’

H. 281

 

But  is  not  the  question  of  what  the  call  says  answered  more  easily  and
surely if we ‘simply’ allude to what we generally hear or fail to hear in any

experience  of  conscience:  namely,  that  the  call  either  addresses  Dasein  as
‘Guilty!’, or, as in the case when the conscience gives warning, refers to a
possible ‘Guilty!’, or affirms, as a ‘good’ conscience, that one is ‘conscious
of  no  guilt’?  Whatever  the  ways  in  which  conscience  is  experienced  or
interpreted, all our experiences ‘agree’ on this ‘Guilty!’. If only it were not
defined  in  such  wholly  different  ways!  And  even  if  the  meaning  of  this
‘Guilty!’ should let itself be taken in a way upon which everyone is agreed,
the existential  conception of  this  Being-guilty  would  still  remain  obscure.
Yet if Dasein addresses itself as ‘Guilty!’, whence could it draw its idea of
guilt  except  from  the  Interpretation  of  its  own  Being?  All  the  same,  the
question  arises  anew:  who  says  how  we  are  guilty  and  what  “guilt”
signifies? On  the  other  hand,  the  idea  of  guilt  is  not  one  which  could  be
thought up arbitrarily and forced upon Dasein. If any understanding of the
essence  of  guilt  is  possible  at  all,  then  this  possibility  must  have  been
sketched out in Dasein beforehand. How are we to find the trail which can
lead  to  revealing  this  phenomenon?  All  ontological  investigations  of  such
phenomena  as  guilt,  conscience,  and  death,  must  start  with  what  the
everyday  interpretation  of  Dasein  ‘says’  about  them.  Because  Dasein  has
falling as its kind of Being, the way Dasein gets interpreted is for the most
part  inauthentically  ‘oriented’  and  does  not  reach  the  ‘essence’;  for  to
Dasein  the  primordially  appropriate  ontological  way  of  formulating
questions  remains  alien.  But  whenever  we  see  something  wrongly,  some
injunction as to the primordial ‘idea’ of the phenomenon is revealed along
with  it.  Where,  however,  shall  we  get  our  criterion  for  the  primordial
existential meaning of the ‘Guilty!’? From the fact that this ‘Guilty!’ turns
up  as  a  predicate  for  the  ‘I  am’.  Is  it  possible  that  what  is  understood  as
‘guilt’ in our inauthentic interpretation lies in Dasein’s Being as such, and
that it does so in such a way that so far as any Dasein factically exists, it is
also guilty?

Thus by invoking the ‘Guilty!’ which everyone agrees that he hears, one
has  not  yet  answered  the  question  of  the  existential  meaning  of  what  has
been called in the call. What has been called must first be conceptualized if
we are to understand what the call of ‘Guilty!’ means, and why and how it
becomes  perverted  in  its  signification  by  the  everyday  way  of  interpreting
it.

H. 282

 

Everyday  common  sense  first  takes  ‘Being-guilty’  in  the  sense  of
‘owing’,  of  ‘having  something  due  on  account’.(1)  One  is  to  give  back  to
the Other something to which the latter has a claim. This ‘Being-guilty’ as
‘having  debts’  [“Schulden  haben”]  is  a  way  of  Being  with  Others  in  the
field  of  concern,  as  in  providing  something  or  bringing  it  along.  Other
modes  of  such  concern  are:  depriving,  borrowing,  withholding,  taking,
stealing—failing to satisfy, in some way or other, the claims which Others
have  made  as  to  their  possessions.  This  kind  of  Being-guilty  is  related  to
that with which one can concern oneself.

“Being-guilty”  also  has  the  signification  of  ‘being  responsible  for’
[“schuld sein an”]—that is, being the cause or author of something, or even
‘being the occasion’ for something. In this sense of ‘having responsibility’
for something, one can ‘be guilty’ of something without ‘owing’ anything
to someone else or coming to ‘owe’ him. On the other hand, one can owe
something  to  another  without  being  responsible  for  it  oneself.  Another
person can ‘incur debts’ with Others ‘for me’.(2)

These  ordinary  significations  of  “Being-guilty”  as  ‘having  debts  to
someone’  and  ‘having  responsibility  for  something’  can  go  together  and
define a kind of behaviour which we call ‘making oneself responsible’; that
is, by having the responsibility for having a debt, one may break a law and
make oneself punishable.(3) Yet the requirement which one fails to satisfy
need not necessarily be related to anyone’s possessions; it can regulate the
very  manner  in  which  we  are  with  one  other  publicly.  ‘Making  oneself
responsible’ by breaking a law, as we have thus defined it, can indeed also
have the character of ‘coming to owe something to Others’.(4)
 

1. ‘Die alltägliche Verständigkeit nimmt das “Schuldigsein” zunächst im Sinne von “schulden”,
“bei  einem  etwas  an  Brett  haben”.’  While  this  represents  a  very  familiar  usage  of  the  German
‘Schuldigsein’, it of course does not represent a ‘common-sense’ usage of the English ‘Being-guilty’,
which comes from an entirely different stem.

2.  ‘Im  Sinne  dieses  “Schuld  habens”  an  etwas  kann  man  “schuldig  sein”,  ohne  einem  Andern
etwas  zu  “schulden”  oder  “schuldig”  zu  werden.  Umgekehrt  kann  man  einem  Andern  etwas
schulden,  ohne  selbst  schuld  daran  zu  sein.  Ein  Anderer  kann  bei  Anderen  “für  mich”  “Schulden
machen”.’ On ‘ “schuldig” zu werden’, Cf. our note 1, H. 287 below.

3.  ‘...das  wir  nennen  “sich  schuldig  machen”,  das  heisst  durch  das  Schuldhaben  an  einem

Schuldenhaben ein Recht verletzen und sich strafbar machen.’

4. ‘…eines “Schuldigwerdens an Anderen”.’

This  does  not  happen  merely  through  law-breaking  as  such,  but  rather
through my having the responsibility for the Other’s becoming endangered
in  his  existence,  led  astray,  or  even  ruined.  This  way  of  coming  to  owe
something to Others is possible without breaking the ‘public’ law. Thus the
formal  conception  of  “Being-guilty”  in  the  sense  of  having  come  to  owe
something  to  an  Other,  may  be  defined  as  follows:  “Being-the-basis for  a
lack of something in the Dasein of an Other, and in such a manner that this
very Being-the-basis determines itself as ‘lacking in some way’ in terms of
that for which it is the basis.”(1) This kind of lacking is a failure to satisfy
some requirement which applies to one’s existent Being with Others.

H. 283

 

the  contrary, 

We need not consider how such requirements arise and in what way their
character  as  requirements  and  laws  must  be  conceived  by  reason  of  their
having  such  a  source.  In  any  case,  “Being-guilty”  in  the  sense  last
mentioned,  the  breach  of  a  ‘moral  requirement’,  is  a  kind  of  Being  which
belongs  to  Dasein.  Of  course  this  holds  good  also  for  “Being-guilty”  as
‘making  oneself  punishable’  and  as  ‘having  debts’,  and  for  any  ‘having
responsibility  for...’.  These  too  are  ways  in  which  Dasein  behaves.  If  one
takes  ‘laden  with  moral  guilt’  as  a  ‘quality’  of  Dasein,  one  has  said  very
little.  On 
that  such  a
this  only  makes 
characterization  does  not  suffice  for  distinguishing  ontologically  between
this  kind  of  ‘attribute  of  Being’  for  Dasein  and  those  other  ways  of
behaving which we have just listed. After all, the concept of moral guilt has
been  so  little  clarified  ontologically  that  when  the  idea  of  deserving
punishment, or even of having debts to someone, has also been included in
this concept, or when these ideas have been employed in the very defining
of it, such interpretations of this phenomenon could become prevalent and
have  remained  so.  But  therewith  the  ‘Guilty!’  gets  thrust  aside  into  the
domain of concern in the sense of reckoning up claims and balancing them
off.

it  manifest 

The  phenomenon  of  guilt,  which  is  not  necessarily  related  to  ‘having
debts’ and law-breaking, can be clarified only if we first inquire in principle
into  Dasein’s  Being-guilty—in  other  words,  if  we  conceive  the  idea  of
‘Guilty!’ in terms of Dasein’s kind of Being.

If this is our goal, the idea of ‘Guilty!’ must be sufficiently formalized so
that  those  ordinary  phenomena  of  “guilt”  which  are  related  to  our
concernful Being with Others, will drop out. The idea of guilt must not only
be raised above the domain of that concern in which we reckon things up,
but it must also be detached from relationship to any law or “ought” such
that by failing to comply with it one loads himself with guilt. For here too
“guilt” is still necessarily defined as a lack—when something which ought
to be and which can be is missing.(2) To be missing, however, means not-
the  not-Being-present-at-hand  of
Being-present-at-hand.  A 
something which ought to be, is a definite sort of Being which goes with the
present-at-hand.  In  this  sense  it  is  essential  that  in  existence  there  can  be
nothing  lacking,  not  because  it  would  then  be  perfect,  but  because  its
character of Being remains distinct from any presence-at-hand.
 

lack,  as 

1. ‘...Grundsein für einen Mangel im Dasein eines Andern, so zwar, dass dieses Grundsein selbst

sich aus seinem Wofür als “mangelhaft” bestimmt.’

2. ‘...auf ein Sollen und Gesetz, wogegen sich verfehlend jemand Schuld auf sich lädt. Denn auch
hier wird die Schuld notwendig noch als Mangel bestimmt, als Fehlen von etwas, was sein soll und
kann.’

H. 284

 

Nevertheless, in the idea of ‘Guilty!’ there lies the character of the “not”.
If the ‘Guilty!’ is something that can definitely apply to existence, then this
raises  the  ontological  problem  of  clarifying  existentially  the  character  of
this  “not”  as  a  “not”. Moreover,  to  the  idea  of  ‘Guilty!’  belongs  what  is
expressed  without  further  differentiation  in  the  conception  of  guilt  as
‘having  responsibility  for’—that  is,  as  Being-the  basis  for...  Hence  we
define the formally existential idea of the ‘Guilty!’ as “Being-the-basis for a
Being  which  has  been  defined  by  a  ‘not’  ”—that  is  to  say,  as  “Being-the-
basis  of  a  nullity”.(1)  The  idea  of  the  “not”  which  lies  in  the  concept  of
guilt  as  understood  existentially,  excludes  relatedness  to  anything  present-
at-hand  which  is  possible  or  which  may  have  been  required;  furthermore,
Dasein  is  altogether  incommensurable  with  anything  present-at-hand  or
generally accepted [Geltenden] which is not it itself, or which is not in the
way  Dasein  is—namely,  existing;  so  any  possibility  that,  with  regard  to
Being-the-basis  for  a lack, the  entity  which is  itself such a basis might  be
reckoned up as ‘lacking in some manner’, is a possibility which drops out.

If a lack, such as failure to fulfil some requirement, has been ‘caused’ in a
manner  characteristic  of  Dasein,  we  cannot  simply  reckon  back  to  there
being something lacking [Mangelhaftigkeit] in the ‘cause’. Being-the-basis-
for-something  need  not  have  the  same  “not”-character  as  the  privativum
which is based upon it and which arises from it. The basis need not acquire
a nullity of its own from that for which it is the basis [seinem Begründeten].
This  implies,  however,  that  Being-guilty  does  not  first  result  from  an
indebtedness  [Verschuldung],  but  that,  on  the  contrary,  indebtedness
becomes  possible  only  ‘on  the  basis’  of  a  primordial  Being-guilty.  Can
something  like  this  be  exhibited  in  Dasein’s  Being,  and  how  is  it  at  all
possible existentially?
 

1.  ‘…Grundsein  für  ein  durch  ein  Nicht  bestimmtes  Sein—das  heisst  Grundsein  einer
Nichtigkeit’. The noun ‘Nichtigkeit’ which might well be translated here as ‘notness’, may be used in
legal contexts where something has been declared ‘null and void’, and can be used more generally to
apply to almost anything that is vacuous, trifling, ephemeral, or ‘nil’. Heidegger will rule out some of
these connotations on H. 285.

Dasein’s  Being  is  care.  It  comprises  in  itself  facticity  (thrownness),
existence (projection),  and falling. As  being,  Dasein is  something that has
been thrown; it has been brought into its “there”, but not of its own accord.
As  being,  it  has  taken  the  definite  form  of  a  potentiality-for-Being  which
has  heard  itself  and  has  devoted  itself  to  itself,  but  not  as  itself.(1)  As
existent,  it  never  comes  back  behind  its  thrownness  in  such  a  way  that  it
might first release this ‘that-it-is-and-has-to-be’ from its Being-its-Self  and
lead it into the “there”. Thrownness, however, does not lie behind it as some
event  which  has  happened  to  Dasein,  which  has  factually  befallen  and
fallen  loose  from  Dasein  again;(2)  on  the  contrary,  as  long  as  Dasein  is,
Dasein,  as  care,  is  constantly  its  ‘that-it-is’.  To  this  entity  it  has  been
delivered over, and as such it can exist solely as the entity which it is; and
as this entity to which it has been thus delivered over, it is,  in  its existing,
the  basis  of  its  potentiality-for-Being.  Although  it  has  not  laid  that  basis
itself, it reposes in the weight of it, which is made manifest to it as a burden
by Dasein’s mood.

And how is Dasein this thrown basis? Only in that it projects itself upon
possibilities into which it has been thrown. The Self, which as such has to
lay  the  basis for  itself, can never get  that  basis  into  its  power;  and  yet,  as

existing, it must take over Being-a-basis. To be its own thrown basis is that
potentiality-for-Being which is the issue for care.

H. 285

 

In being a basis—that is, in existing as thrown—Dasein constantly lags
behind its possibilities. It is never existent before its basis, but only from it
and as this  basis.  Thus  “Being-a-basis”  means  never  to  have  power  over
one’s  ownmost  Being  from  the  ground  up.  This  “not”  belongs  to  the
existential meaning of “thrownness”. It itself, being a basis, is  a nullity  of
itself.(3) “Nullity” does not signify anything like not-Being-present-at-hand
or  not-subsisting;  what  one  has  in  view  here  is  rather  a  “not”  which  is
constitutive for this Being of Dasein—its thrownness. The character of this
“not” as a “not” may be defined existentially: in being its Self, Dasein is, as
a Self, the entity that has been thrown. It has been released from its basis,
not through itself but to itself; so as to be as this basis. Dasein is not itself
the  basis  of  its  Being,  inasmuch  as  this  basis  first  arises  from  its  own
projection; rather, as Being-its-Self, it is the Being of its basis.(4) This basis
is never anything but the basis for an entity whose Being has to take over
Being-a-basis.
 

1. ‘Seiend ist es als Seinkönnen bestimmt, das sich selbst gehört und doch nicht als es selbst sich
zu eigen gegeben hat.’ It is perhaps tempting to interpret ‘gehört’ as coming from the verb ‘gehören’
(‘belong’)  rather  than ‘hören’ (‘hear’);  we could then read  ‘belongs  to itself’rather  than ‘has heard
itself’. Our version, however, seems to be favoured by the grammar of this passage.

2. ‘Die Geworfenheit aber liegt nicht hinter ihm als ein tatsächlich vorgefallenes und vom Dasein

wieder losgefallenes Ereignis, das mit ihm geschah…’

3.  ‘Es  ist  nie  existent  vor  seinem  Grunde,  sondern  je  nur  aus  ihm  und  als  dieser.  Grundsein
besagt  demnach,  des  eigensten  Seins  von  Grund  auf  nie  mächtig  sein.  Dieses  Nicht  gehört  zum
existenzialen  Sinn  der  Geworfenheit.  Grund-seiend  ist  es  selbst  eine  Nichtigkeit  seiner  selbst.’
Presumably the ‘not’ to which Heidegger refers in this puzzling passage, is implied in the ‘never’ of
the preceding sentence.

4.  ‘…Selbst  seiend  ist  das  Dasein  das  geworfene  Seiende  als  Selbst.  Nicht  durch  es  selbst,
sondern an es selbst entlassen aus dem Grunde, um als dieser zu sein. Das Dasein ist nicht insofern
selbst  der  Grund  seines  Seins,  als  dieser  aus  eigenem  Entwurf  erst  entspringt,  wohl  aber  ist  es  als
Selbstsein das Sein des Grundes.’

Dasein  is  its  basis  existently—that  is,  in  such  a  manner  that  it
understands itself in terms of possibilities, and, as so understanding itself, is
that  entity  which  has  been  thrown.  But  this  implies  that  in  having  a
potentiality-for-Being  it  always  stands  in  one  possibility  or  another:  it

constantly is not other possibilities, and it has waived these in its existentiell
projection.  Not  only  is  the  projection,  as  one  that  has  been  thrown,
determined  by  the  nullity  of  Being-a-basis;  as  projection  it  is  itself
essentially  null.  This  does  not  mean  that  it  has  the  ontical  property  of
‘inconsequentiality’  or  ‘worthlessness’;  what  we  have  here  is  rather
something  existentially  constitutive  for  the  structure  of  the  Being  of
projection. The nullity we have in mind belongs to Dasein’s Being-free for
its existentiell possibilities. Freedom, however, is only in the choice of  o n
e  possibility—that is, in tolerating one’s not having chosen the others and
one’s not being able to choose them.

In  the  structure  of  thrownness,  as  in  that  of  projection,  there  lies
essentially  a  nullity.  This  nullity  is  the  basis  for  the  possibility  of
inauthentic  Dasein  in  its  falling;  and  as  falling,  every  inauthentic  Dasein
factically  is.  Care  itself,  in  its  very  essence,  is  permeated  with  nullity
through  and  through.  Thus  “care”—Dasein’s  Being—means,  as  thrown
projection,  Being-the-basis  of  a  nullity  (and  this  Being-the-basis  is  itself
null).  This  means that Dasein  as  such  is  guilty,  if  our  formally  existential
definition of “guilt” as “Being-the-basis of a nullity” is indeed correct.

Existential  nullity  has  by  no  means  the  character  of  a  privation,  where
something is lacking in comparison with an ideal which has been set up but
does  not  get  attained  in  Dasein;  rather,  the  Being  of  this  entity  is  already
null as projection; and it is null in advance of [vor] any of the things which
it can project and which it mostly attains.(1) This nullity, moreover, is thus
not something which emerges in Dasein occasionally, attaching itself to it as
an  obscure  quality  which  Dasein  might  eliminate  if  it  made  sufficient
progress.
 

1. The negative character to which Heidegger here calls attention is not brought out as clearly by
the  word  ‘projection’  (etymologically,  ‘throwing  forward’)  as  it  is  by  the  German  ‘entwerfen’
(‘throwing off’ or ‘throwing away’), where the prefix ‘ent-’ indicates separation.

H. 286

 

In spite of this, the ontological meaning of the notness [Nichtheit] of this
existential  nullity  is  still  obscure.  But  this  holds  also  for  the  ontological
essence  of  the  “not”  in  general.  Ontology  and  logic,  to  be  sure,  have
exacted  a  great  deal  from  the  “not”,  and  have  thus  made  its  possibilities
visible  in  a  piecemeal  fashion;  but  it  itself  has  not  been  unveiled

ontologically. Ontology came across the “not” and made use of it. But is it
so obvious  that every  “not”  signifies  something negative  in  the  sense  of a
lack? Is its positivity exhausted by the fact that it constitutes ‘passing over’
something? Why does all dialectic take refuge in negation, though it cannot
provide dialectical grounds for this sort of thing itself, or even just establish
it as a problem? Has anyone ever made a problem of the ontological source
of notness, or, prior to that, even sought the mere conditions on the basis of
which  the  problem  of  the  “not”  and  its  notness  and  the  possibility  of  that
notness can be raised? And how else are these conditions to be found except
by taking the meaning of Being in general as a theme and clarifying it?

The  concepts  of  privation  and  lack—which,  moreover,  are  not  very
transparent—are already insufficient for the ontological Interpretation of the
phenomenon of guilt, though if we take them formally enough, we can put
them  to  considerable  use.  Least  of  all  can  we  come  any  closer  to  the
existential phenomenon of guilt by taking our orientation from the idea of
evil, the malum as privatio boni. Just as the  b o n u m  and its privatio have
the  same  ontological  origin  in  the  ontology  of  the  present-at-hand,  this
ontology  also  applies  to  the  idea  of  ‘value’,  which  has  been  ‘abstracted’
from these.

Not only can entities whose Being is care load themselves with factical
guilt,  but  they are guilty  in  the  very  basis  of  their  Being;  and  this  Being-
guilty  is  what  provides,  above  all,  the  ontological  condition  for  Dasein’s
ability  to  come  to    o  w  e    anything  in  factically  existing.  This  essential
the
Being-guilty 
possibility of the ‘morally’ good and for that of the ‘morally’ evil—that is,
for  morality  in  general  and  for  the  possible  forms  which  this  may  take
factically.  The  primordial  “Being-guilty”  cannot  be  defined  by  morality,
since morality already presupposes it for itself.

the  existential  condition  for 

is,  equiprimordially, 

But  what  kind  of  experience  speaks  for  this  primordial  Being-guilty
which belongs to Dasein? Nor may we forget the counter-question: ‘is’ guilt
‘there’  only  if  a  consciousness  of  guilt  gets  awakened,  or  does  not  the
primordial  Being-guilty(1)  make  itself  known  rather  in  the  very  fact  that
guilt is ‘asleep’? That this primordial Being-guilty remains proximally and
for the most part undisclosed, that it is kept closed off by Dasein’s falling
Being,  reveals  only  the  aforesaid  nullity.  Being-guilty  is  more  primordial
than any knowledge about it. And only because Dasein is guilty in the basis
of  its  Being,  and  closes  itself  off  from  itself  as  something  thrown  and

falling, is conscience possible, if indeed the call gives us this Being-guilty
as something which at bottom we are to understand.
 

1. ‘Schuldigsein’. In the earlier editions the ‘sein’ is emphasized by having the type spaced out.

H. 287

 

The call is the call of care. Being-guilty constitutes the Being to which
we  give  the  name  of  “care”.  In  uncanniness  Dasein  stands  together  with
itself  primordially.  Uncanniness  brings  this  entity  face  to  face  with  its
undisguised  nullity,  which  belongs  to  the  possibility  of  its  ownmost
potentiality-for-Being. To the extent that for Dasein, as care, its Being is an
issue, it summons itself as a “they” which is factically falling, and summons
itself from its uncanniness towards its potentiality-for-Being.(1) The appeal
calls  back  by  calling  forth:(2)  it  calls  Dasein  forth  to  the  possibility  of
taking over, in existing, even that thrown entity which it is; it calls Dasein
back to its thrownness so as to understand this thrownness as the null basis
which  it  has  to  take  up  into  existence.  This  calling-back  in  which
conscience  calls  forth,  gives  Dasein  to  understand  that  Dasein  itself—the
null basis for its null projection, standing in the possibility of its Being—is
to bring itself back to itself from its lostness in the “they”; and this means
that it is guilty.

But in that case the sort of thing which Dasein gives itself to understand
would  be  information  about  itself.  And  the  hearing  which  corresponds  to
such a call would be a taking cognizance of the Fact that one is ‘guilty’. If,
however, the call is to have the character of a summons, does not this way
of interpreting the conscience lead to a complete perversion of its function?
Does not a “summons to Being-guilty” mean a summons to evil?

One would not want to impose upon the conscience such a meaning for
the “call”, even in the most violent of Interpretations. But if not, what does
it mean to ‘summon one to Being-guilty’?

The meaning of the “call” becomes plain if, in our understanding of it,
we stick to the existential sense of “Being-guilty”, instead of making basic
the derivative conception of guilt in the sense of an indebtedness which has
‘arisen’  through  some  deed  done  or  left  undone.  Such  a  demand  is  not
arbitrary,  if  the  call  of  conscience,  coming  from  Dasein  itself,  is  directed
towards that entity alone. But if so, the “summons to Being-guilty” signifies

a calling-forth to that potentiality-for-Being which in each case I as Dasein
am  already.  Dasein  need  not  first  load  a  ‘guilt’  upon  itself  through  its
failures or omissions; it must only be ‘guilty’ authentically—‘guilty’ in the
way in which it is.(3)
 

1.  We  follow  the  newer  editions  in  reading:  ‘...ruft  es  aus  der  Unheimlichkeit  sich  selbst  als
faktisch-verfallendes  Man  auf  zu  seinem  Seinkönnen.’  This  is  apparently  a  correction  of  the  older
version, where one finds ‘Man selbst’ instead of ‘Man’, and might be tempted to construe this as a
misprint for ‘Man-selbst’ (‘they-self’).

3. ‘...es soll nur das “schuldig”—als welches es ist—eigentlith sein.’

Hearing 

tantamount 

the  appeal  correctly 

to  having  an
is 
understanding of oneself in one’s ownmost potentiality-for-Being—that is,
to  projecting  oneself  upon  one’s  ownmost  authentic  potentiality  for
becoming guilty.(1) When Dasein understandingly lets itself be called forth
to this possibility, this includes its becoming free for the call—its readiness
for the potentiality of getting appealed to. In understanding the call, Dasein
is  in  thrall  to  [hörig]  its  ownmost  possibility  of  existence.  It  has  chosen
itself.
 

1. ‘Schuldigwerdenkönnen’. This ‘ownmost authentic’ sense of ‘schuldig werden’ is presumably
to be contrasted with the sense to which we have called attention in notes 2 and 4, H. 282 above, and
which we have expressed by the phrase ‘come to owe’. When it seems to us that Heidegger has the
authentic  sense  in  mind,  we  shall  express  it  by  the  phrase  ‘become  guilty’,  though  this  device
exaggerates a contrast which would not be felt so sharply by the German reader.

H. 288

 

In so choosing, Dasein makes possible its ownmost Being-guilty, which
remains  closed  off  from  the  they-self.  The  common  sense  of  the  “they”
knows  only  the  satisfying  of  manipulable  rules  and  public  norms  and  the
failure to satisfy them. It reckons up infractions of them and tries to balance
them off. It has slunk away from its ownmost Being-guilty so as to be able
to  talk more loudly about  making “mistakes”.  But in  the  appeal, the  they-
self  gets  called  to  [angerufen]  the  ownmost  Being-guilty  of  the  Self.
Understanding the call is choosing; but it is not a choosing of conscience,
which as such cannot be chosen. What is chosen is having-a-conscience as
Being-free  for  one’s  ownmost  Being-guilty.  “Understanding  the  appeal”
means “wanting to have a conscience”.

This does not mean that one wants to have a ‘good conscience’, still less
that one cultivates the call voluntarily; it means solely that one is ready to
be appealed to. Wanting to have a conscience is just as far from seeking out
one’s  factical  indebtednesses  as  it  is  from  the  tendency  to  liberation  from
guilt in the sense of the essential ‘guilty’.

Wanting  to  have  a  conscience  is  rather  the  most  primordial  existentiell
presupposition for the possibility of factically coming to owe something. In
understanding the call, Dasein lets its ownmost Self take action in itself [in
sich handeln] in  terms  of  that  potentiality-for-Being  which  it  has  chosen.
Only  so  can  it  be  answerable  [verantwortlich].  Factically,  however,  any
taking-action is necessarily ‘conscienceless’, not only because it may fail to
avoid some factical moral indebtedness, but because, on the null basis of its
null projection, it has, in Being with Others, already become guilty towards
them. Thus one’s wanting-to-have-a-conscience becomes the taking-over of
that  essential  consciencelessness  within  which  alone  the  existentiell
possibility of being ‘good’ subsists.

Though  the  call  gives  no  information,  it  is  not  merely  critical;  it  is
positive, in that it discloses Dasein’s most primordial potentiality-for-Being
as  Being-guilty.  Thus  conscience  manifests  itself  as  an  attestation  which
belongs to Dasein’s Being—an attestation in which conscience calls Dasein
itself  face  to  face  with  its  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being.  Is  there  an
existentially  more  concrete  way  of  determining  the  character  of  the
authentic potentiality-for-Being which has thus been attested? But now that
we have exhibited a potentiality-for-Being which is attested in Dasein itself,
a preliminary question arises: can we claim sufficient evidential weight for
the  way  we  have  exhibited  this,  as  long  as  the  embarrassment  of  our
Interpreting  the  conscience  in  a  one-sided  manner  by  tracing  it  back  to
Dasein’s constitution while hastily passing over all the familiar findings of
the ordinary interpretation of conscience, is one that is still undiminished?
Is, then, the phenomenon of conscience, as it ‘actually’ is, still recognizable
at all in the Interpretation we have given? Have we not been all too sure of
ourselves in the ingenuousness with which we have deduced an idea of the
conscience from Dasien’s state of Being?

H. 289

 

The  final  step  of  our  Interpretation  of  the  conscience  is  the  existential
delimitation  of  the  authentic  potentiality-for-Being  which  conscience
attests.  If  we  are  to  assure  ourselves  of  a  way  of  access  which  will  make
such a step possible even for the ordinary understanding of the conscience,
we  must  explicitly  demonstrate  the  connection  between  the  results  of  our
ontological  analysis  and  the  everyday  ways  in  which  the  conscience  is
experienced.

59.  The  Existential  Interpretation  of  the  Conscience,  and  the  Way

Conscience is Ordinarily Interpreted
 

1. ‘Die existenziale Interpretation des Gewissens und die vulgäre Gewissensauslegung’.

Conscience  is  the  call  of  care  from  the  uncanniness  of  Being-in-the-
world—the  call  which  summons  Dasein  to  its  ownmost  potentiality-for-
Being-guilty. And corresponding to this call, wanting-to-have-a-conscience
has  emerged  as  the  way  in  which  the  appeal  is  understood.  These  two
definitions  cannot  be  brought  into  harmony  at  once  with  the  ordinary
interpretation of conscience. Indeed they seem to be in direct conflict with
it.  We  call  this  interpretation  of  conscience  the  “ordinary”  one  [Vulgär]
because in characterizing this phenomenon and describing its ‘function’, it
sticks to what “they” know as the conscience, and how “they” follow it or
fail to follow it.

But  must  the  ontological  Interpretation  agree  with  the  ordinary
interpretation  at  all?  Should  not  the  latter  be,  in  principle,  ontologically
suspect?  If  indeed  Dasein  understands  itself  proximally  and  for  the  most
part in terms of that with which it concerns itself, and if it interprets all its
ways of behaving as concern, then will not there be falling and concealment
in its interpretation of that very way of its Being which, as a call, seeks to
bring  it  back  from  its  lostness  in  the  concerns  of  the  “they”?(2)
Everydayness  takes  Dasein  as  something  ready-to-hand  to  be  concerned
with—that  is,  something  that  gets  managed  and  reckoned  up.  ‘Life’  is  a
‘business’, whether or not it covers its costs.
 

2. ‘…wird es dann nicht gerade die Weise seines Seins verfallend-verdeckend auslegen, die es als
Ruf  aus  der  Verlorenheit  in  die  Besorgnisse  des  Man  zurückholen  will.’  While  we  feel  that  the
meaning of this sentence is probably as we have represented it, the grammar is quite ambiguous.

H. 290

 

And so with regard to the ordinary kind of Being of Dasein itself, there
is no guarantee that the way of interpreting conscience which springs from
it or the theories of conscience which are thus oriented, have arrived at the
right  ontological  horizon  for  its  Interpretation.  In  spite  of  this,  even  the
ordinary  experience  of  conscience  must  somehow—pre-ontologically—
reach this phenomenon. Two things follow from this: on the one hand, the
everyday  way  of  interpreting  conscience  cannot  be  accepted  as  the  final
criterion for the ‘Objectivity’ of an ontological analysis. On the other hand,
such  an  analysis  has  no  right  to  disregard  the  everyday  understanding  of
conscience  and  to  pass  over  the  anthropological,  psychological,  and
theological  theories  of  conscience  which  have  been  based  upon  it.  If
existential  analysis  has  laid  bare  the  phenomenon  of  conscience  in  its
ontological  roots,  then  precisely  in  terms  of  this  analysis  the  ordinary
interpretations must become intelligible; and they must become intelligible
not least in the ways in which they miss the phenomenon and in the reasons
why they conceal it. But since in the context of the problems of this treatise
the  analysis  of  conscience  is  merely  ancillary  to  what  is  ontologically  the
fundamental  question,  we  must  be  satisfied  with  alluding  to  the  essential
problems  when  we  characterize  the  connection  between  the  existential
Interpretation of conscience and the way it is ordinarily interpreted.

In  this  ordinary  interpretation  there  are  four  objections  which  might  be
brought up against our Interpretation of conscience as the summons of care
to Being-guilty: (1) that the function of conscience is essentially critical; (2)
that conscience always speaks in a way that is relative to some definite deed
which  has  been  performed  or  willed;  (3)  that  when  the  ‘voice’  is
experienced, it is never so radically related to Dasein’s Being; (4) that our
Interpretation  takes  no  account  of  the  basic  forms  of  the  phenomenon
—‘evil’  conscience  and  ‘good’,  that  which  ‘reproves’  and  that  which
‘warns’.

Let  us  begin  our  discussion  with  the  last  of  these  considerations.  In  all
interpretations  of  conscience,  the  ‘evil’  or  ‘bad’  conscience  gets  the
priority: conscience is primarily ‘evil’; such a conscience makes known to
us  that  in  every  experience  of  conscience  something  like  a  ‘Guilty!’  gets
experienced  first.  But  in  the  idea  of  bad  conscience,  how  is  this  making-
known of Being-evil understood? The ‘Experience of conscience’ turns up

after  the  deed  has  been  done  or  left  undone.  The  voice  follows  the
transgression and points back to that event which has befallen and by which
Dasein  has  loaded  itself  with  guilt.  If  conscience  makes  known  a  ‘Being-
guilty’, then it cannot do this by summoning us to something, but it does so
by remembering the guilt which has been incurred, and referring to it.

H. 291

 

the  phenomenon  has  been  brought  by 

But does the ‘fact’ that the voice comes afterwards, prevent the call from
being  basically  a  calling-forth?  That  the  voice  gets  taken  as  a  stirring  of
conscience which follows  after is  not  enough  to  prove  that  we  understand
the  phenomenon  of  conscience  primordially.  What  if  factical  indebtedness
were only the occasion for the factical calling of conscience? What if that
Interpretation  of the  ‘evil’  conscience which we  have described goes only
half way? That such is the case is evident from the ontological fore-having
within  whose  scope 
this
Interpretation. The voice is something that turns up; it has its position in the
sequence of Experiences which are present-at-hand, and it follows after the
Experience  of  the  deed.  But  neither  the  call,  nor  the  deed  which  has
happened, nor the guilt with which one is laden, is an occurrence with the
character of something present-at-hand which runs its course. The call has
the  kind  of  Being  which  belongs  to  care.  In  the  call  Dasein  ‘is’  ahead  of
itself  in  such  a  way  that  at  the  same  time  it  directs  itself  back  to  its
thrownness.  Only  by  first  positing  that  Dasein  is  an  interconnected
sequence  of  successive  Experiences,  is  it  possible  to  take  the  voice  as
something  which  comes  afterwards,  something  later,  which  therefore
necessarily  refers  back.  The  voice  does  call  back,  but  it  calls  beyond  the
deed which has happened, and back to the Being-guilty into which one has
been thrown, which is ‘earlier’ than any indebtedness. But at the same time,
this calling-back calls forth to Being-guilty, as something to be seized upon
in  one’s  own  existence,  so  that  authentic  existentiell  Being-guilty  only
‘follows  after’  the  call,  not  vice versa. Bad  conscience  is  basically  so  far
from just reproving and pointing back that it rather points forward(1) as it
calls  one  back  into  one’s  thrownness.  The  order  of  the  sequence  in  which
Experiences run their course does not give us the phenomenal structure of
existing.

If we cannot reach the primordial phenomenon by a characterization of
‘bad’  conscience,  still  less  can  we  do  so  by  a  characterization  of  ‘good’
conscience, whether we take this as a self-subsistent(2) form of conscience
or  as  one  which  is  essentially  founded  upon  ‘bad’  conscience.  Just  as
Dasein’s ‘Being-evil’ would be made known to us in the ‘bad’ conscience,
the ‘good’ conscience must have made known its ‘Being-good’. It is easy to
see that the conscience which used to be an ‘effluence of the divine power’
now becomes a slave of Pharisaism. Such a conscience would let a man say
of himself ‘I am good’; who else can say this than the good man himself,
and  who  would  be  less  willing  to  affirm  it?  But  if  this  impossible
conclusion  is  drawn  from  the  idea  of  the  good  conscience,  the  fact  that
‘Being-guilty” is what the conscience calls, only comes to the fore.
 

1.  ‘vorweisend’.  We have  followed  English  idiom in translating ‘vorweisen’  as ‘point forward’
and ‘vorrufen’ as ‘call forth’; but the prefix ‘vor-’ is the same in both cases, and means ‘forward’ as
opposed to ‘backward’.

2 .‘selbständige’. See note 1, H. 117 and note 1, H. 303.

H. 292

 

To escape this conclusion, the “good’ conscience has been Interpreted as
a  privation  of  the  ‘bad’  one,  and  defined  as  ‘an  Experienced  lack  of  bad
conscience’.(viii) This would make it an experience of not having the call
turn up—that is, of my having nothing with which to reproach myself. But
how  is  such  a  ‘lack’  ‘Experienced’?  This  supposed  Experience  is  by  no
means the experiencing of a call; it is rather a making-certain(1) that a deed
attributed  to  Dasein  has  not  been  perpetrated  by  it  and  that  Dasein  is
therefore not guilty. Becoming certain that one has not done something, has
by  no  means  the  character  of  a  conscience-phenomenon.  It  can,  however,
signify rather that one is forgetting one’s conscience—in other words, that
one is emerging from the possibility of being able to be appealed to. In the
‘certainty’  here  mentioned  lurks  the  tranquillizing  suppression  of  one’s
wanting to have a conscience—that is, of understanding one’s ownmost and
constant  Being-guilty.  The  ‘good’  conscience  is  neither  a  self-subsistent
form of conscience, nor a founded form of conscience; in short, it is not a
conscience-phenomenon at all.

found on page 335 of the fourth edition, Francke Verlag, Bern, 1954—Tr.]
 

1.  In  this  paragraph  Heidegger  takes  pains  to  disassociate  ‘Gewissen’  (‘conscience’)  from  the
(‘making  certain’),

its  derivatives—‘Sichvergewissern’ 

adjective 
‘Gewisswerden’ (‘becoming certain’), and ‘Gewissheit’ (‘certainty’).

(‘certain’)  and 

‘gewiss’ 

In so far as talk about a ‘good’ conscience arises from everyday Dasein’s
way  of  experiencing  the  conscience,  everyday  Dasein  merely  betrays
thereby that even when it speaks of the ‘bad’ conscience it basically fails to
reach  the  phenomenon.  For  the  idea  of  the  ‘bad’  conscience  is  oriented
factically  by  that  of  the  ‘good’  conscience.  The  everyday  interpretation
keeps  within  the  dimension  of  concernfully  reckoning  up  ‘guilt’  and
‘innocence’ [“Unschuld”] and balancing them off. This, then, is the horizon
within which the voice of conscience gets ‘Experienced’.

In  characterizing  what  is  primordial  in  the  ideas  of  ‘bad’  and  ‘good’
conscience, we have also decided as to the distinction between a conscience
which points forward and warns and one which points back and reproves.
The idea of the warning conscience seems, of course, to come closest to the
phenomenon of the summons. It shares with this the character of pointing
forward.  But  this  agreement  is  just  an  illusion.  When  we  experience  a
warning  conscience,  the  voice  is  regarded  in  turn  as  merely  oriented
towards the deed which has been willed, from which it seeks to preserve us.
But  the  warning,  as  a  check  on  what  we  have  willed,  is  possible  only
because the ‘warning’ call is aimed at Dasein’s potentiality-for-Being—that
is,  at  its  understanding  of  itself  in  Being-guilty;  not  until  we  have  such
understanding  does  ‘what  we  have  willed’  get  shattered.  The  conscience
which warns us has the function of regulating from moment to moment our
remaining  free  from  indebtednesses.(1)  In  the  experience  of  a  ‘warning’
conscience the tendency of its call is seen only to the extent that it remains
accessible to the common sense of the “they”.
 

1.  ‘Das  warnende  Gewissen  hat  die  Funktion  der  momentweisen  Regelung  eines  Freibleibens

von Verschuldungen.’ The earlier editions contradict this by writing ‘…hat nicht die Funktion...’

H. 293

 

The third consideration which we have mentioned invokes the fact that
the  everyday  experience  of  the  conscience  has  no  acquaintance  with
anything  like  getting  summoned  to  Being-guilty.  This  must  be  conceded.
But does this everyday experience thus give us any guarantee that the full
possible  content  of  the  call  of  the  voice  of  conscience  has  been  heard
therein?  Does  it  follow  from  this  that  theories  of  conscience  which  are
based  on  the  ordinary  way  of  experiencing  it  have  made  certain  that  their
ontological  horizon  for  analysing  this  phenomenon  is  an  appropriate  one?
Does  not  falling,  which  is  an  essential  kind  of  Being  for  Dasein,  show  us
rather  that  ontically  this  entity  understands  itself  proximally  and  for  the
most  part  in  terms  of  the  horizon  of  concern,  but  that  ontologically,  it
defines  “Being”  in  the  sense  of  presence-at-hand?  This,  however,  leads  to
covering up the phenomenon in two ways: what one sees in this theory is a
sequence of Experiences or ‘psychical processes’—a sequence whose kind
of  Being  is  for  the  most  part  wholly  indefinite.  In  such  experience  the
conscience is encountered as an arbiter and admonisher, with whom Dasein
reckons and pleads its cause.

When Kant represented the conscience as a ‘court of justice’ and made
this  the  basic  guiding  idea  in  his  Interpretation  of  it,  he  did  not  do  so  by
accident;  this  was  suggested  by  the  idea  of  moral  law—although  his
conception  of  morality  was  far  removed  from  utilitarianism  and
eudaemonism. Even the theory of value, whether it is regarded formally or
materially, has as its unexpressed ontological presupposition a ‘metaphysic
of morals’—that is, an ontology of Dasein and existence. Dasein is regarded
as an entity with which one might concern oneself, whether this “concern”
has the sense of ‘actualizing values’ or of satisfying a norm.

If  one  is  to  invoke  the  full  range  of  what  the  everyday  experience  of
conscience—as the only higher court for the Interpretation of conscience—
is  acquainted  with,  this  cannot  be  justified  unless  one  has  considered
the  conscience  can  ever  become  authentically
beforehand  whether 
accessible here at all.

Thus  the  further  objection  that  the  existential  Interpretation  overlooks
the  fact  that  the  call  of  conscience  always  relates  itself  to  some  definite
deed  which  has  been  either  ‘actualized’  or  willed,  also  loses  its  force.  It
cannot  be  denied  that  the  call  is  often  experienced  as  having  such  a
tendency.  It  remains  questionable  only  whether  this  experience  of  the  call
permits it to ‘proclaim’ itself fully. In the common-sense interpretation, one

may  suppose that one is  sticking to  the  ‘facts’; but  in  the  end, by its very
common sense, this interpretation has restricted the call’s disclosive range.
As  little  as  the  ‘good’  conscience  lets  itself  be  put  in  the  service  of  a
‘Pharisaism’,  just  as  little  may  the  function  of  the  ‘bad’  conscience  be
reduced to indicating indebtednesses which are present-at-hand or thrusting
aside  those  which  are  possible.  This  would  be  as  if  Dasein  were  a
‘household’  whose  indebtednesses  simply  need  to  be  balanced  off  in  an
orderly manner so that the Self may stand ‘by’ as a disinterested spectator
while these Experiences run their course.

H. 294

 

If,  however,  that  which  is  primary  in  the  call  is  not  a  relatedness  to  a
guilt  which  is  factically  ‘present-at-hand’,  or  to  some  guilt-charged  deed
which  has  been  factically  willed,  and  if  accordingly  the  ‘reproving’  and
‘warning’ types of conscience express no primordial call-functions, then we
have  also  undermined  the  consideration  we  mentioned  first,  that  the
existential  Interpretation  fails  to  recognize  the  ‘essentially’  critical
character  of  what  the  conscience  does.  This  consideration  too  is  one  that
springs from catching sight of the phenomenon in a manner which, within
certain limits, is genuine; for in the content of the call, one can indeed point
to nothing which the voice ‘positively’ recommends and imposes. But how
are we to understand this positivity which is missing in what the conscience
does? Does it follow from this that conscience has a ‘negative’ character?

We miss a ‘positive’ content in that which is called, because we expect to
be  told  something  currently  useful  about  assured  possibilities  of  ‘taking
action’  which  are  available  and  calculable.  This  expectation  has  its  basis
within  the  horizon  of  that  way  of  interpreting  which  belongs  to  common-
sense concern—a way of interpreting which forces Dasein’s existence to be
subsumed  under  the  idea  of  a  business  procedure  that  can  be  regulated.
Such expectations (and in part these tacitly underlie even the demand for a
material ethic of value as contrasted with one that is ‘merely’ formal) are of
course disappointed by the conscience. The call of conscience fails to give
any  such  ‘practical’  injunctions,  solely  because  it  summons  Dasein  to
existence,  to  its  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being-its-Self.  With  the  maxims
which  one  might  be  led  to  expect—maxims  which  could  be  reckoned  up
unequivocally—the  conscience  would  deny  to  existence  nothing  less  than

the very possibility of taking action. But because the conscience manifestly
cannot be ‘positive’ in this manner, neither does it function ‘just negatively’
in  this  same  manner.  The  call  discloses  nothing  which  could  be  either
positive or negative as something with which we can concern ourselves; for
what  it  has  in  view  is  a  Being  which  is  ontologically  quite  different—
namely, existence. On the other hand, when the call is rightly understood, it
gives  us  that  which  in  the  existential  sense  is  the  ‘most  positive’  of  all—
namely,  the  ownmost  possibility  which  Dasein  can  present  to  itself,  as  a
calling-back  which  calls  it  forth  into  its  factical  potentiality-for-being-its-
Self  at  the  time.  To  hear  the  call  authentically,  signifies  bringing  oneself
into  a  factical  taking-action.  But  only  by  setting  forth  the  existential
structure  implied  in  our  understanding  of  the  appeal  when  we  hear  it
authentically,  shall  we  obtain  a  fully  adequate  Interpretation  of  what  is
called in the call.

We  must  first  show  how  the  only  phenomena  with  which  the  ordinary
interpretation  has  any  familiarity  point  back  to  the  primordial  meaning  of
the  call  of  conscience  when  they  are  understood  in  a  way  that  is
the  ordinary
ontologically  appropriate;  we  must 
interpretation springs from the limitations of the way Dasein interprets itself
in falling; and, since falling belongs to care itself, we must also show that
this interpretation, in spite of all its obviousness, is by no means accidental.

In criticizing the ordinary interpretation of the conscience ontologically,
one  might  be  subject  to  the  misunderstanding  of  supposing  that  if  one
demonstrates  that  the  everyday  way  of  experiencing  the  conscience  is  not
existentially  primordial,  one  will  have  made  some  judgment  as  to  the
existentiell ‘moral quality’ of any Dasein which maintains itself in that kind
of experience. Just as little as existence is necessarily and directly impaired
by  an  ontologically  inadequate  way  of  understanding  the  conscience,  so
little  does  an  existentially  appropriate  Interpretation  of  the  conscience
guarantee that one has understood the call in an existentiell manner. It is no
less  possible  to  be  serious  when  one  experiences  the  conscience  in  the
ordinary way than not to be serious when one’s understanding of it is more
primordial.  Nevertheless,  the  Interpretation  which  is  more  primordial
existentially,  also  discloses  possibilities  for  a  more  primordial  existentiell

understanding,  as  long  as  our  ontological  conceptualization  does  not  let
itself get cut off from our ontical experience.

60.  The  Existential  Structure  of  the  Authentic  Potentiality-for-Being

which is Attested in the Conscience
 

The existential Interpretation of conscience is to exhibit an attestation of
Dasein’s ownmost potentiality-for-Being—an attestation which is [seiende]
in Dasein itself. Conscience attests not by making something known in an
undifferentiated manner, but by calling forth and summoning us to Being-
guilty.  That  which  is  so  attested  becomes  ‘grasped’  in  the  hearing  which
understands  the  call  undisguisedly  in  the  sense  it  has  itself  intended.  The
understanding of the appeal is a mode of Dasein’s Being, and only as such
does  it  give  us  the  phenomenal  content  of  what  the  call  of  conscience
attests.  The  authentic  understanding  of  the  call  has  been  characterized  as
“wanting to have a conscience”. This is a way of letting one’s ownmost Self
take  action  in  itself  of  its  own  accord  in  its  Being-guilty,  and  represents
phenomenally  that  authentic  potentiality-for-Being  which  Dasein  itself
attests. The existential structure of this must now be laid bare. Only so can
we  proceed  to  the  basic  constitution  of  the  authenticity  of  Dasein’s
existence as disclosed in Dasein itself.

Wanting to have a conscience is, as an understanding of oneself in one’s
ownmost potentiality-for-Being, a way in which Dasein has been disclosed.
This disclosedness is constituted by discourse and state-of-mind, as well as
by  understanding.  To  understand  in  an  existentiell  manner  implies
projecting oneself in  each case  upon  one’s ownmost  factical  possibility of
having  the  potentiality-for-Being-in-the-world.  But  the  potentiality-for-
Being is understood only by existing in this possibility.

H. 296

 

What kind  of mood  corresponds to  such understanding? Understanding
the  call  discloses  one’s  own  Dasein 
its
individualization. The uncanniness which is revealed in understanding and
revealed along with it, becomes genuinely disclosed by the state-of-mind of
anxiety  which  belongs  to  that  understanding.  The  fact  of  the  anxiety  of

the  uncannines  of 

in 

conscience,  gives  us  phenomenal  confirmation  that  in  understanding  the
call  Dasein  is  brought  face  to  face  with  its  own  uncanniness.  Wanting-to-
have-a-conscience becomes a readiness for anxiety.

The third essential item in disclosedness is discourse. The call itself is a
primordial  kind  of  discourse  for  Dasein;  but  there  is  no  corresponding
counter-discourse in which, let us say, one talks about what the conscience
has  said,  and  pleads  one’s  cause.  In  hearing  the  call  understandingly,  one
denies oneself any counter-discourse, not because one has been assailed by
some  ‘obscure  power’,  which  suppresses  one’s  hearing,  but  because  this
hearing  has  appropriated  the  content  of  the  call  unconcealedly.  In  the  call
one’s  constant  Being-guilty  is  represented,  and  in  this  way  the  Self  is
brought back from the loud idle talk which goes with the common sense of
the  “they”.  Thus  the  mode  of  Articulative  discourse  which  belongs  to
wanting to have a conscience, is one of reticence. Keeping silent has been
characterized as an essential possibility of discourse.(ix) Anyone who keeps
silent  when  he  wants  to  give  us  to  understand  something,  must  ‘have
something  to  say’.  In  the  appeal  Dasein  gives  itself  to  understand  its
ownmost  potentiality-for-Being.  This  calling  is  therefore  a  keeping-silent.
The discourse of the conscience never comes to utterance. Only in keeping
silent  does  the  conscience  call;  that  is  to  say,  the  call  comes  from  the
soundlessness  of  uncanniness,  and  the  Dasein  which  it  summons  is  called
back  into  the  stillness  of  itself,  and  called  back  as  something  that  is  to
become still. Only in reticence, therefore, is this silent discourse understood
appropriately in wanting to have a conscience. It takes the words away from
the common-sense idle talk of the “they”.

The  common-sense  way  of  interpreting  the  conscience,  which  ‘sticks
rigorously  to  the  facts’,  takes  the  silent  discourse  of  the  conscience  as  an
occasion for passing it off as something which is not at all ascertainable or
present-at-hand. The fact that “they”, who hear and understand nothing but
loud idle talk, cannot ‘report’ any call, is held against the conscience on the
subterfuge  that  it  is  ‘dumb’  and  manifestly  not  present-at-hand.  With  this
kind of interpretation the “they” merely covers up its own failure to hear the
call and the fact that its ‘hearing’ does not reach very far.
 

ix. Cf. Section 34, H. 164.

H. 297

 

 

The  disclosedness  of  Dasein  in  wanting  to  have  a  conscience,  is  thus
constituted by anxiety as state-of-mind, by understanding as a projection of
oneself  upon  one’s  ownmost  Being-guilty,  and  by  discourse  as  reticence.
This  distinctive  and  authentic  disclosedness,  which  is  attested  in  Dasein
itself  by  its  conscience—this  reticent  self-projection  upon  one’s  ownmost
Being-guilty, in which one is ready for anxiety—we call “resoluteness”.

Resoluteness  is  a  distinctive  mode  of  Dasein’s  disclosedness.(1)  In  an
earlier passage, however, we have Interpreted disclosedness existentially as
the primordial truth.(x) Such truth is primarily not a quality of ‘judgment’
nor of any definite way of behaving, but something essentially constitutive
for Being-in-the-world as such. Truth must be conceived as a fundamental
existentiale. In our ontological clarification of the proposition that ‘Dasein
is  in  the  truth’  we  have called  attention  to  the  primordial  disclosedness of
this entity as the truth of existence; and for the delimitation of its character
we have referred to the analysis of Dasein’s authenticity.(xi)

In  resoluteness  we  have  now  arrived  at  that  truth  of  Dasein  which  is
most primordial because it is authentic. Whenever a “there” is disclosed, its
whole Being-in-the-world—that is to say, the world, Being-in, and the Self
which, as an ‘I am’, this entity is—is disclosed with equal primordiality.(2)
 

x. Cf. Section 44, H. 212 ff.
xi. Cf. ibid., H. 221.

1.  The 

etymological 

connection 

between 

‘Entschlossenheit’ 

(‘resoluteness’) 

and

‘Erschlossenheit’ (‘disclosedness’) is not to be overlooked.

2. ‘Die Erschlossenheit des Da erschliesst gleichursprünglich das je ganze In-der-Welt-sein, das
heisst  die  Welt,  das  In-Sein  und  das  Selbst,  das  als  “ich  bin”  dieses  Seiende  ist.’  It  is  not  clear
grammatically  whether  ‘dieses  Seiende’  or  the  pronoun  ‘das’  is  the  subject  of  the  final  clause,  or
whether ‘this entity’ is ‘Dasein’ or ‘Being-in’. The grammatical function of the ‘als “ich bin” ’ is also
doubtful. In support of our interpretation, consult H. 54, 114, 117, 267.

Whenever  the  world  is  disclosed,  entities  within-the-world  have  been
discovered  already.  The  discoveredness  of  the  ready-to-hand  and  the
present-at-hand  is  based  on  the  disclosedness  of  the  world(xii)  for  if  the
current totality of involvements is to be freed, this requires that significance
be understood beforehand. In understanding significance, concernful Dasein
submits itself circumspectively to what it encounters as ready-to-hand. Any
discovering  of  a  totality  of  involvements  goes  back  to  a  “for-the-sake-of-

which”;  and  on  the  understanding  of  such  a  “for-the-sake-of-which”  is
based in turn the understanding of significance as the disclosedness of the
current world. In seeking shelter, sustenance, livelihood, we do so “for the
sake of” constant possibilities of Dasein which are very close to it;(1) upon
these the entity for which its own Being is an issue, has already projected
itself. Thrown into its ‘there’, every Dasein has been factically submitted to
a definite ‘world’—its ‘world’. At the same time those factical projections
which  are  closest  to  it,  have  been  guided  by  its  concernful  lostness in  the
“they”. To this lostness, one’s own Dasein can appeal, and this appeal can
be  understood  in  the  way  of  resoluteness.  But  in  that  case  this  authentic
disclosedness modifies with equal primordiality both the way in which the
‘world’ is discovered (and this is founded upon that disclosedness) and the
way in which the Dasein-with of Others is disclosed. The ‘world’ which is
ready-to-hand  does  not  become  another  one  ‘in  its  content’,  nor  does  the
circle of Others get exchanged for a new one; but both one’s Being towards
the  ready-to-hand  understandingly  and  concernfully,  and  one’s  solicitous
Being  with  Others,  are  now  given  a  definite  character  in  terms  of  their
ownmost potentiality-for-Being-their-Selves.
 

xii. Cf. Section 18, H. 83 ff

H. 298

Resoluteness, as authentic Being-one’s-Self, does not detach Dasein from
its  world,  nor  does  it  isolate  it  so  that  it  becomes  a  free-floating  “I”.  And
how  should 
is
authentically nothing else than Being-in-the-world? Resoluteness brings the
Self right into its current concernful Being-alongside what is ready-to-hand,
and pushes it into solicitous Being with Others.

resoluteness  as  authentic  disclosedness, 

it,  when 

In  the  light  of  the  “for-the-sake-of-which”  of  one’s  self-chosen
potentiality-for-Being,  resolute  Dasein  frees  itself  for  its  world.  Dasein’s
resoluteness towards  itself is  what first  makes it possible  to  let the  Others
who  are  with  it  ‘be’  in  their  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being,  and  to  co-
disclose  this  potentiality  in  the  solicitude  which  leaps  forth  and  liberates.
When Dasein is resolute, it can become the ‘conscience’ of Others. Only by

authentically Being-their-Selves in resoluteness can people authentically be
with one another—not by ambiguous and jealous stipulations and talkative
fraternizing in the “they” and in what “they” want to undertake.

Resoluteness,  by  its  ontological  essence,  is  always  the  resoluteness  of
some factical Dasein at a particular time. The essence of Dasein as an entity
is  its  existence.  Resoluteness  ‘exists’  only  as  a  resolution  [Entschluss]
which  understandingly  projects  itself.  But  on  what  basis  does  Dasein
disclose  itself  in  resoluteness?  On  what  is  it  to  resolve?(1)  Only  the
resolution itself can give the answer. One would completely misunderstand
the  phenomenon  of  resoluteness  if  one  should  want  to  suppose  that  this
consists  simply  in  taking  up  possibilities  which  have  been  proposed  and
recommended,  and  seizing  hold  of  them.  The  resolution  is  precisely  the
disclosive projection and determination of what is factically possible at the
time. To resoluteness, the indefiniteness characteristic of every potentiality-
for-Being  into which Dasein has been factically thrown, is  something that
necessarily belongs. Only in a resolution is resoluteness sure of itself. The
existentiell indefiniteness of resoluteness never makes itself definite except
in a resolution; yet it has, all the same, its existential definiteness.

H. 299

 

in 

What  one 

resolves  upon 

resoluteness  has  been  prescribed
ontologically in the existentiality of Dasein in general as a potentiality-for-
Being in the manner of concernful solicitude. As care, however, Dasein has
been  Determined  by  facticity  and  falling.  Disclosed  in  its  ‘there’,  it
maintains  itself  both  in  truth  and  in  untruth  with  equal  primordiality.(xiii)
This  ‘really’  holds  in  particular  for  resoluteness  as  authentic  truth.
Resoluteness  appropriates  untruth  authentically.  Dasein  is  already  in
irresoluteness 
[Unentschlossenheit],  and  soon,  perhaps,  will  be  in  it  again.  The  term
“irresoluteness’  merely  expresses  that  phenomenon  which  we  have
Interpreted  as  a  Being-surrendered  to  the  way  in  which  things  have  been
prevalently interpreted by the “they”. Dasein, as a they-self, gets ‘lived’ by
the  common-sense  ambiguity  of  that  publicness  in  which  nobody  resolves
upon  anything  but  which  has  always  made  its  decision.(2)  “Resoluteness”
signifies  letting  oneself  be  summoned  out  of  one’s  lostness  in  the  “they”.
The  irresoluteness  of  the  “they”  remains  dominant  notwithstanding,  but  it

inasmuch  as  resoluteness 

cannot impugn resolute existence. In the counter-concept to irresoluteness,
as  resoluteness  as  existentially  understood,  we  do  not  have  in  mind  any
ontico-psychical  characteristic  in  the  sense  of  Being-burdened  with
inhibitions.  Even  resolutions  remain  dependent  upon  the  “they”  and  its
world.  The  understanding  of  this  is  one  of  the  things  that  a  resolution
is  what  first  gives  authentic
discloses, 
transparency to Dasein. In resoluteness the issue for Dasein is its ownmost
potentiality-for-Being,  which, as something thrown, can project  itself only
upon definite factical possibilities. Resolution does not withdraw itself from
‘actuality’, but discovers first what is factically possible; and it does so by
seizing  upon  it  in  whatever  way  is  possible  for  it  as  its  ownmost
potentiality-for-Being  in  the  “they”.  The  existential  attributes  of  any
possible  resolute  Dasein  include  the  items  constitutive  for  an  existential
phenomenon  which  we  call  a  “Situation”  and  which  we  have  hitherto
passed over.
 

xiii. Cf. Section 44b, H. 222.

1.  ‘Aber  woraufhin  erschliesst  sich  das  Dasein  in  der  Entschlossenheit?  Wozu  soll  es  sich
entschliessen?’ (For similar constructions with ‘woraufhin’ etc. and ‘erschliessen’, see H. 141, 143,
145 above.)

2.  ‘Das  Dasein  wird  als  Man-selbst  von  der  verständigen  Zweideutigkeit  der  Öffentlichkeit
“gelebt”,  in  der  sich  niemand  entschliesst,  und  die  doch  schon  immer  beschlossen  hat.’  The
etymological connection between ‘entschliesst’ and ‘beschlossen’ is lost in our translation.

 

 

H. 300

In  the  term  “Situation”  (“situation”—‘to  be  in  a  situation’)  there  is  an
overtone  of  a  signification  that  is  spatial.(1)  We  shall  not  try  to  eliminate
this from the existential conception, for such an overtone is also implied in
the  ‘there’  of  Dasein.  Being-in-the-world  has  a  spatiality  of  its  own,
characterized by the phenomena of de-severance and directionality. Dasein
‘makes room’ in so far as it factically exists.(xiv) But spatiality of the kind
which  belongs  to  Dasein,  and  on  the  basis  of  which  existence  always
determines its ‘location’, is grounded in the state of Being-in-the-world, for
which  disclosedness  is  primarily  constitutive.  Just  as  the  spatiality  of  the
“there”  is  grounded  in  disclosedness,  the  Situation  has  its  foundations  in
resoluteness. The Situation is the “there” which is disclosed in resoluteness
—the  “there”  as  which  the  existent  entity  is  there.  It  is  not  a  framework

removed 

itself.  Far 

present-at-hand  in  which  Dasein  occurs,  or  into  which  it  might  even  just
bring 
from  any  present-at-hand  mixture  of
circumstances and accidents which we encounter, the Situation is only  t h r
o u g h  resoluteness and  i n  i t. The current factical involvement-character
of the circumstances discloses itself to the Self only when that involvement-
character is such that one has resolved upon the “there” as which that Self,
in  existing,  has  to  be.(2)  When  what  we  call  “accidents”  befall  from  the
with-world and the environment, they can be-fall only resoluteness.(3)

For the “they”, however, the Situation is essentially something that has

been closed off.(4)

respectively.

1.  The  German  words  ‘Situation’  and  ‘Lage’  will  be  translated  by  ‘Situation’  and  ‘situation’

2. ‘Entschlossen für das Da, als welches das Selbst existierend zu sein hat, erschliesst sich ihm

erst der jeweilige faktische Bewandtnischarakter der Umstände.’

3.  ‘Nur  der  Ent-schlossenheit  kann  das  aus  der  Mit-  und  Umwelt  zu-fallen,  was  wir  Zufälle
nennen.’  Literally  a  ‘Zufall’  (‘accident’)  is  something  that  ‘falls  to’  something,  or  ‘befalls’  it.
(Compare the Latin ‘accidens’, which has basically the same meaning).

4. ‘verschlossen’. Contrast ‘erschlossen’ (‘disclosed’) and ‘entschlossen’ (‘resolved’).

The  “they”  knows  only  the  ‘general  situation’,  loses  itself  in  those
‘opportunities’  which  are  closest  to  it,  and  pays  Dasein’s  way  by  a
reckoning  up  of  ‘accidents’  which  it  fails  to  recognize,  deems  its  own
achievement, and passes off as such.(1)

Resoluteness  brings  the  Being  of  the  “there”  into  the  existence  of  its
Situation.  Indeed  it  delimits  the  existential  structure  of  that  authentic
potentiality-for-Being  which  the  conscience  attests—wanting  to  have  a
conscience. In this potentiality we have recognized the appropriate way of
understanding the appeal. This makes it entirely plain that when the call of
conscience  summons  us  to  our  potentiality-for-Being,  it  does  not  hold
before  us  some  empty  ideal  of  existence,  but  calls  us  forth  into  the
Situation. This existential positivity which the call of conscience possesses
when rightly understood, gives us at the same time an insight: it makes us
see  to  what  extent  we  fail  to  recognize  the  disclosive  character  of  the
conscience if the tendency of the call is restricted to indebtednesses which
have already occurred or which we have before us; it also makes us see to
what  extent  the  concrete  understanding  of  the  voice  of  conscience  is  only

seemingly  transmitted  to  us  if  this  restriction  is  made.  When  our
understanding of the appeal is Interpreted existentially as resoluteness, the
conscience is revealed as that kind of Being—included in the very basis of
Dasein(2)—in which Dasein makes possible for itself its factical existence,
thus attesting its ownmost potentiality-for-Being.

This phenomenon which we have exhibited as “resoluteness’ can hardly
be  confused  with  an  empty  ‘habitus’  or  an 
indefinite  ‘velleity’.
Resoluteness  does  not  first  take  cognizance  of  a  Situation  and  put  that
Situation  before  itself;  it  has  put  itself  into  that  Situation  already.(3)  As
resolute,  Dasein  is  already  taking action.  The  term  ‘take  action’(4)  is  one
which  we  are  purposely  avoiding.  For  in  the  first  place  this  term  must  be
taken so broadly that “activity” [Aktivität] will also embrace the passivity
of  resistance.  In  the  second  place,  it  suggests  a  misunderstanding  in  the
ontology  of  Dasein,  as  if  resoluteness  were  a  special  way  of  behaviour
belonging to the practical faculty as contrasted with one that is theoretical.
Care,  however,  as  concernful  solicitude,  so  primordially  and  wholly
envelops  Dasein’s  Being  that  it  must  already  be  presupposed  as  a  whole
when we distinguish between theoretical and practical behaviour; it cannot
first  be  built  up  out  of  these  faculties  by  a  dialectic  which,  because  it  is
existentially  ungrounded,  is  necessarily  quite  baseless.  Resoluteness,
however, is only that authenticity which, in care, is the object of care [in der
Sorge  gesorgte],  and  which  is  possible  as  care—the  authenticity  of  care
itself.
 

1.  ‘Es  kennt  nur  die  “allgemeine  Lage”,  verliert  sich  an  die  nächsten  “Gelegenheiten”  und
bestreitet  das  Dasein  aus  der  Verrechnung  der  “Zufälle”,  die  es,  sie  verkennend,  für  die  eigene
Leistung hält und ausgibt.’ We have preserved the grammatical ambiguity of the pronouns ‘die’ and
‘es’.

2.  ‘…als  die  im  Grunde  des  Daseins  beschlossene  Seinsart...’  The  participle  ‘beschlossene’,
which is etymologically akin to ‘erschlossen’, etc., may mean either ‘included’ or ‘decided upon’, as
we have seen on H. 299. Very likely both meanings are here intended.

3. ‘Die Entschlossenheit stellt sich nicht erst, kenntnisnehmend, eine Situation vor, sondern hat
sich schon in sie gestellt.’ Our rather literal translation brings out the contrast between ‘sich stellen
in...’  (‘put  itself  in...’)  and  ‘sich  stellen...  vor...’  (‘put  before  itself...’),  but  fails  to  bring  out  the
important sense of the latter expression: ‘to represent’ or ‘to form an idea of’.

4. ‘ “Handeln” ’. Far from avoiding this term, Heidegger has used it quite frequently. But he is

avoiding it as a possible substitute for the term ‘Entschlossenheit’.

interconnections,  and  to  Interpret  them  according  to  their  existential
structure, falls among the tasks of a thematic existential anthropology.(xv)
For  the  purposes  of  the  present  investigation  as  a  study  of  fundamental
ontology,  it  is  enough  if  that  authentic  potentiality-for-Being  which
conscience  attests  for  Dasein  itself  in  terms  of  Dasein  itself,  is  defined
existentially.

Now  that  resoluteness  has  been  worked  out  as  Being-guilty,  a  self-
projection  in  which  one  is  reticent  and  ready  for  anxiety,(1)  our
investigation has been put in a position for defining the ontological meaning
of  that  potentiality  which  we  have  been  seeking—Dasein’s  authentic
potentiality-for-Being-a-whole. By now the authenticity of Dasein is neither
an empty term nor an idea which someone has fabricated. But even so, as
an  authentic  potentiality-for-Being-a-whole,  the  authentic  Being-towards-
death which we have deduced existentially still remains a purely existential
project  for  which  Dasein’s  attestation  is  missing.  Only  when  such
attestation  has  been  found  will  our  investigation  suffice  to  exhibit  (as  its
authentic  potentiality-for-Being-a-whole,
problematic 
existentially  confirmed  and  clarified—a  potentiality  which  belongs  to
Dasein. For  only  when  this entity  has become phenomenally accessible in
its authenticity and its totality, will the question of the meaning of the Being
of this entity, to whose existence there belongs in general an understanding
of Being, be based upon something which will stand any test.

task of a doctrine of world-views and carried it through. Cf. his Psychologie der Weltanschauungen,

essentially  can  be.  (Cf.  the  foreword  to  the  first  edition.)  The  basic  existential-ontological
signification of ‘limit-situations’ is thus illumined. One would entirely miss the philosophical import
of this ‘psychology of world-views’ if one were to ‘use’ it simply as a reference-work for ‘types of
world-view’.

III: DASEIN’S AUTHENTIC POTENTIALITY-FOR-BEING-A-
WHOLE, AND TEMPORALITY AS THE ONTOLOGICAL
MEANING OF CARE

 

 

61.  A  Preliminary  Sketch  of  the  Methodological  Step  from  the
Definition  of  Dasein’s  Authentic  Being-a-whole  to  the  Laying-bare  of
Temporality as a Phenomenon
 

H. 302

AN  authentic  potentiality-for-Being-a-whole  on  the  part  of  Dasein  has
been  projected  existentially.  By  analysing  this  phenomenon,  we  have
revealed  that  authentic  Being-towards-death  is  anticipation.(i)  Dasein’s
authentic  potentiality-for-Being,  in  its  existentiell  attestation,  has  been
exhibited, and at the same time existentially Interpreted, as resoluteness.(1)
How  are  these  two  phenomena  of  anticipation  and  resoluteness  to  be
brought  together?  Has  not  our  ontological  projection  of  the  authentic
potentiality-for-Being-a-whole led us into a dimension of Dasein which lies
far from the phenomenon of resoluteness? What can death and the ‘concrete
Situation’  of  taking  action  have  in  common?  In  attempting  to  bring
resoluteness and anticipation forcibly together, are we not seduced into an
intolerable  and  quite  unphenomenological  construction,  for  which  we  can
no longer claim that it has the character of an ontological projection, based
upon the phenomena?

Any  superficial  binding  together  of  the  two  phenomena  is  excluded.
There  still  remains  one  way  out,  and  this  is  the  only  possible  method:
namely, to take as our point of departure the phenomenon of resoluteness,
as attested in its existentiell possibility, and to ask: “Does  resoluteness, in
its  ownmost  existentiell  tendency  of  Being,  point  forward  to  anticipatory
resoluteness as its ownmost authentic possibility?” What if resoluteness, in
accordance  with  its  own  meaning,  should  bring  itself  into  its  authenticity
only when it projects itself not upon any random possibilities which just lie

closest,  but  upon  that  uttermost  possibility  which  lies  ahead  of  every
factical  potentiality-for-Being  of  Dasein,(2)  and,  as  such,  enters  more  or
less  undisguisedly  into  every  potentiality-for-Being  of  which  Dasein
factically takes hold?
 

i.  Cf.  Section  58,  H.  280  ff.  [This  reference,  which  appears  in  both  earlier  and  later  editions

seems to be incorrect. Cf. Section53, H. 260 ff.—Tr.]
 

1.  ‘In  seiner  existenziellen  Bezeugung  wurde  das  eigentliche  Seinkönnen  des  Daseins  als
Entschlossenheit aufgezeigt  und  zugleich  existenzial  interpretiert.’  In  the  earlier  editions  the  words
‘aufgezeigt und zugleich existenzial interpretiert’ are inserted between ‘Bezeugung’ and ‘wurde’, not
in their present position.

2. ‘…die allem faktischen Seinkönnen des Daseins vorgelagert ist...’ Cf. note 1, H. 259 above.

What if it is only in the anticipation of [zum] death that resoluteness, as
Dasein’s authentic truth, has reached the authentic certainty which belongs
to  it?  What  if  it  is  only  in  the  anticipation  if  death  that  all  the  factical
‘anticipatoriness’ of resolving would be authentically understood—in other
words, that it would be caught up with in an existentiell way?(1)
 

1. “Wenn im Vorlaufen zum Tode erst alle faktische “Vorläufigkeit” des Entschliessens eigentlich
verstanden,  das  heisst  existenziell  eingeholt wäre?’  Our  translation  of  ‘Vorlaufen’  as  ‘anticipation’
again fails to bring out the metaphor of ‘running ahead’, with which the notion of ‘catching up’ is
here clearly connected. (Cf. our note 3, H. 262 above.) Similarly our translation of ‘Vorläufigkeit’ as
‘anticipatoriness’,  which  brings  out  the  connection  with  ‘vorlaufen’,  is  out  of  line  with  our  usual
translation of the adjective ‘vorläufig’ as ‘provisional’.

H. 303

 

In  our  existential  Interpretation,  the  entity  which  has  been  presented  to
us as our theme has Dasein’s kind of Being, and cannot be pieced together
into something present-at-hand out of pieces which are present-at-hand. So
long  as  we  do  not  forget  this,  every  step  in  our  Interpretation  must  be
guided by the idea of existence. What this signifies for the question of the
possible  connection  between  anticipation  and  resoluteness,  is  nothing  less
than  the  demand  that we  should  project  these existential  phenomena upon
the existentiell possibilities which have been delineated in them, and ‘think
these possibilities through to the end’ in an existential manner. If we do this,
the  working-out  of  anticipatory  resoluteness  as  a  potentiality-for-Being-a-
whole  such  that  this  potentiality  is  authentic  and  is  possible  in  an

existentiell way, will lose the character of an arbitrary construction. It will
have  become  a  way  of  Interpreting  whereby  Dasein  is  liberated  for  its
uttermost possibility of existence.

In  taking  this  step,  the  existential  Interpretation  makes  known  at  the
same  time  its  ownmost  methodological  character.  Up  till  now,  except  for
some remarks which were occasionally necessary, we have deferred explicit
discussions  of  method.  Our  first  task  was  to  ‘go  forth’  towards  the
phenomena. But, before laying bare the meaning of the Being of an entity
which has been revealed in its basic phenomenal content, we must stop for
a while in the course of our investigation, not for the purpose of ‘resting’,
but so that we may be impelled the more keenly.

Any  genuine  method  is  based  on  viewing  in  advance  in  an  appropriate
way the basic constitution of the ‘object’ to be disclosed, or of the domain
within which the object lies. Thus any genuinely methodical consideration
—which is to be distinguished from empty discussions of technique—must
likewise  give  information about  the  kind  of Being  of the  entity which has
been  taken  as  our  theme.  The  clarification  of  the  methodological
possibilities,  requirements,  and  limitations  of  the  existential  analytic  in
general, can alone secure the transparency which is necessary if we are to
take the  basic step of unveiling the  meaning  of the  Being  of care. But  the
Interpretation of the ontological meaning of care must be performed on the
basis  of  envisaging  phenomenologically  in  a  full  and  constant  manner
Dasein’s existential constitution as we have exhibited it up till now.

Ontologically,  Dasein  is  in  principle  different  from  everything  that  is
present-at-hand or Real. Its ‘subsistence’ is not based on the substantiality
of  a  substance  but  on  the  ‘Self-subsistence’  of  the  existing  Self,  whose
Being  has  been  conceived  as  care.(1)  The  phenomenon  of  the  Self—a
phenomenon which is included in care—needs to be defined existentially in
a  way  which  is  primordial  and  authentic,  in  contrast  to  our  preparatory
exhibition  of  the  inauthentic  they-self.  Along  with  this,  we  must  establish
what possible ontological questions are to be directed towards the ‘Self’, if
indeed it is neither substance nor subject.

H. 304

 

In this way, the phenomenon of care will be adequately clarified for the
first  time,  and  we  shall  then  interrogate  it  as  to  its  ontological  meaning.

When  this  meaning  has  been  determined,  temporality  will  have  been  laid
bare. In exhibiting this, we are not led into out-of-the-way and sequestered
domains  of  Dasein;  we  merely  get  a  conception  of  the  entire  phenomenal
content of Dasein’s basic existential constitution in the ultimate foundations
of  its  own  ontological  intelligibility.  Temporality  gets  experienced  in  a
phenomenally  primordial  way  in  Dasein’s  authentic  Being-a-whole,  in  the
phenomenon of anticipatory resoluteness. If temporality makes itself known
primordially  in  this,  then  we  may  suppose  that  the  temporality  of
anticipatory  resoluteness  is  a  distinctive  mode  of  temporality.  Temporality
has different possibilities and different ways of temporalizing itself.(2) The
basic  possibilities  of  existence,  the  authenticity  and  inauthenticity  of
Dasein,  are  grounded  ontologically  on  possible  temporalizations  of
temporality.
 

1.  ‘Sein  “Bestand”  gründet  nicht  in  der  Substanzialität  einer  Substanz,  sondern  in  der

“Selbständigkeit” des existierenden Selbst, dessen Sein als Sorge begriffen wurde.’

In this sentence Heidegger has used no less than five words derived from the Indo-European base
‘stā-’  (Cf.  English  ‘stand’,  Latin  ‘stare’, German  ‘stehen’):  ‘Bestand’,  ‘Substanz’,  ‘Substantialität’,
‘Selbständigkeit’, ‘existierenden’. In each case we have used an English equivalent derived from the
same base.

The  important  word  ‘Bestand’,  which  we  have  here  translated  somewhat  arbitrarily  as
‘subsistence’,  and  have  often  handled  elsewhere  in  other  ways,  corresponds  to  the  verb  ‘bestehen’
(‘to subsist’, ‘to remain’, ‘to consist in’, even ‘to exist’ in a broader sense than Heidegger’s). It thus
may  stand  for  ‘subsistence’  in  the  broadest  sense,  or  more  particularly  for  ‘continued  subsistence’;
and  it  may  also  stand  for  that  of  which  something  ‘consists’—its  ‘content’,  the  whole  ‘stock’  of
things of which it consists. This is the sense in which Heidegger most frequently uses it, especially in
such phrases as ‘der phänomenale Bestand’ (‘the phenomenal content’, ‘the stock of phenomena’).

We  have  also  somewhat  arbitrarily  translated  ‘Selbständigkeit’  as  ‘Self-subsistence’,  in
accordance with our translation of the adjective ‘selbständig’ on H. 291-292. But as we shall see later
(H. 322), ‘Self-constancy’ would perhaps be more appropriate.

2. ‘Zeitlichkeit kann sich in verschiedenen Möglichkeiten und in verschiedener Weise zeitigen.’
In ordinary German the verb ‘zeitigen’ means ‘to bring about’ or more strictly, ‘to bring to maturity’;
this is how we have translated it in the earlier portions of this work. In the present section, however,
and  in  those  which  follow,  Heidegger  is  exploiting  the  etymological  connection  of  ‘zeitigen’  with
such  words  as  ‘Zeit’  (‘time’)  and  ‘Zeitlichkeit’  (‘temporality’);  we  have  accordingly  ventured  to
translate  it  as  ‘to  temporalize.’  We  have  already  called  attention  to  earlier  passages  (H.  122,  178)
where ‘zeitigen’ has been changed to ‘zeigen’ in the later editions. If these changes are not simple
misprints, they may indicate a deliberate intention to avoid the use of this verb in any sense but the
special one here introduced. (Contrast H. 152, where no such correction has been made.)

If  the  ascendancy  of  the  falling  understanding  of  Being  (of  Being  as
presence-at-hand)(1) keeps Dasein far from the ontological character of its
own Being, it keeps it still farther from the primordial foundations of that
Being. So one must not be surprised if, at first glance, temporality does not

correspond  to  that  which  is  accessible  to  the  ordinary  understanding  as
‘time’. Thus neither the way time is conceived in our ordinary experience of
it,  nor  the  problematic  which  arises  from  this  experience,  can  function
the  appropriateness  of  an
without  examination  as  a  criterion  for 
Interpretation of time. Rather, we must, in our investigation, make ourselves
familiar beforehand with the primordial phenomenon of temporality, so that
in  terms  of  this  we  may  cast  light  on  the  necessity,  the  source,  and  the
reason for the dominion of the way it is ordinarily understood.

The  primordial  phenomenon  of  temporality  will  be  held  secure  by
demonstrating  that  if  we  have  regard  for  the  possible  totality,  unity,  and
development  of  those  fundamental  structures  of  Dasein  which  we  have
hitherto  exhibited,  these  structures  are  all  to  be  conceived  as  at  bottom
‘temporal’  and  as  modes  of  the  temporalizing  of  temporality.  Thus,  when
temporality  has  been  laid  bare,  there  arises  for  the  existential  analytic  the
task  of  repeating  our  analysis  of  Dasein  in  the  sense  of  Interpreting  its
essential structures with regard to their temporality. The basic directions of
the analyses thus required are prescribed by temporality itself. Accordingly
the chapter will be divided as follows: anticipatory resoluteness as the way
in  which  Dasein’s  potentiality-for-Being-a-whole  has 
existentiell
authenticity(2) (Section 62); the hermeneutical Situation at which we have
arrived  for  Interpreting  the  meaning  of  the  Being  of  care,  and  the
methodological character of the existential analytic in general (Section 63);
care and Selfhood (Section 64); temporality as the ontological meaning of
care  (Section  65);  Dasein’s  temporality  and  the  tasks  arising  therefrom  of
repeating the existential analysis in a primordial manner (Section 66).

the  Way 

in  which  Dasein’s

Potentiality-for-Being-a-whole has Existentiell Authenticity
 

H. 305

 

When  resoluteness  has  been  ‘thought  through  to  the  end’  in  a  way
corresponding to its ownmost tendency of Being, to what extent does it lead

us  to  authentic  Being-towards-death?  How  are  we  to  conceive  the
connection between wanting to have a conscience and Dasein’s existentially
projected,  authentic  potentiality-for-Being-a-whole?  Does  welding  these
two together yield a new phenomenon? Or are we left with the resoluteness
which  is  attested  in  its  existentiell  possibility,  and  can  this  resoluteness
undergo  an  existentiell  modalization  through  Being-towards-death?  What
does it mean ‘to think through to the end’ existentially the phenomenon of
resoluteness?

We  have  characterized  resoluteness  as  a  way  of  reticently  projecting
oneself upon one’s ownmost Being-guilty, and exacting anxiety of oneself.
Being-guilty  belongs  to  Dasein’s  Being,  and  signifies  the  null  Being-the-
basis  of  a  nullity.  The  ‘Guilty!’  which  belongs  to  the  Being  of  Dasein  is
something  that  can  be  neither  augmented  nor  diminished.  It  comes  before
any quantification, if the latter has any meaning at all. Moreover, Dasein is
essentially  guilty—not  just  guilty  on  some  occasions,  and  on  other
occasions  not.  Wanting-to-have-a-conscience  resolves  upon  this  Being-
guilty. To project oneself upon this Being-guilty, which Dasein is as long as
it is, belongs  to  the  very  meaning  of  resoluteness.  The  existentiell  way  of
taking  over 
therefore  authentically
in  resoluteness, 
accomplished only when that resoluteness, in its disclosure of Dasein, has
become  so  transparent  that  Being-guilty  is  understood  as  something
constant. But this understanding is made possible only in so far as Dasein
discloses  to  itself  its  potentiality-for-Being,  and  discloses  it  ‘right  to  its
end’.  Existentially,  however,  Dasein’s  “Being-at-an-end”  implies  Being-
towards-the-end.  As  Being-towards-the-end  which  understands—that is  to
say,  as  anticipation  of  death—resoluteness  becomes  authentically  what  it
can be. Resoluteness does not just ‘have’ a connection with anticipation, as
with  something  other  than  itself.  It  harbours  in  itself  authentic  Being-
towards-death, as the possible existentiell modality of its own authenticity.
This ‘connection’ must be elucidated phenomenally.

this  ‘guilt’ 

is 

H. 306

 

By  “resoluteness”  we  mean  “letting  oneself  be  called  forth  to  one’s
ownmost Being-guilty”. Being-guilty belongs to the Being of Dasein itself,
and  we  have  determined  that  this  is  primarily  a  potentiality-for-Being.  To
say  that  Dasein  ‘is’  constantly  guilty  can  only  mean  that  in  every  case

Dasein  maintains  itself  in  this  Being  and  does  so  as  either  authentic  or
inauthentic  existing.  Being-guilty  is  not  just  an  abiding  property  of
something  constantly  present-at-hand,  but  the  existentiell  possibility  of
being authentically  or  inauthentically  guilty.  In  every  case,  the  ‘guilty’  is
only  in  the  current  factical  potentiality-for-Being.  Thus  because  Being-
guilty  belongs  to  the  Being  of  Dasein,  it  must  be  conceived  as  a
potentiality-for-Being-guilty.  Resoluteness  projects 
this
potentiality-for-Being—that  is  to  say,  it  understands  itself  in  it.  This
understanding  maintains  itself,  therefore,  in  a  primordial  possibility  of
Dasein.  It  maintains  itself  authentically  in  it  if  the  resoluteness  is
primordially that which it tends to be. But we have revealed that Dasein’s
primordial Being towards its potentiality-for-Being is Being-towards-death
—that  is  to  say,  towards  that  distinctive  possibility  of  Dasein  which  we
have  already  characterized.  Anticipation  discloses  this  possibility  as
possibility.  Thus  only  as  anticipating  does  resoluteness  become  a
primordial  Being  towards  Dasein’s  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being.  Only
when 
itself  as  Being-towards-death  does  resoluteness
understand the ‘can’ of its potentiality-for-Being-guilty.(1)
 

it  ‘qualifies’ 

itself  upon 

1.  ‘Das  “kann”  des  Schuldigseinkönnens  versteht  die  Entschlossenheit  erst,  wenn  sie  sich  als

Sein zum Tode “qualifiziert”.’

When Dasein is  resolute, it takes over authentically  in  its existence the
fact  that  it  is  the  null  basis  of  its  own  nullity.  We  have  conceived  death
existentially  as  what  we  have  characterized  as  the  possibility  of  the
impossibility  of  existence—that  is  to  say,  as  the  utter  nullity  of  Dasein.
Death  is  not  “added  on”  to  Dasein  at  its  ‘end’;  but  Dasein,  as  care,  is  the
thrown  (that  is,  null)  basis  for  its  death.  The  nullity  by  which  Dasein’s
Being is dominated primordially through and through, is revealed to Dasein
itself in authentic Being-towards-death. Only on the basis of Dasein’s whole
Being does anticipation make Being-guilty manifest. Care harbours in itself
both  death  and  guilt  equiprimordially.  Only  in  anticipatory  resoluteness  is
the potentiality-for-Being-guilty understood authentically and wholly—that
is to say, primordially.(ii)
 

ii. The Being-guilty which belongs primordially to Dasein’s state of Being, must be distinguished
from  the  status  corruptionis  as  understood  in  theology.  Theology  can  find  in  Being-guilty,  as
existentially defined, an ontological condition for the factical possibility of such a status. The  guilt
which is included in the idea of this status, is a factical indebtedness of an utterly peculiar kind. It has

its  own  attestation,  which  remains  closed  off  in  principle  from  any  philosophical  experience.  The
existential analysis of Being-guilty, proves nothing either for or against the possibility of sin. Taken
strictly, it cannot even be said that the ontology of Dasein of itself leaves this possibility open; for this
ontology, as a philosophical inquiry, ‘knows’ in principle nothing about sin.

H. 307

 

When  the  call  of  conscience  is  understood,  lostness  in  the  “they”  is
revealed. Resoluteness brings Dasein back to its ownmost potentiality-for-
Being-its-Self.  When  one  has  an  understanding  Being-towards-death—
towards  death  as  one’s  ownmost  possibility—one’s  potentiality-for-Being
becomes authentic and wholly transparent.

The  call  of  conscience  passes  over  in  its  appeal  all  Dasein’s  ‘worldly’
prestige and potentialities. Relentlessly it individualizes Dasein down to its
potentiality-for-Being-guilty,  and  exacts  of  it  that  it  should  be  this
potentiality  authentically.  The  unwavering  precision  with  which  Dasein  is
thus essentially individualized down to its ownmost potentiality-for-Being,
discloses  the  anticipation  of  [zum]  death  as  the  possibility  which  is  non-
relational.  Anticipatory  resoluteness  lets  the  potentiality-for-Being-guilty,
as  one’s  ownmost  non-relational  possibility,  be  struck  wholly  into  the
conscience.

Any  factical  Dasein  has  been  determined  by  its  ownmost  Being-guilty
both before any factical indebtedness has been incurred and after any such
indebtedness has been paid off; and wanting-to-have-a-conscience signifies
that  one  is  ready  for  the  appeal  to  this  ownmost  Being-guilty.  This  prior
Being-guilty,  which 
itself
unconcealedly  in  its  character  as  prior  until  this  very  priority  has  been
enlisted  in  [hineingestellt]  that  possibility  which  is  simply  not  to  be
outstripped. When,  in  anticipation,  resoluteness  has  caught  up  [eingeholt]
the  possibility  of  death  into  its  potentiality-for-Being,  Dasein’s  authentic
existence can no longer be outstripped [überholt] by anything.

is  constantly  with  us,  does  not  show 

H. 308

 

The  phenomenon  of  resoluteness  has  brought  us  before  the  primordial
truth  of  existence.  As  resolute,  Dasein  is  revealed  to  itself  in  its  current
factical  potentiality-for-Being,  and  in  such  a  way  that  Dasein  itself  is this
revealing and Being-revealed. To any truth, there belongs a corresponding

holding-for-true.  The  explicit  appropriating  of  what  has  been  disclosed  or
discovered is Being-certain. The primordial  truth  of existence demands an
equiprimordial  Being-certain,  in  which  one  maintains  oneself  in  what
resoluteness  discloses.  It(1)  gives  itself  the  current  factical  Situation,  and
brings  itself  into  that  Situation.  The  Situation  cannot  be  calculated  in
advance  or  presented  like  something  present-at-hand  which  is  waiting  for
someone to grasp it. It merely gets disclosed in a free resolving which has
not  been  determined  beforehand  but  is  open  to  the  possibility  of  such
determination.  What,  then,  does  the  certainty  which  belongs  to  such
resoluteness  signify?  Such  certainty  must  maintain  itself  in  what  is
disclosed  by  the  resolution.  But  this  means  that  it  simply  cannot  become
rigid as  regards  the  Situation,  but  must  understand  that  the  resolution,  in
accordance  with  its  own  meaning  as  a  disclosure,  must  be  held open  and
free  for  the  current  factical  possibility.  The  certainty  of  the  resolution
signifies that one holds oneself free for the possibility of taking it back—a
possibility which is factically necessary.(2) However, such holding-for-true
in resoluteness (as the truth of existence) by no means lets us fall back into
irresoluteness. On the contrary, this holding-for-true, as a resolute holding-
oneself-free  for  taking  back,  is  authentic  resoluteness  which  resolves  to
keep repeating itself.(3) Thus, in an existentiell manner, one’s very lostness
in  irresoluteness  gets  undermined.  The  holding-for-true  which  belongs  to
resoluteness,  tends,  in  accordance  with  its  meaning,  to  hold  itself  free
constantly—that is,  to  hold  itself  free  for  Dasein’s  whole  potentiality-for-
Being. This constant certainty is guaranteed to resoluteness only so that it
will relate itself to that possibility of which it can be utterly certain.  In its
death,  Dasein  must  simply  ‘take  back’  everything.  Since  resoluteness  is
constantly  certain  of  death—in  other  words,  since  it  anticipates  it—
resoluteness thus attains a certainty which is authentic and whole.
 

1. Heidegger’s ambiguous pronoun refers to ‘resoluteness’, as is clear from H. 326 below.
2. ‘Die Gewissheit des Entschlusses bedeutet: Sichfreihalten für seine  mögliche und je faktisch
notwendige  Zurücknahme.’  It  is  not  grammatically  clear  whether  the  possessive  adjective  ‘seine’
refers back to ‘Entschlusses’ (‘resolution’) or to the ‘Sich-’ of ‘Sichfreihalten’ (‘oneself’).  We  have
chosen the former interpretation as somewhat more natural. But it is tempting to construe this and the
following sentence as preparing the way for Heidegger s remark a few lines below that ‘In seinem
Tod muss sich das Dasein schlechthin “zurücknehmen” ’—which might be translated as ‘In its death,
Dasein  must  ‘withdraw’  itself  utterly.’  In  that  case  it  would  be  attractive  to  translate  the  present
sentence by writing ‘…holds oneself free for one’s own withdrawal…’

3.  ‘…eigentliche  Entschlossenheit  zur  Wiederholung  ihrer  selbst.’  The  idea  seems  to  be  that
authentic resoluteness keeps reiterating itself in the face of a constant awareness that it may have to

be retracted or taken back at any time.

But Dasein is equiprimordially in the untruth. Anticipatory resoluteness
gives  Dasein  at  the  same  time  the  primordial  certainty  that  it  has  been
closed  off.  In  anticipatory  resoluteness,  Dasein  holds  itself  open  for  its
constant  lostness  in  the  irresoluteness  of  the  “they”—a  lostness  which  is
possible from the very basis of its own Being. As a constant possibility of
Dasein,  irresoluteness  is  co-certain.  When  resoluteness  is  transparent  to
itself, it understands that the indefiniteness of one’s potentiality-for-Being is
made definite only in a resolution as regards the current Situation. It knows
about the indefiniteness by which an entity that exists is dominated through
and through. But if this knowing is to correspond to authentic resoluteness,
it must itself arise from an authentic disclosure. The indefiniteness of one’s
own potentiality-for-Being, even when this potentiality has become certain
in  a  resolution,  is  first  made  wholly  manifest  in  Being-towards-death.
Anticipation  brings  Dasein  face  to  face  with  a  possibility  which  is
constantly certain but which at any moment remains indefinite as to when
that possibility will become an impossibility. Anticipation makes it manifest
that  this  entity  has  been  thrown  into  the  indefiniteness  of  its  ‘limit-
Situation’;  when  resolved  upon  the  latter,  Dasein  gains  its  authentic
potentiality-for-Being-a-whole.  The  indefiniteness  of  death  is  primordially
disclosed 
to  exact
resoluteness  of  itself.  It  moves  out  of  the  way  everything  which  conceals
the fact that Dasein has been abandoned to itself. The “nothing” with which
anxiety  brings  us  face  to  face,  unveils  the  nullity  by  which  Dasein,  in  its
very basis, is defined; and this basis itself  i s  as thrownness into death.

this  primordial  anxiety  strives 

in  anxiety.  But 

H. 309

 

Our  analysis  has  revealed seriatim those items  of  modalization towards
which  resoluteness  tends  of  itself  and  which  arise  from  authentic  Being
towards  death  as  that  possibility  which  is  one’s  ownmost,  non-relational,
not  to  be  outstripped,  certain,  and  yet  indefinite.  Resoluteness  is
authentically and wholly what it can be, only as anticipatory resoluteness.

But on the other hand, in our Interpretation of the ‘connection’ between
resoluteness  and  anticipation,  we  have  first  reached  a  full  existential
understanding of anticipation itself. Hitherto this could amount to no more

than an ontological projection. We have now shown that anticipation is not
just a fictitious possibility which we have forced upon Dasein; it is a mode
of  an  existentiell  potentiality-for-Being  that  is  attested  in  Dasein—a  mode
which Dasein exacts of itself, if indeed it authentically understands itself as
resolute.  Anticipation  ‘is’  not  some  kind  of  free-floating  behaviour,  but
must be conceived as the possibility of the authenticity of that resoluteness
which has been attested in an existentiell way—a possibility hidden in such
resoluteness, and thus attested therewith. Authentic  ‘thinking  about  death’
is a wanting-to-have-a-conscience, which has become transparent to itself in
an existentiell manner. If resoluteness, as authentic, tends towards the mode
delimited  by  anticipation,  and  if  anticipation  goes  to  make  up  Dasein’s
authentic  potentiality-for-Being-a-whole,  then  in  the  resoluteness  which  is
attested  in  an  existentiell  manner,  there  is  attested  with  it  an  authentic
potentiality-for-Being-a-whole  which  belongs  to  Dasein.  The  question  of
the  potentiality-for-Being-a-whole  is  one  which  is  factical  and  existentiell.
It is answered by Dasein as resolute. The question of Dasein’s potentiality-
for-Being-a-whole has now fully sloughed off the character indicated at the
beginning,(iii)  when  we  treated  it  as  it  if  were  just  a  theoretical  or
methodological  question  of  the  analytic  of  Dasein,  arising  from  the
endeavour to have the whole of Dasein completely ‘given’. The question of
Dasein’s totality, which at the beginning we discussed only with regard to
ontological  method,  has  its  justification,  but  only  because  the  ground  for
that justification goes back to an ontical possibility of Dasein.

By  thus  casting  light  upon  the  ‘connection’  between  anticipation  and
resoluteness  in  the  sense  of  the  possible  modalization  of  the  latter  by  the
former,  we  have  exhibited  as  a  phenomenon  an  authentic  potentiality-for-
Being-a-whole which belongs to Dasein. If with this phenomenon we have
reached a way of Being of Dasein in which it brings itself to itself and face
to  face  with  itself,  then  this  phenomenon  must,  both  ontically  and
ontologically, remain unintelligible to the everyday common-sense manner
in which Dasein has been interpreted by the “they”. It would be 
a misunderstanding to shove this existentiell possibility aside as ‘unproved’
or  to  want  to  ‘prove’  it  theoretically.  Yet  the  phenomenon  needs  to  be
protected against the grossest perversions.

Anticipatory  resoluteness  is  not  a  way  of  escape,  fabricated  for  the
‘overcoming’ of death; it is rather that understanding which follows the call
of conscience and which frees for death the possibility of acquiring power
over  Dasein’s  existence  and  of  basically  dispersing  all  fugitive  Self-
concealments.  Nor  does  wanting-to-have-a-conscience,  which  has  been
made  determinate  as  Being-towards-death,  signify  a  kind  of  seclusion  in
which  one  flees  the  world;  rather,  it  brings  one  without  Illusions  into  the
resoluteness of ‘taking action’. Neither does anticipatory resoluteness stem
from  ‘idealistic’  exactions  soaring  above  existence  and  its  possibilities;  it
springs  from  a  sober  understanding  of  what  are  factically  the  basic
possibilities for Dasein. Along with the sober anxiety which brings us face
to  face  with  our  individualized  potentiality-for-Being,  there  goes  an
unshakable  joy  in  this  possibility.  In  it  Dasein  becomes  free  from  the
entertaining ‘incidentals’ with which busy curiosity keeps providing itself—
primarily  from  the  events  of  the  world.(1)  But  the  analysis  of  these  basic
moods  would  transgress  the  limits  which  we  have  drawn  for  the  present
Interpretation by aiming towards fundamental ontology.
 

1.  ‘In  ihr  wird  das  Dasein  frei  von  den  “Zufälligkeiten”  des  Unterhaltenwerdens  die  sich  die

geschäftige Neugier primär aus den Weltbegebenheiten verschafft.’

Is  there  not,  however,  a  definite  ontical  way  of  taking  authentic
existence,  a  factical 
ideal  of  Dasein,  underlying  our  ontological
Interpretation of Dasein’s existence? That is so indeed. But not only is this
Fact  one  which  must  not  be  denied  and  which  we  are  forced  to  grant;  it
must also be conceived in its positive necessity, in terms of the object which
we have taken as the theme of our investigation. Philosophy will never seek
to  deny  its  ‘presuppositions’,  but  neither  may  it  simply  admit  them.  It
conceives  them,  and  it  unfolds  with  more  and  more  penetration  both  the
presuppositions themselves and that for which they are presuppositions. The
methodological  considerations  now  demanded  of  us  will  have  this  very
function.

63.  The  Hermeneutical  Situation  at  which  we  have  Arrived  for
Interpreting the  Meaning  of the  Being of Care; and  the  Methodological
Character of the Existential Analytic in General
 

‘Die für eine Interpretation des Seinssinnes der Sorge gewonnene hermeneutische Situation und

der methodische Charakter der existenzialen Analytik überhaupt.’

 

 

H. 311

In 

its  anticipatory 

resoluteness,  Dasein  has  now  been  made
phenomenally  visible  with  regard  to  its  possible  authenticity  and  totality.
The  hermeneutical  Situation(iv)  which  was  previously  inadequate  for
interpreting  the  meaning  of  the  Being  of  care,  now  has  the  required
primordiality. Dasein has been put into that which we have in advance, and
this  has  been  done  primordially—that  is  to  say,  this  has  been  done  with
regard to its authentic potentiality-for-Being-a-whole; the idea of existence,
which guides us as that which we see in advance, has been made definite by
the  clarification  of  our  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being;  and,  now  that  we
have  concretely  worked  out  the  structure  of  Dasein’s  Being,  its  peculiar
ontological  character  has  become  so  plain  as  compared  with  everything
present-at-hand,  that  Dasein’s  existentiality  has  been  grasped  in  advance
with  sufficient  Articulation  to  give  sure  guidance  for  working  out  the
existentialia conceptually.

The way which we have so far pursued in the analytic of Dasein has led
us to a concrete demonstration of the thesis(v) which was put forward just
casually at the beginning—that the entity which in every case we ourselves
are, is ontologically that which is farthest. The  reason  for  this  lies  in  care
itself.  Our  Being  alongside  the  things  with  which  we  concern  ourselves
most closely in the ‘world’—a Being which is falling—guides the everyday
way  in  which  Dasein  is  interpreted,  and  covers  up  ontically  Dasein’s
authentic Being, so that the ontology which is directed towards this entity is
denied  an  appropriate  basis.  Therefore  the  primordial  way  in  which  this
entity  is  presented  as  a  phenomenon  is  anything  but  obvious,  if  even
ontology  proximally  follows  the  course  of  the  everyday  interpretation  of
Dasein.  The  laying-bare  of  Dasein’s  primordial  Being  must  rather  be

wrested from  Dasein  by  following  the  opposite  course from  that  taken  by
the falling ontico-ontological tendency of interpretation.

Not  only  in  exhibiting  the  most  elemental  structures  of  Being-in-the-
world,  in  delimiting  the  concept  of  the  world,  in  clarifying  the  average
“who”  of  this  entity  (the  “who”  which  is  closest  to  us—the  they-self),  in
Interpreting  the  ‘there’,  but  also,  above  all,  in  analysing  care,  death,
conscience,  and  guilt—in  all  these  ways  we  have  shown  how  in  Dasein
itself concernful common sense has taken control of Dasein’s potentiality-
for-Being and the disclosure of that potentiality—that is to say, the closing
of it off.
 

iv. Cf. Section 45, H. 232.
v. Cf. Section 5, H. 15

H. 312

 

Dasein’s kind of Being thus demands that  any  ontological  Interpretation
which sets itself the goal of exhibiting the phenomena in their primordiality,
should capture the Being of this entity, in spite of this entity’s own tendency
to  cover  things  up.  Existential  analysis,  therefore,  constantly  has  the
character  of doing  violence  [Gewaltsamkeit], whether  to  the  claims  of  the
everyday  interpretation,  or  to  its  complacency  and  its  tranquillized
obviousness. While indeed this characteristic is specially distinctive of the
ontology  of  Dasein,  it  belongs  properly  to  any  Interpretation,  because  the
understanding  which  develops  in  Interpretation  has  the  structure  of  a
projection. But is not anything of this sort guided and regulated in a way of
its  own?  Where  are  ontological  projects  to  get  the  evidence  that  their
‘findings’  are  phenomenally  appropriate?  Ontological  Interpretation
projects the entity presented to it upon the Being which is that entity’s own,
so as to conceptualize it with regard to its structure. Where are the signposts
to direct the projection, so that Being will be reached at all? And what it the
entity which becomes the theme of the existential analytic, hides the Being
that  belongs  to  it,  and  does  so  in its  very  way  of  being?  To  answer  these
questions  we  must  first  restrict  ourselves  to  clarifying  the  analytic  of
Dasein, as the questions themselves demand.

The  interpretation  of  the  Self  belongs  to  Dasein’s  Being.  In  the
circumspective-concernful discovering of the ‘world’, concern gets sighted

too.  Dasein  always  understands  itself  factically  in  definite  existentiell
possibilities,  even  if  its  projects  stem  only  from  the  common  sense  of  the
“they”. Whether explicitly or not, whether appropriately or not, existence is
somehow  understood  too.  There  are  some  things  which  every  ontical
understanding ‘includes’, even if these are only pre-ontological—that  is  to
say, not conceived theoretically or thematically. Every ontologically explicit
question  about  Dasein’s  Being  has  had  the  way  already  prepared  for  it  by
the kind of Being which Dasein has.

those  existentiell  possibilities  with  which 

Yet where are we to find out what makes up the ‘authentic’ existence of
Dasein?  Unless  we  have  an  existentiell  understanding,  all  analysis  of
existentiality will remain groundless. Is it not the case that underlying our
Interpretation  of  the  authenticity  and  totality  of  Dasein,  there  is  an  ontical
way of taking existence which may be possible but need not be binding for
everyone?  Existential  Interpretation  will  never  seek  to  take  over  any
authoritarian pronouncement as to those things which, from an existentiell
point of view, are possible or binding. But must it not justify itself in regard
to 
it  gives  ontological
Interpretation  its  ontical  basis?  If  the  Being  of  Dasein  is  essentially
potentiality-for-Being,  if  it  is  Being-free  for  its  ownmost  possibilities,  and
if, in every case, it exists only in freedom for these possibilities or in lack of
freedom for them, can ontological Interpretation do anything else than base
itself  on ontical  possibilities—ways of  potentiality-for-Being—and  project
these  possibilities  upon  their  ontological  possibility? And  if,  for  the  most
part, Dasein interprets itself in terms of its lostness in concerning itself with
the ‘world’, does not the appropriate way of disclosure for such an entity lie
in  determining  the  ontico-existentiell  possibilities  (and  doing  so  in  the
manner which we have achieved by following the opposite course) and then
providing an existential analysis grounded upon these possibilities? In  that
case,  will  not  the  violence  of  this  projection  amount  to  freeing  Dasein’s
undisguised phenomenal content?

H. 313

 

It  may  be  that  our  method  demands  this  ‘violent’  presentation  of
possibilities  of  existence,  but  can  such  a  presentation  be  taken  out  of  the
province  of  our  free  discretion?  If  the  analytic  makes  anticipatory
resoluteness  basic  as  a  potentiality-for-Being  which,  in  an  existentiell

manner, is authentic—a possibility to which Dasein itself summons us from
the very basis of its existence—then is this possibility just one which is left
to  our  discretion?  Has  that  way-of-Being  in  accordance  with  which
Dasein’s  potentiality-for-Being  comports  itself  towards  its  distinctive
possibility—death—been  just  accidentally  pounced  upon?  Does  Being-in-
the-world have a higher instance for its potentiality-for-Being than its own
death?(1)

Even  if  the  ontico-ontological  projection  of  Dasein  upon  an  authentic
potentiality-for-Being-a-whole may not be just something that is left to our
discretion,  does  this  already  justify  the  existential  Interpretation  we  have
given  for  this  phenomenon?  Where  does  this  Interpretation  get  its  clue,  if
not  from  an  idea  of  existence  in  general  which  has  been  ‘presupposed’?
How  have  the  steps  in  the  analysis  of  inauthentic  everydayness  been
regulated, if not by the concept of existence which we have posited? And if
we  say  that  Dasein  ‘falls’,  and  that  therefore  the  authenticity  of  its
potentiality-for-Being must be wrested from Dasein in spite of this tendency
of  its  Being,(2)  from  what  point  of  view  is  this  spoken?  Is  not  everything
already illumined by the light of the ‘presupposed’ idea of existence, even if
rather  dimly?  Where  does  this  idea  get  its  justification?  Has  our  initial
projection, in which we called attention to it, led us nowhere? By no means.
 

1. ‘Hat das In-der-Welt-sein eine höhere Instanz seines Seinkönnens als seinen Tod?’
2.  ‘…und  deshalb  sei  ihm  die  Eigentlichkeit  des  Seinkönnens  gegen  diese  Seinstendenz
abzuringen...’ This of course does not mean that this authenticity is to be taken away from Dasein; it
means that because such authenticity runs counter to Dasein’s tendency to fall, Dasein must make a
very real effort to achieve it, or perhaps rather that our Interpretation calls for a similar effort if this
authenticity is to be properly discerned.

In  indicating  the  formal  aspects  of  the  idea  of  existence  we  have  been
guided  by  the  understanding-of-Being  which  lies  in  Dasein  itself.  Without
any ontological transparency, it has nevertheless been revealed that in every
case  I  am  myself  the  entity  which  we  call  Dasein,  and  that  I  am  so  as  a
potentiality-for-Being  for  which  to  be  this  entity  is  an  issue.  Dasein
understands itself as Being-in-the-world, even if it does so without adequate
ontological  definiteness.  Being  thus,  it  encounters  entities  which  have  the
kind of Being of what is ready-to-hand and present-at-hand. No matter how
far removed from an ontological concept the distinction between existence
and  Reality  may  be,  no  matter  even  if  Dasein  proximally  understands
existence  as  Reality,  Dasein  is  not  just  present-at-hand  but  has  already

understood  itself, however  mythical  or  magical  the  interpretation  which  it
gives  may  be.  For  otherwise,  Dasein  would  never  ‘live’  in  a  myth  and
would not be concerned with magic in ritual and cult. The idea of existence
which  we  have  posited  gives  us  an  outline  of  the  formal  structure  of  the
understanding of Dasein and does so in a way which is not binding from an
existentiell point of view.

H. 314

 

Under  the  guidance  of  this  idea  the  preparatory  analysis  of  the
everydayness  that  lies  closest  to  us  has  been  carried  out  as  far  as  the  first
conceptual definition  of  “care”.  This  latter  phenomenon  has  enabled  us  to
get  a  more  precise  grasp  of  existence  and  of  its  relations  to  facticity  and
falling. And defining the structure of care has given us a basis on which to
distinguish  ontologically  between  existence  and  Reality  for  the  first  time.
(vi) This has led us to the thesis that the substance of man is existence.(vii)

Yet even in this formal idea of existence, which is not binding upon us in
an  existentiell  way,  there  already  lurks  a  definite  though  unpretentious
ontological  ‘content’,  which—like  the  idea  of  Reality,  which  has  been
distinguished  from  this—‘presupposes’  an  idea  of  Being  in  general.  Only
within  the  horizon  of  this  idea  of  Being  can  the  distinction  between
existence  and  Reality  be  accomplished.  Surely,  in  both  of  them  what  we
have in view is Being.

But  if  we  are  to  obtain  an  ontologically  clarified  idea  of  Being  in
general, must we not do so by first working out that understanding-of-Being
which  belongs  to  Dasein?  This  understanding,  however,  is  to  be  grasped
primordially  only  on  the  basis  of  a  primordial  Interpretation  of  Dasein,  in
which  we  take  the  idea  of  existence  as  our  clue.  Does  it  not  then  become
altogether  patent  in  the  end  that  this  problem  of  fundamental  ontology
which we have broached, is one which moves in a ‘circle’?

We  have 

in  analysing 

indeed  already  shown, 

the  structure  of
understanding  in  general,  that  what  gets  censured  inappropriately  as  a
‘circle’,  belongs  to  the  essence  and  to  the  distinctive  character  of
understanding  as  such.(viii)  In  spite  of  this,  if  the  problematic  of
fundamental  ontology  is  to  have  its  hermeneutical  Situation  clarified,  our
investigation  must  now  come  back  explicitly  to  this  ‘circular  argument’.
When it is objected that the existential Interpretation is ‘circular’, it is said
that  we  have  ‘presupposed’  the  idea  of  existence  and  of  Being  in  general,
and  that  Dasein  gets  Interpreted  ‘accordingly’,  so  that  the  idea  of  Being
may  be  obtained  from  it.  But  what  does  ‘presupposition’  signify?  In
positing  the  idea  of  existence,  do  we  also  posit  some  proposition  from
which  we  deduce  further  propositions  about  the  Being  of  Dasein,  in
accordance  with  formal  rules  of  consistency?  Or  does  this  pre-supposing
have the character of an understanding projection, in such a manner indeed
that the Interpretation by which such an understanding gets developed, will
let that which is to be interpreted put itself into words for the very first time,
so that it may decide of its own accord whether, as the entity which it is, it
has that state of Being for which it has been disclosed in the projection with
regard  to  its  formal  aspects?(1) Is  there  any  other  way  at  all  by  which  an
entity  can  put  itself  into  words  with  regard  to  its  Being?  We  cannot  ever
‘avoid’  a  ‘circular’  proof  in  the  existential  analytic,  because  such  an
analytic  does  not  do  any  proving  at  all  by  the  rules  of  the  ‘logic  of
consistency’.  What  common  sense  wishes  to  eliminate  in  avoiding  the
‘circle’,  on  the  supposition  that  it  is  measuring  up  to  the  loftiest  rigour  of
scientific  investigation,  is  nothing  less  than  the  basic  structure  of  care.
Because it is primordially constituted by care, any Dasein is already ahead
of itself. As being, it has in every case already projected itself upon definite
possibilities of its existence; and in such existentiell projections it has, in a
pre-ontological manner, also projected something like existence and Being.
Like  all  research, the  research  which  wants  to  develop  and  conceptualize
that  kind  of  Being  which  belongs  to  existence,  is  itself  a  kind  of  Being
which  disclosive  Dasein  possesses;  can  such  research  be  denied  this
projecting which is essential to Dasein?
 

viii. Cf. Section 32, H. 152 ff.

 

1. ‘Oder hat dieses Voraus-setzen den Charakter des verstehenden Entwerfens, so zwar, dass die
solches Verstehen ausbildende Interpretation das Auszulegende gerade erst selbst zu Wort kommen

lässt,  damit  es  von  sich  aus  entscheide,  ob  es  als  dieses  Seiende  die  Seinsverfassung  hergibt,  auf
welche es im Entwurf formalanzeigend erschlossen wurde?’ Here, however, Heidegger may be using
the verb ‘erschliessen’ in the sense of ‘infer’, in spite of his remarks on H. 75 above (see our note 1
ad loc.) and ‘Entwurf’ in the sense of ‘sketch’.

Yet the ‘charge of circularity’ itself comes from a kind of Being which
belongs  to  Dasein.  Something  like  a  projection,  even  an  ontological  one,
still  remains  for  the  common  sense  of  our  concernful  absorption  in  the
“they”;  but  it  necessarily  seems  strange  to  us,  because  common  sense
barricades  itself  against  it  ‘on  principle’.  Common  sense  concerns  itself,
whether  ‘theoretically’  or  ‘practically’,  only  with  entities  which  can  be
surveyed at a glance circumspectively. What is distinctive in common sense
is that it has in view only the experiencing of ‘factual’ entities, in order that
it may be able to rid itself of an understanding of Being. It fails to recognize
that  entities  can  be  experienced  ‘factually’  only  when  Being  is  already
understood,  even  if  it  has  not  been  conceptualized.  Common  sense
misunderstands  understanding.  And 
therefore  common  sense  must
necessarily  pass  off  as  ‘violent’  anything  that  lies  beyond  the  reach  of  its
understanding, or any attempt to go out so far.

H. 316

 

When one talks of the ‘circle’ in understanding, one expresses a failure
to  recognize  two  things:  (1) that  understanding  as  such  makes  up  a  basic
kind  of  Dasein’s  Being,  and  (2) that  this  Being  is  constituted  as  care.  To
deny the circle, to make a secret of it, or even to want to overcome it, means
finally  to  reinforce  this  failure.  We  must  rather  endeavour  to  leap  into  the
‘circle’, primordially and wholly, so that even at the start of the analysis of
Dasein we make sure that we have a full view of Dasein’s circular Being. If,
in the ontology of Dasein, we ‘take our departure’ from a worldless “I” in
order  to  provide  this  “I”  with  an  Object  and  an  ontologically  baseless
relation  to  that  Object,  then  we  have  ‘presupposed’  not  too  much,  but  too
little. If we make a problem of ‘life’, and then just occasionally have regard
for death too, our view is too short-sighted. The object we have taken as our
theme is artificially and dogmatically curtailed if ‘in the first instance’ we
restrict ourselves to a ‘theoretical subject’, in order that we may then round
it out ‘on the practical side’ by tacking on an ‘ethic’.

This may suffice to clarify the existential meaning of the hermeneutical
Situation  of  a  primordial  analytic  of  Dasein.  By  exhibiting  anticipatory
resoluteness, we have brought Dasein before us with regard to its authentic
totality,  so  that  we  now  have  it  in  advance.  The  authenticity  of  the
potentiality-for-Being-one’s-Self guarantees that primordial existentiality is
something  we  see  in  advance,  and  this  assures  us  that  we  are  coining  the
appropriate existential concepts.(1)

At the same time our analysis of anticipatory resoluteness has led us to
the phenomenon of primordial and authentic truth. We have shown earlier
how  that  understanding-of-Being  which  prevails  proximally  and  for  the
most part, conceives Being in the sense of presence-at-hand, and so covers
up  the  primordial  phenomenon  of  truth.(ix)  If,  however,  ‘there  is’  Being
only  in  so  far  as  truth  ‘is’,  and  if  the  understanding  of  Being  varies
according to the kind of truth, then truth which is primordial and authentic
must  guarantee  the  understanding  of  the  Being  of  Dasein  and  of  Being  in
general.  The  ontological  ‘truth’  of  the  existential  analysis  is  developed  on
the ground of the primordial existentiell truth. However, the latter does not
necessarily need the former. The most primordial and basic existential truth,
for which the problematic of fundamental ontology strives in preparing for
the question of Being in general, is the disclosedness of the meaning of the
Being  of  care.  In  order  to  lay  bare  this  meaning,  we  need  to  hold  in
readiness, undiminished, the full structural content of care.

64. Care and Selfhood

 

 

H. 317

Through  the  unity  of  the  items  which  are  constitutive  for  care—
existentiality,  facticity,  and  fallenness—it  has  become  possible  to  give  the
first ontological definition for the totality of Dasein’s structural whole. We
have  given  an  existential  formula  for  the  structure  of  care  as  “ahead-of-
itself—Being-already-in (a world) as Being-alongside (entities encountered
within-the-world)”.(2)  We  have  seen  that  the  care-structure  does  not  first
arise  from  a  coupling  together,  but  is  articulated  all  the  same.(x)  In

assessing  this  ontological  result,  we  have  had  to  estimate  how  well  it
satisfies the requirements for a primordial Interpretation of Dasein.(xi) The
upshot of these considerations has been that neither the whole of Dasein nor
its  authentic  potentiality-for-Being  has  ever  been  made  a  theme.  The
structure of care, however, seems to be precisely where the attempt to grasp
the whole of Dasein as a phenomenon has foundered. The “ahead-of-itself”
presented  itself  as  a  “not-yet”.  But  when  the  “ahead-of-itself”  which  had
been  characterized  as  something  still  outstanding,  was  considered  in
genuinely existential manner, it revealed itself as Being-towards-the-end—
something  which,  in  the  depths  of  its  Being,  every  Dasein  is.  We  made  it
plain at the same time that in the call of conscience care summons Dasein
towards  its  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being.  When  we  came  to  understand
in  a  primordial  manner  how  this  appeal  is  understood,  we  saw  that  the
understanding  of  it  manifests  itself  as  anticipatory  resoluteness,  which
includes  an  authentic  potentiality-for-Being-a-whole—a  potentiality  of
Dasein.  Thus  the  care-structure  does  not  speak  against  the  possibility  of
Being-a-whole but is the condition for the possibility of such an existentiell
potentiality-for-Being. In the course of these analyses, it became plain that
the  existential  phenomena  of  death,  conscience,  and  guilt  are  anchored  in
the  phenomenon  of  care.  The  totality  of  the  structural  whole  has  become
even more richly articulated; and because of this, the existential question of
the unity of this totality has become still more urgent.

How are we to conceive this unity? How can Dasein exist as a unity in
the  ways  and  possibilities  of  its  Being  which  we  have  mentioned?
Manifestly, it can so exist only in such a way that it is itself this Being in its

essential  possibilities—that  in  each  case I am  this  entity.  The  ‘I’  seems  to
‘hold together’ the totality of the structural whole. In the ‘ontology’ of this
entity, the ‘I’ and the ‘Self’ have been conceived from the earliest times as
the  supporting  ground  (as  substance  or  subject).  Even  in  its  preparatory
characterization of everydayness, our analytic has already come up against
the question of Dasein’s “who”. It has been shown that proximally and for
the  most  part  Dasein  is  not  itself  but  is  lost  in  the  they-self  which  is  an
existentiell  modification  of  the  authentic  Self.  The  question  of  the
ontological constitution of Selfhood has remained unanswered. In principle,
of course, we have already fixed upon a clue for this problem;(xii) for if the
Self  belongs  to  the  essential  [wesenhaften]  attributes  of  Dasein,  while
Dasein’s ‘Essence’ [“Essenz”] lies in existence, then “I”-hood and Selfhood
must  be  conceived  existentially.  On  the  negative  side,  it  has  also  been
shown that our ontological characterization of the “they” prohibits us from
making any use of categories of presence-at-hand (such as substance). It has
become clear, in principle, that ontologically care is not to be derived from
Reality  or  to  be  built  up  with  the  categories  of  Reality.(xiii)  Care  already
harbours in itself the phenomenon of the Self, if indeed the thesis is correct
that the expression ‘care for oneself’ [“Selbstsorge”], would be tautological
if  it  were  proposed  in  conformity  with  the  term  “solicitude”  [Fürsorge]  as
care for Others.(xiv) But in that case the problem of defining ontologically
the  Selfhood  of  Dasein  gets  sharpened  to  the  question  of  the  existential
‘connection’ between care and Selfhood.

To clarify the existentiality of the Self, we take as our ‘natural’ point of
departure  Dasein’s  everyday  interpretation  of  the  Self.  In  saying  “I”,
Dasein  expresses  itself  about  ‘itself’.  It  is  not  necessary  that  in  doing  so
Dasein  should  make  any  utterance.  With  the  ‘I’,  this  entity  has  itself  in
view.  The  content  of  this  expression  is  regarded  as  something  utterly
simple. In each case, it just stands for me and nothing further. Also, this ‘I’,
as  something  simple,  is  not  an  attribute  of  other  Things;  it  is  not  itself  a
predicate,  but  the  absolute  ‘subject’.  What  is  expressed  and  what  is
addressed  in  saying  “I”,  is  always  met  as  the  same  persisting  something.
The characteristics of ‘simplicity’, ‘substantiality’, and ‘personality’, which
Kant,  for  instance,  made  the  basis  for  his  doctrine  ‘of  the  paralogisms  of
pure  reason’,(xv)  arise  from  a  genuine  pre-phenomenological  experience.
The question remains whether that which we have experienced ontically in

this way may be Interpreted ontologically with the help of the ‘categories’
mentioned.

Kant, indeed, in strict conformity with the phenomenal content given in
saying  “I”,  shows  that  the  ontical  theses  about  the  soul-substance  which
have  been  inferred  [erschlossenen]  from  these  characteristics,  are  without
justification. But in so doing, he merely rejects a wrong ontical explanation
of  the  “I”;  he  has  by  no  means  achieved  an  ontological  Interpretation  of
Selfhood, nor has he even obtained some assurance of it and made positive
preparation  for  it.  Kant  makes  a  more  rigorous  attempt  than  his
predecessors to keep hold of the phenomenal content of saying “I”; yet even
though in theory he has denied that the ontical foundations of the ontology
of  the  substantial  apply  to  the  “I”,  he  still  slips  back  into  this  same
inappropriate  ontology.  This  will  be  shown  more  exactly,  in  order  that  we
may establish what it means ontologically to take saying “I” as the starting-
point for the analysis of Selfhood. The Kantian analysis of the ‘I think’ is
now  to  be  adduced  as  an  illustration,  but  only  so  far  as  is  demanded  for
clarifying these problems.(xvi)

The  ‘I’  is  a  bare  consciousness,  accompanying  all  concepts.  In  the  ‘I’,
‘nothing  more  is  represented  than  a  transcendental  subject  of  thoughts’.
‘Consciousness in itself (is) not so much a representation... as it is a form of
representation in general.’(xvii) The ‘I think’ is ‘the form of apperception,
which clings to every experience and precedes it’.(xviii)

Kant grasps the phenomenal content of the ‘I’ correctly in the expression
‘I think’, or—if one also pays heed to including the ‘practical person’ when
one  speaks  of  ‘intelligence’—in  the  expression  ‘I  take  action’.  In  Kant’s
sense we must take saying “I” as saying “I think”. Kant tries to establish the
phenomenal  content  of  the  “I”  as res  cogitans. If  in  doing  so  he  calls  this
“I” a ‘logical subject’, that does not mean that the “I” in general is a concept
obtained  merely  by  way  of  logic.  The  “I”  is  rather  the  subject  of  logical

behaviour,  of  binding  together.  ‘I  think’  means  ‘I  bind  together’.  All
binding together is an ‘I bind together’. In any taking-together or relating,
the  “I”  always  underlies—the  ὑποκείμενον.  The  subjectum  is  therefore
‘consciousness  in  itself’,  not  a  representation  but  rather  the  ‘form’  of
representation. That is to say, the “I think” is not something represented, but
the formal structure of representing as such, and this formal structure alone
makes it possible for anything to have been represented. When we speak of
the  “form”  of  representation,  we  have  in  view  neither  a  framework  nor  a
universal  concept,  but  that  which,  as  εἶδος,  makes  every  representing  and
everything represented be what it is. If the “I” is understood as the form of
representation, this amounts to saying that it is the ‘logical subject’.

Kant’s  analysis  has  two  positive  aspects.  For  one  thing,  he  sees  the
impossibility of ontically reducing the “I” to a substance; for another thing,
he holds fast to the “I” as ‘I think’. Nevertheless, he takes this “I” as subject
again,  and  he  does  so  in  a  sense  which  is  ontologically  inappropriate.  For
the ontological concept of the subject characterizes not the Selfhood of the
“I”  q  u  a   Self,  but  the  selfsameness  and  steadiness  of  something  that  is
always present-at-hand. To define the “I” ontologically as “subject” means
to  regard  it as  something  always  present-at-hand.  The  Being  of  the  “I”  is
understood as the Reality of the res cogitans.(xix)
 

xix.  The  fact  that  in  taking  the  ontological  character  of  the  personal  Self  as  something
‘substantial’, Kant has still kept basically within the horizon of the inappropriate ontology of what is
present-at-hand within-the-world, becomes plain from the material which H. Heimsoeth has worked
over  in  his  essay  ‘Persönlichkeitsbewusstsein  und  Ding  an  sich  in  der  Kantischen  Philosophie’
(reprinted from Immanuel Kant. Festschrift zur zweiten Jahrhundertfeier seines Geburtstages, 1924).
The line taken in the essay goes beyond giving a mere historiological report, and is aimed towards
the ‘categorial’ problem of personality.

Heimsoeth says: ‘Too little note has been taken of the intimate way in which the theoretical and
the practical reason are worked into one another in Kant’s practice and planning; too little heed has
been given to the fact that even here the categories (as opposed to the way in which they are filled in
naturalistically  in  the  ‘principles’)  explicitly  retain  their  validity  and,  under  the  primacy  of  the
practical reason, are to find a new application detached from naturalistic rationalism (substance, for
instance,  in  the  ‘person’  and  personal  immortality;  causality  as  the  ‘causality  of  freedom’;  and
reciprocity in the ‘community of rational creatures’; and so forth). They serve as intellectual fixatives
for a new way of access to the unconditioned, without seeking to give any ratiocinative knowledge of
it as an object.’ (pp. 31 f.)

But here the real ontological problem has been passed over. We cannot leave aside the question
of  whether  these  ‘categories’  can  retain  their  primordial  validity  and  only  need  to  be  applied  in
another way, or whether they do not rather pervert the ontological problematics of Dasein from the
ground up. Even if the theoretical reason has been built into the practical, the existential-ontological
problem of the Self remains not merely unsolved; it has not even been raised. On what ontological
basis is the ‘working into one another’ of the theoretical and the practical reason to be performed? Is
it theoretical or practical behaviour that determines the kind of Being of a person, or neither of them
—and if neither, then what is it? In spite of their fundamental significance, do not the paralogisms
make  manifest  how  ontologically  groundless  are  the  problematics  of  the  Self  from  Descartes’  res
cogitans right up to Hegel’s concept of spirit? One does not need to think either ‘naturalistically’ or
‘rationalistically’, and yet one may be under the domination of the ontology of the ‘substantial’—a
domination which is only more baleful because it is seemingly self-evident.

metaphysischen Motive in der Ausbildung  des Kritischen Idealismus’, Kantstudien, XXIX,  (1924),

But how does it come about that while the ‘I think’ gives Kant a genuine
phenomenal starting-point, he cannot exploit it ontologically, and has to fall
back on the ‘subject’—that is to say, something substantial? The “I” is not
just an ‘I think’, but an ‘I think something’. And does not Kant himself keep
on stressing that the “I” remains related to its representations, and would be
nothing without them?

For  Kant,  however,  these  representations  are  the  ‘empirical’,  which  is
‘accompanied’ by the “I”—the appearances to which the “I” ‘clings’. Kant
nowhere shows the kind of Being of this ‘clinging’ and ‘accompanying’. At
bottom, however, their kind of Being is understood as the constant Being-
present-at-hand  of  the  “I”  along  with  its  representations.  Kant  has  indeed
avoided  cutting  the  “I”  adrift  from  thinking;  but  he  has  done  so  without
starting  with  the  ‘I  think’  itself  in  its  full  essential  content  as  an  ‘I  think

is  ontologically
something’,  and  above  all,  without  seeing  what 
‘presupposed’ in taking the ‘I think something’ as a basic characteristic of
the  Self.  For  even  the  ‘I  think  something’  is  not  definite  enough
the  ‘something’  remains
ontologically  as  a  starting-point,  because 
indefinite. If by this “something” we understand an entity within-the-world,
then  it  tacitly  implies  that  the  world has  been  presupposed;  and  this  very
phenomenon  of  the  world  co-determines  the  state  of  Being  of  the  “I”,  if
indeed  it  is  to  be  possible  for  the  “I”  to  be  something  like  an  ‘I  think
something’. In saying “I”, I have in view the entity which in each case I am
as an ‘I-am-in-a-world’. Kant did not see the phenomenon of the world, and
was consistent enough to keep the ‘representations’ apart from the a priori
content of the ‘I think’. But as a consequence the “I” was again forced back
to  an  isolated  subject,  accompanying  representations  in  a  way  which  is
ontologically quite indefinite.(xx)

In  saying  “I”,  Dasein  expresses  itself  as  Being-in-the-world.  But  does
saying “I” in the everyday manner have itself in view as being-in-the-world
[in-der-Welt-seiend]?  Here  we  must  make  a  distinction.  When  saying  “I”,
Dasein  surely  has  in  view  the  entity  which,  in  every  case,  it  is  itself.  The
everyday interpretation of the Self, however, has a tendency to understand
itself in terms of the ‘world’ with which it is concerned. When Dasein has
itself in view ontically, it fails to see itself in relation to the kind of Being of
that entity which it is itself. And this holds especially for the basic state of
Dasein, Being-in-the-world.(xxi)

What is the motive for this ‘fugitive’ way of saying “I”? It is motivated
by Dasein’s falling; for as falling, it flees in the face of itself into the “they”.
(1)  When  the  “I”  talks  in  the  ‘natural’  manner,  this  is  performed  by  the
they-self.(2) What expresses itself in the ‘I’ is that Self which, proximally
and for the most part, I am not authentically. When one is absorbed in the
everyday  multiplicity  and  the  rapid  succession  [Sich-jagen]  of  that  with
which  one  is  concerned,  the  Self  of  the  self-forgetful  “I  am  concerned’
shows itself as something simple which is constantly selfsame but indefinite

and empty. Yet one is that with which one concerns oneself. In the ‘natural’
ontical  way  in  which  the  “I”  talks,  the  phenomenal  content  of  the  Dasein
which  one  has  in  view  in  the  “I”  gets  overlooked;  but  this  gives  no
justification for our joining in this overlooking of it, or for forcing upon the
problematic  of  the  Self  an  inappropriate  ‘categorial’  horizon  when  we
Interpret the “I” ontologically.
 

1. ‘Durch das Verfallen des Daseins, als welches es vor sich selbst flieht in das Man.’ The ‘es’

appears only in the later editions.

2. ‘Die “natürliche” Ich-Rede vollzieht das Man-selbst.’

Of course by thus refusing to follow the everyday way in which the “I”
talks,  our  ontological  Interpretation  of  the  ‘I’  has  by  no  means  solved  the
problem; but it has indeed prescribed the direction for any further inquiries.
In the “I”, we have in view that entity which one is in ‘being-in-the-world’.
Being-already-in-a-world,  however,  as  Being-alongside-the-ready-to-
hand-within-the-world, means equiprimordially that one is ahead of oneself.
With the ‘I’, what we have in view is that entity for which the issue is  the
Being  of  the  entity  that  it  is.  With  the  ‘I’,  care  expresses  itself,  though
proximally and for the most part in the ‘fugitive’ way in which the “I” talks
when  it  concerns  itself  with  something.  The  they-self  keeps  on  saying  “I”
most  loudly  and  most  frequently  because  at  bottom  it  is  not  authentically
itself  and  evades  its  authentic  potentiality-for-Being.  If  the  ontological
constitution of the Self is not to be traced back either to an “I”-substance or
to a ‘subject’, but if, on the contrary, the everyday fugitive way in which we
keep  on  saying  “I”  must  be  understood  in  terms  of  our  authentic
potentiality-for-Being, then the proposition that the Self is the basis of care
and constantly present-at-hand, is one that still does not follow. Selfhood is
to be discerned existentially only in one’s authentic potentiality-for-Being-
one’s-Self—that is to say, in the authenticity of Dasein’s Being as care. In
terms  of care  the constancy of  the  Self,  as the  supposed persistence of the
subjectum, gets clarified. But the phenomenon of this authentic potentiality-
for-Being also opens our eyes for the constancy of the Self in the sense of its
having achieved some sort of position.(1) The constancy of the Self, in  the
double  sense  of  steadiness  and  steadfastness,  is  the  authentic  counter-
possibility  to  the  non-Self-constancy  which  is  characteristic  of  irresolute
falling.(2)  Existentially,  “Self-constancy”  signifies  nothing  other  than

anticipatory  resoluteness.  The  ontological  structure  of  such  resoluteness
reveals the existentiality of the Self’s Selfhood.
 

1.  ‘…für  die  Ständigkeit  des  Selbst  in  dem  Sinn  des  Standgewonnenhabens.’  Here  our  usual
translation of ‘Ständigkeit’ as ‘constancy’ seems inadequate; possibly ‘stability’ would be closer to
what is meant.

2. ‘Die Ständigkeit des Selbst im Doppelsinne der beständigen Standfestigkeit ist die eigentliche
Gegenmöglichkeit zur Unselbst-ständigkeit des unentschlossenen Verfallens.’ The italicization of the
opening words of this sentence appears only in the later editions.

Here, as on H. 117 and 303, Heidegger exploits various meanings of the adjective ‘ständig’ and
other  words  derived  from  the  base  ‘stā-’,  with  the  root-meaning  of  ‘standing’.  The  noun
‘Unselbständigkeit’  ordinarily  stands  for  inability  to  stand  on  one’s  own  feet  or  to  make  up  one’s
mind  independently.  But  Heidegger  expands  it  to  ‘Unselbst-ständigkeit’,  which  not  only  suggests
instability and a failure to stand by oneself, but also the constancy or stability of that which is other
than  the  Self—the  non-Self,  or  more  specifically,  the  they-self.  In  the  following  sentence  the  noun
‘Selbständigkeit’,  which  ordinarily  stands  for  autonomy,  independence,  or  self-subsistence,  is
similarly expanded to ‘Selbst-ständigkeit’—‘Self-constancy’.

H. 323

 

Dasein  is  authentically  itself  in  the  primordial  individualization  of  the
reticent resoluteness which exacts anxiety of itself. As something that keeps
silent, authentic Being-one’s-Self is just the sort of thing that does not keep
on saying ‘I’; but  in  its reticence it ‘is’ that  thrown  entity  as  which  it  can
authentically  b e. The Self which the reticence of resolute existence unveils
is the primordial phenomenal basis for the question as to the Being of the
‘I’. Only if we are oriented phenomenally by the meaning of the Being of
the  authentic  potentiality-for-Being-one’s-Self  are  we  put  in  a  position  to
discuss  what  ontological  justification  there  is  for  treating  substantiality,
simplicity,  and  personality  as  characteristics  of  Selfhood.  In  the  prevalent
way of saying “I”, it is constantly suggested that what we have in advance
is a Self-Thing, persistently present-at-hand; the ontological question of the
Being of the Self must turn away from any such suggestion.

Care  does  not  need  to  be  founded  in  a  Self.  But  existentiality,  as
constitutive for care, provides the ontological constitution of Dasein’s Self-
constancy,  to  which  there  belongs,  in  accordance  with  the  full  structural
content  of  care,  its  Being-fallen  factically  into  non-Self-constancy.  When
fully  conceived,  the  care-structure  includes  the  phenomenon  of  Selfhood.
This phenomenon is clarified by Interpreting the meaning of care; and it is
as care that Dasein’s totality of Being has been defined.

65. Temporality as the Ontological Meaning of Care

In  characterizing  the  ‘connection’  between  care  and  Selfhood,  our  aim
was not only to clarify the special problem of “I”-hood, but also to help in
the final preparation for getting into our grasp phenomenally the totality of
Dasein’s  structural  whole.  We  need  the  unwavering  discipline  of  the
existential way of putting the question, if, for our ontological point of view,
Dasein’s  kind  of  Being  is  not  to  be  finally  perverted  into  a  mode  of
presence-at-hand,  even  one  which  is  wholly  undifferentiated.  Dasein
becomes  ‘essentially’  Dasein  in  that  authentic  existence  which  constitutes
itself  as  anticipatory  resoluteness.(1)  Such  resoluteness,  as  a  mode  of  the
authenticity  of  care,  contains  Dasein’s  primordial  Self-constancy  and
totality.  We  must  take  an  undistracted  look  at  these  and  understand  them
existentially  if  we  are  to  lay  bare  the  ontological  meaning  of  Dasein’s
Being.
 

1.  ‘Das  Dasein  wird  “wesentlich”  in  der  eigentlichen  Existenz,  die  sich  als  vorlaufende

Entschlossenheit konstituiert.’

H. 324

 

 

What are we seeking ontologically with the meaning of care? What does
“meaning”  signify?  In  our  investigation,  we  have  encountered  this
phenomenon  in  connection  with  the  analysis  of  understanding  and
interpretation.(xxii) According to that analysis, meaning is that wherein the
understandability [Verstehbarkeit] of something maintains itself—even that
of  something  which  does  not  come  into  view  explicitly  and  thematically.
“Meaning”  signifies  the  “upon-which”  [das  Woraufhin]  of  a  primary
projection in terms of which something can be conceived in its possibility
as  that  which  it  is.  Projecting  discloses  possibilities—that  is  to  say,  it
discloses the sort of thing that makes possible.

To lay bare the “upon-which” of a projection, amounts to disclosing that
which makes possible what has been projected.(1) To lay it bare in this way
requires methodologically that we study the projection (usually a tacit one)
which underlies an interpretation, and that we do so in such a way that what
has  been  projected  in  the  projecting  can  be  disclosed  and  grasped  with
regard to its “upon-which”. To set forth the meaning of care means, then, to

follow  up  the  projection  which  guides  and  underlies  the  primordial
existential Interpretation of Dasein, and to follow it up in such a way that in
what  is  here  projected,  its  “upon-which”  may  be  seen.  What  has  been
projected is the Being of Dasein, and it is disclosed in what constitutes that
Being  as  an  authentic  potentiality-for-Being-a-whole.(2)  That  upon  which
the  Being  which  has  been  disclosed  and  is  thus  constituted  has  been
projected, is that which itself makes possible this Constitution of Being as
care.  When  we  inquire  about  the  meaning  of  care,  we  are  asking  what
makes possible the totality of the articulated structural whole of care, in the
unity of its articulation as we have unfolded it.

1.  ‘Das  Woraufhin  eines  Entwurfs  freilegen,  besagt,  das  erschliessen,  was  das  Entworfene
ermöglicht.’ This sentence is ambiguous in that ‘das Entworfene’ (‘what is projected’) may be either
the subject or the direct object of ‘ermöglicht’ (‘makes possible’).

2. ‘Das Entworfene ist das Sein des Daseins und zwar erschlossen in dem, was es als eigentliches
Ganzseinkönnen  konstituiert.’  This  sentence  too  is  ambiguous  in  its  structure;  we  have  chosen  the
interpretation which seems most plausible in the light of the following sentence.

Taken  strictly,  “meaning”  signifies  the  “upon-which”  of  the  primary
projection  of  the  understanding  of  Being.  When  Being-in-the-world  has
been  disclosed  to  itself  and  understands  the  Being  of  that  entity  which  it
itself  is,  it  understands  equiprimordially  the  Being  of  entities  discovered
within-the-world,  even if  such Being  has not  been made a theme,  and has
not  yet  even  been  differentiated  into  its  primary  modes  of  existence  and
Reality. All ontical experience of entities—both circumspective calculation
of the ready-to-hand, and positive scientific cognition of the present-at-hand
—is  based  upon  projections  of  the  Being  of  the  corresponding  entities—
projections  which  in  every  case  are  more  or  less  transparent.  But  in  these
projections  there  lies  hidden  the  “upon-which”  of  the  projection;  and  on
this, as it were, the understanding of Being nourishes itself.

H. 325

If  we  say  that  entities  ‘have  meaning’,  this  signifies  that  they  have
become  accessible  in  their  Being;  and  this  Being,  as  projected  upon  its
“upon-which”,  is  what  ‘really’  ‘has  meaning’  first  of  all.  Entities  ‘have’
meaning only because, as Being which has been disclosed beforehand, they

 

 

become intelligible in the projection of that Being—that is to say, in terms
of  the  “upon-which”  of  that  projection.  The  primary  projection  of  the
understanding  of  Being  ‘gives’  the  meaning.  The  question  about  the
meaning  of the  Being  of an entity  takes as its theme  the  “upon-which”  of
that understanding of Being which underlies all Being of entities.(1)

Dasein  is  either  authentically  or  inauthentically  disclosed  to  itself  as
regards  its  existence.  In  existing,  Dasein  understands  itself;  and  in  such  a
way,  indeed,  that  this  understanding  does  not  merely  get  something  in  its
grasp,  but  makes  up  the  existentiell  Being  of  its  factical  potentiality-for-
Being.  The  Being  which  is  disclosed  is  that  of  an  entity  for  which  this
Being  is  an  issue.  The  meaning  of  this  Being—that  is,  of  care—is  what
makes  care  possible  in  its  Constitution;  and  it  is  what  makes  up
primordially  the  Being  of  this  potentiality-for-Being.  The  meaning  of
Dasein’s  Being  is  not  something  free-floating  which  is  other  than  and
‘outside of’ itself, but is the self-understanding Dasein itself. What makes
possible the Being of Dasein, and therewith its factical existence?

That  which  was  projected  in  the  primordial  existential  projection  of
existence has revealed itself as anticipatory resoluteness. What makes this
authentic Being-a-whole of Dasein possible  with  regard  to  the  unity of its
articulated  structural  whole?(2)  Anticipatory  resoluteness,  when  taken
formally  and  existentially,  without  our  constantly  designating  its  full
structural content, is Being towards one’s ownmost, distinctive potentiality-
for-Being.  This  sort  of  thing  is  possible  only  in  that  Dasein  can,  indeed,
come towards itself in its ownmost possibility, and that it can put up with
this possibility as a possibility in thus letting itself come towards itself—in
other  words,  that  it  exists.  This  letting-itself-come-towards-itself  in  that
distinctive possibility which it puts up with, is the primordial phenomenon
of the future as coming towards.(3) If either authentic or inauthentic Being-
towards-death belongs to Dasein’s Being, then such Being-towards-death is
possible only as something futural [als zukünftiges], in the sense which we
have now indicated, and which we have still to define more closely. By the
term  ‘futural’,  we  do  not  here  have  in  view  a  “now”  which  has  not  yet
become ‘actual’ and which sometime will be for the first time. We have in
view the coming [Kunft] in which Dasein, in its ownmost potentiality-for-
Being,  comes  towards  itself.  Anticipation  makes  Dasein  authentically
futural, and in such a way that the anticipation itself is possible only in so

far as Dasein, as being, is always coming towards itself—that is to say, in
so far as it is futural in its Being in general.
 

1. ‘Die Frage nach dem Sinn des Seins eines Seienden macht das Woraufhin des allem Sein von
Seiendem  zugrundeliegenden  Seinsverstehens  zum  Thema.’  The  earlier  editions  read  ‘...des  allem
ontischen  S e i n  z u  Seiendem...’ (‘...all ontical Being towards entities…’

2.  ‘Was  ermöglicht  dieses  eigentliche  Ganzsein  des  Daseins  hinsichtlich  der  Einheit  seines

gegliederten Strukturganzen?’

3. ‘Das die ausgezeichnete Möglichkeit aushaltende, in ihr sich auf sich Zukommen-lassen ist das
ursprüngliche Phänomen der Zu-kunft.’ While the hyphen in ‘Zukommen-lassen’ appears only in the
later editions, the more important hyphen in ‘Zu-kunft’ appears in both later and earlier editions. In
the later editions, however, it comes at the end of the line, so that the force which was presumably
intended is lost.

Without the hyphen, ‘Zukunft’ is the ordinary word for ‘the future’; with the hyphen, Heidegger
evidently  wishes  to  call  attention  to  its  kinship  with  the  expression  ‘zukommen  auf...’  (‘to  come
towards...’  or  ‘to  come  up  to...’)  and  its  derivation  from  ‘zu’  (‘to’  or  ‘towards’)  and  ‘kommen’
(‘come’).  Hence  our  hendiadys.  (The  use  of  ‘zukommen’  with  the  preposition  ‘auf’  is  to  be
distinguished from a use of this same verb with the dative which we have met in earlier chapters in
the sense of ‘belongs to...’, ‘is becoming to...’, or ‘has coming to…’).

H. 326

 

Anticipatory resoluteness understands Dasein in its own essential Being-
guilty.  This  understanding  means  that  in  existing  one  takes  over  Being-
guilty;  it  means  being  the  thrown  basis  of  nullity.  But  taking  over
thrownness  signifies  being  Dasein  authentically  as  it  already  was.(1)
Taking  over  thrownness,  however,  is  possible  only  in  such  a  way  that  the
futural  Dasein  can  be  its  ownmost  ‘as-it-already-was’—that  is  to  say,  its
‘been’ [sein “Gewesen”]. Only in so far as Dasein is as an “I-am-as-having-
been”, can Dasein come towards itself futurally in such a way that it comes
back.(2) As authentically futural, Dasein is authentically as “having  been”.
(3) Anticipation of one’s uttermost and ownmost possibility is coming back
understandingly  to  one’s  ownmost  “been”.  Only  so  far  as  it  is  futural  can
Dasein  be  authentically  as  having  been.  The  character  of  “having  been”
arises, in a certain way, from the future.(4)
 

1.  ‘Übernahme  der  Geworfenheit  aber  bedeutet,  das  Dasein  in  dem,  wie  es  je  schon  war,

eigentlich sein.’

2.  ‘Nur  sofern  Dasein  überhaupt  ist  als  ich  bin-gewesen,  kann  es  zukünftig  auf  sich  selbst  so
zukommen, dass es zurück-kommt.’ Many German verbs form their perfect tense with the help of the
auxiliary ‘sein’ (‘to be’) in place of the somewhat more usual ‘haben’ (‘have’), just as we sometimes
say in English ‘he is gone’ instead of ‘he has gone’. Among such verbs is ‘sein’ itself. This ‘I have

been’ is expressed by ‘ich bin gewesen’; this might be translated as ‘I am been’, but in this context
we have ventured to translate it as ‘I am as having been’.

3. ‘Eigentlich zukünftig ist das Dasein eigentlich gewesen.’
4.  ‘Die  Gewesenheit  entspringt  in  gewisser  Weise  der  Zukunft.’  Here  ‘The  character  of  having
been’ represents ‘Die Gewesenheit’ (literally, ‘beenhood’). Heidegger distinguishes this sharply from
‘die  Vergangenheit’  (‘pastness’).  We  shall  frequently  translate  ‘Gewesenheit’  simply  as  ‘having
been’.

Anticipatory resoluteness discloses the current Situation of the “there” in
such a way  that existence, in  taking action,  is  circumspectively concerned
with  what  is  factically  ready-to-hand  environmentally.  Resolute  Being-
alongside  what  is  ready-to-hand  in  the  Situation—that  is  to  say,  taking
action  in  such  a  way  as  to  let  one  encounter  what  has  presence
environmentally—is possible only by making such an entity present.  Only
as  the  Present  [Gegenwart](1)  in  the  sense  of  making  present,  can
resoluteness  be  what 
itself  be  encountered
undisguisedly by that which it seizes upon in taking action.

is:  namely, 

letting 

it 

Coming  back  to  itself  futurally,  resoluteness  brings  itself  into  the
Situation by making present. The character of “having been” arises from the
future, and in such a way that the future which “has been” (or better, which
“is in the process of having been”) releases from itself the Present.(2) This
phenomenon has the unity of a future which makes present in the process of
having been; we designate it as “temporality”.(3) Only in so far as Dasein
has  the  definite  character  of  temporality,  is  the  authentic  potentiality-for-
Being-a-whole of anticipatory resoluteness, as we  have described it, made
possible  for  Dasein  itself.  Temporality  reveals  itself  as  the  meaning  of
authentic care.
 

1. On our expressions ‘having presence’, ‘making present’, and ‘the Present’, see our notes 1 and

2 on H. 25 above.

2.  ‘Die  Gewesenheit  entspringt  der  Zukunft,  so  zwar,  dass  die  gewesene  (besser  gewesende)
Zukunft die Gegenwart aus sich entlässt.’ Heidegger has coined the form ‘gewesend’ by fusing the
past participle ‘gewesen’ with the suffix of the present participle ‘-end’, as if in English one were to
write ‘beening’.

3. ‘Dies dergestalt als gewesend-gegenwärtigende Zukunft einheitliche Phänomen nennen wir die

Zeitlichkeit.’

The phenomenal content of this meaning, drawn from the state of Being
term
in 

of  anticipatory  resoluteness,  fills 

the  signification  of 

the 

“temporality”.  In  our  terminological  use  of  this  expression,  we  must  hold
ourselves aloof from all those significations of ‘future’, ‘past’, and ‘Present’
which thrust themselves upon us from the ordinary conception of time. This
holds also for conceptions of a ‘time’ which is ‘subjective’ or ‘Objective’,
‘immanent’  or  ‘transcendent’.  Inasmuch  as  Dasein  understands  itself  in  a
way  which,  proximally  and  for  the  most  part,  is  inauthentic,  we  may
suppose  that  ‘time’  as  ordinarily  understood  does  indeed  represent  a
genuine  phenomenon,  but  one  which  is  derivative  [ein  abkünftiges].  It
arises  from  inauthentic  temporality,  which  has  a  source  of  its  own.  The
conceptions of ‘future’, ‘past’ and ‘Present’ have first arisen in terms of the
inauthentic  way  of  understanding  time.  In  terminologically  delimiting  the
primordial and authentic phenomena which correspond to these, we have to
struggle against the same difficulty which keeps all ontological terminology
in its grip. When violences are done in this field of investigation, they are
not arbitrary but have a necessity grounded in the facts. If, however, we are
to point out without gaps in the argument, how inauthentic temporality has
its source in temporality which is primordial and authentic, the primordial
phenomenon, which we have described only in a rough and ready fashion,
must first be worked out correctly.

If resoluteness makes up the mode of authentic care, and if this itself is
possible only through temporality, then the phenomenon at which we have
arrived  by  taking  a  look  at  resoluteness,  must  present  us  with  only  a
modality of temporality, by which, after all, care as such is made possible.
Dasein’s totality of Being as care means: ahead-of-itself-already-being-in (a
world)  as  Being-alongside  (entities  encountered  within-the-world).  When
we first fixed upon this articulated structure, we suggested that with regard
to  this  articulation  the  ontological  question  must  be  pursued  still  further
back until the unity of the totality of this structural manifoldness has been
laid  bare.(xxiii)  The  primordial  unity  of  the  structure  of  care  lies  in
temporality.

The  “ahead-of-itself”  is  grounded  in  the  future.  In  the  “Being-already-
in...”, the character of “having been” is made known. “Being-alongside…”
becomes possible in making present. While the “ahead” includes the notion
of a “before”,(1) neither the ‘before’ in the ‘ahead’ nor the ‘already’ is to be
taken  in  terms  of  the  way  time  is  ordinarily  understood;  this  has  been
automatically ruled out by what has been said above. With this ‘before’ we
do not have in mind ‘in advance of something’ [das “Vorher”] in the sense

of ‘not yet now—but later’; the ‘already’ is just as far from signifying ‘no
longer now—but earlier’. If the expressions ‘before’ and ‘already’ were to
have a time-oriented [zeithafte] signification such as this (and they can have
this signification too), then to say that care has temporality would be to say
that it is something which is ‘earlier’ and ‘later’, ‘not yet’ and ‘no longer’.
Care would then be conceived as an entity which occurs and runs its course
‘in  time’.  The  Being  of  an  entity  having  the  character  of  Dasein  would
become something present-at-hand. If this sort of thing is impossible, then
any  time-oriented  signification  which  the  expressions  we  have  mentioned
may have, must be different from this. The ‘before’ and the ‘ahead’ indicate
the future as of a sort which would make it possible for Dasein to be such
that  its  potentiality-for-Being  is  an  issue.(2)  Self-projection  upon  the  ‘for-
the-sake-of-oneself’  is  grounded  in  the  future  and  is  an  essential
characteristic of existentiality.  The  primary meaning of  existentiality is  the
future.
 

xxiii. Cf. Section 41, H. 196.

1. We have interpolated this clause in our translation to give point to Heidegger’s remark about
‘the “before” in the “ahead” ’ (‘das “Vor” im “Vorweg” ’), which is obvious enough in German but
would  otherwise  seem  very  far-fetched  in  English.  We  have  of  course  met  the  expression  ‘vor’  in
many  contexts—in  ‘Vorhabe’,  ‘Vorsicht,  and  ‘Vorgriff’  as  ‘fore-structures’  of  understanding  (H.
150), and in such expressions as ‘that in the face of which’ (‘das “Wovor” ’) one fears or flees or has
anxiety (H. 140, 184, 251, etc.). Here, however, the translation ‘before’ seems more appropriate.

2. ‘Das “vor” und “vorweg” zeigt die Zukunft an, als welche sie überhaupt erst ermöglicht, dass
Dasein so sein kann, dass es ihm um sein Seinkönnen geht.’ The pronoun ‘sie’ appears only in the
later editions.

 

 

H. 328

Likewise,  with  the  ‘already’  we  have  in  view  the  existential  temporal
meaning  of  the  Being  of  that  entity  which,  in  so  far  as  it  is,  is  already
something  that  has  been  thrown.  Only  because  care  is  based  on  the
character of “having been”, can Dasein exist as the thrown entity which it
is. ‘As long as’ Dasein factically exists, it is never past [vergangen], but it
always  is  indeed  as  already  having  been,  in  the  sense  of  the  “I  am-as-
having-been”. And only as long as Dasein is, can it be as having been. On
the  other  hand,  we  call  an  entity  “past”,  when  it  is  no  longer  present-at-
hand.  Therefore  Dasein,  in  existing,  can  never  establish  itself  as  a  fact
which is present-at-hand, arising and passing away ‘in the course of time’,

with a bit of it past already. Dasein never ‘finds itself’ except as a thrown
Fact. In the state-of-mind in which it finds itself, Dasein is assailed by itself
as  the  entity  which  it  still  is  and  already  was—that  is  to  say,  which  it
constantly is as having been.(1) The primary existential meaning of facticity
lies in the character of “having been”. In our formulation of the structure of
care, the temporal meaning of existentiality and facticity is indicated by the
expressions ‘before’ and ‘already’.

On the other hand, we lack such an indication for the third item which is
constitutive  for  care—the  Being-alongside  which  falls.  This  should  not
signify  that  falling  is  not  also  grounded  in  temporality;  it  should  instead
give us a hint that making-present, as the primary basis for falling  into the
ready-to-hand  and  present-at-hand  with  which  we  concern  ourselves,
remains included in the future and in having been, and is included in these
in the mode of primordial temporality. When resolute, Dasein has brought
itself  back  from  falling,  and  has  done  so  precisely  in  order  to  be  more
authentically  ‘there’  in  the  ‘moment  of  vision’  as  regards  the  Situation
which has been disclosed.(2)
 

1. ‘In der Befindlichkeit wird das Dasein von ihm selbst überfallen als das Seiende, das es, noch
seiend,  schon  war,  das  heisst  gewesen  ständig  ist.’  We  have  expanded  our  usual  translation  of
‘Befindlichkeit’ to bring out better the connection with the previous sentence.

2.  ‘Entschlossen  hat  sich  das  Dasein  gerade  zurückgeholt  aus  dem  Verafallen,  um  desto
eigentlicher  im  “Augenblick”  auf  die  erschlossene  Situation  “da”  zu  sein.’  The  German  word
‘Augenblick’ has hitherto been translated simply as ‘moment’; but here, and in many later passages,
Heidegger  has  in  mind  its  more  literal  meaning—‘a  glance  of  the  eye’.  In  such  passages  it  seems
more appropriate to translate it as ‘moment of vision’. See Section 68 below, especially H. 338.

Temporality makes possible the unity of existence, facticity, and falling,
and in this way constitutes primordially the totality of the structure of care.
The  items  of  care  have  not  been  pieced  together  cumulatively  any  more
than  temporality  itself  has  been  put  together  ‘in  the  course  of  time’  [“mit
der Zeit”] out of the future, the having been, and the Present. Temporality
‘is’ not an entity at all. It is not, but it temporalizes itself. Nevertheless, we
cannot avoid saying, ‘Temporality “is”... the meaning of care’, ‘Temporality
“is”...  defined  in  such  and  such  a  way’;  the  reason  for  this  can  be  made
intelligible  only  when  we  have  clarified  the  idea  of  Being  and  that  of  the
‘is’  in  general.  Temporality  temporalizes,  and  indeed  it  temporalizes
possible  ways  of  itself.  These  make  possible  the  multiplicity  of  Dasein’s

modes  of  Being,  and  especially  the  basic  possibility  of  authentic  or
inauthentic existence.

H. 329

 

the  ‘time’  which 

The  future,  the  character  of  having  been,  and  the  Present,  show  the
phenomenal characteristics of the ‘towards-oneself’, the ‘back-to’, and the
‘letting-oneself-be-encountered-by’.(1) The phenomena of the “towards...”,
the  “to...”,  and  the  “alongside...”,  make  temporality  manifest  as  the
ἐκστατικόν pure and simple. Temporality is the primordial ‘outside-of-itself’
in  and  for  itself.  We  therefore  call  the  phenomena  of  the  future,  the
character of having been, and the Present, the “ecstases” of temporality.(2)
Temporality is not, prior to this, an entity which first emerges from itself; its
essence is  a process of temporalizing  in  the  unity of the  ecstases.  What is
the  ordinary
characteristic  of 
understanding, consists, among other things, precisely in the fact that it is a
pure sequence of “nows”, without beginning and without end, in which the
ecstatical character of primordial temporality has been levelled off. But this
very levelling off, in accordance with its existential meaning, is grounded in
the possibility of a definite kind of temporalizing, in conformity with which
temporality  temporalizes  as  inauthentic  the  kind  of  ‘time’  we  have  just
mentioned. If, therefore, we demonstrate that the ‘time’ which is accessible
to  Dasein’s  common  sense  is  not  primordial,  but  arises  rather  from
authentic temporality, then,  in  accordance with  the  principle, “a  potiori fit
denominatio”,  we  are  justified  in  designating  as  “primordial  time”  the
temporality which we have now laid bare.
 

is  accessible 

to 

1.  ‘Zukunft,  Gewesenheit,  Gegenwart  zeigen  die  phänomenalen  Charaktere  des  “Auf-sich-zu”,

des “Zurück auf”, des “Begegnenlassens von”.’ On these expressions cf. H. 326 above.

2.  ‘Die  Phänomene  des  zu...,  auf...,  bei...  offenbaren  die  Zeitlichkeit  als  das  ἐκστατικόν
schlechthin. Zeitlichkeit ist das ursprüngliche “Ausser-sich” an und für sich selbst. Wir nennen daher
die charakterisierten Phänomene Zukunft, Gewesenheit, Gegenwart die Ekstasen der Zeitlichkeit.’

The Connection of the words ‘zu’, ‘auf’, and ‘bei’ with the expressions listed in the preceding
sentence, is somewhat obscure even in the German, and is best clarified by a study of the preceding
pages. Briefly the correlation seems to be as follows:

zu: Zukunft; auf sich zukommen; Auf-sich-zu; Sich-vorweg.
auf: Gewesenheit; zurückkommen auf; Zurück auf; Schon-sein-in.
bei: Gegenwart; Begegnenlassen von; Sein-bei.
The  root-meaning  of  the  word  ‘ecstasis’  (Greek  ἔκστασις;  German,  ‘Ekstase’)  is  ‘standing
outside’.  Used  generally  in  Greek  for  the  ‘removal’  or  ‘displacement’  of  something,  it  came  to  be
applied  to  states-of-mind  which  we  would  now  call  ‘ecstatic’.  Heidegger  usually  keeps  the  basic

root-meaning in mind, but he also is keenly aware of its close connection with the root-meaning of
the word ‘existence’.

In enumerating the ecstases, we have always mentioned the future first.
We have done this to indicate that the future has a priority in the ecstatical
unity  of  primordial  and  authentic  temporality.  This  is  so,  even  though
temporality  does  not  first  arise  through  a  cumulative  sequence  of  the
ecstases, but in each case temporalizes itself in their equiprimordiality. But
within this equiprimordiality, the modes of temporalizing are different. The
difference  lies  in  the  fact  that  the  nature  of  the  temporalizing  can  be
determined  primarily  in  terms  of  the  different  ecstases.  Primordial  and
authentic temporality temporalizes itself in terms of the authentic future and
in  such  a  way  that  in  having  been  futurally,  it  first  of  all  awakens  the
Present.(1)  The  primary  phenomenon  of  primordial  and  authentic
temporality is  the  future.  The  priority  of  the  future  will  vary  according  to
the  ways  in  which  the  temporalizing  of  inauthentic  temporality  itself  is
modified,  but  it  will  still  come  to  the  fore  even  in  the  derivative  kind  of
‘time’.(2)

H. 330

 

Care 

is  Being-towards-death.  We  have  defined  “anticipatory
resoluteness”  as  authentic  Being  towards  the  possibility  which  we  have
characterized as Dasein’s utter impossibility. In such Being-towards-its-end,
Dasein exists in a way which is authentically whole as that entity which it
can be when ‘thrown into death’. This entity does not have an end at which
it  just  stops,  but  it  exists  finitely.(3)  The  authentic  future  is  temporalized
primarily by that temporality which makes up the meaning of anticipatory
resoluteness; it thus reveals itself as finite.(4) But ‘does not time go on’ in
spite  of  my  own  no-longer-Dasein?(5)  And  can  there  not  be  an  unlimited
number of things which still lie ‘in the future’ and come along out of it?

We  must  answer  these  questions  affirmatively.  In  spite  of  this,  they  do
not  contain  any  objections  to  the  finitude  of  primordial  temporality—
because  this  is  something  which  is  no  longer  handled  by  these  at  all.  The
question  is  not  about  everything  that  still  can  happen  ‘in  a  time  that  goes
on’, or about what kind of letting-come-towards-oneself we can encounter
‘out of this time’, but about how “coming-towards-oneself” is, as such, to

be  primordially  defined.  Its  finitude  does  not  amount  primarily  to  a
stopping, but is a characteristic of temporalization itself. The primordial and
authentic  future  is  the  “towards-oneself”  (to  oneself!),(6)  existing  as  the
possibility of nullity, the possibility which is not to be outstripped.
 

1. ‘…dass sie zukünftig gewesen allererst die Gegenwart weckt.’
2. ‘…noch in der abkünftigen “Zeit”.’ Here Heidegger is contrasting the authentic kind of time in
which  Dasein  ‘comes  towards’  itself  futurally  [‘auf  sich  zukommt  zukünftig’]  with  the  inauthentic
kind of time which ‘comes off’ from this or is ‘derived’ from it [‘abkommt’], and which is thus of a
‘derivative’ [‘abkünftig’] character.
3. ‘…sondern existiert endlich.’
4.  ‘Die  eigentliche  Zukunft,  die  primär  die  Zeitlichkeit  zeitigt,  die  den  Sinn  der  vorlaufenden

Entschlossenheit ausmacht, enthüllt sich damit selbst als endliche.’

5. ‘Allein “geht” trotz des Nichtmehrdaseins meiner selbst “die Zeit nicht weiter”?’
6. ‘…das Auf-sich-zu, auf sich...’

The ecstatical character of the primordial future lies precisely in the fact
that the future closes one’s potentiality-for-Being; that is to say, the future
itself  is  closed  to  one,(1)  and  as  such  it  makes  possible  the  resolute
existentiell  understanding  of  nullity.  Primordial  and  authentic  coming-
towards-oneself is the meaning of existing in one’s ownmost nullity. In our
thesis that temporality is primordially finite, we are not disputing that ‘time
goes  on’;  we  are  simply  holding  fast  to  the  phenomenal  character  of
primordial temporality—a character which shows itself in what is projected
in Dasein’s primordial existential projecting.

The temptation to overlook the finitude of the primordial and authentic
future and therefore the finitude of temporality, or alternatively, to hold ‘a
priori’ that  such  finitude  is  impossible,  arises  from  the  way  in  which  the
ordinary  understanding  of  time  is  constantly  thrusting  itself  to  the  fore.  If
the ordinary understanding is right in knowing a time which is endless, and
in  knowing  only  this,  it  has  not  yet  been  demonstrated  that  it  also
understands  this  time  and  its  ‘infinity’.  What  does  it  mean  to  say,  ‘Time
goes  on’  or  ‘Time  keep  passing  away?’  What  is  the  signification  of  ‘in
time’  in  general,  and  of  the  expressions  ‘in  the  future’  and  ‘out  of  the
future’ in particular? In what sense is ‘time’ endless? Such points need to be
cleared up, if the ordinary objections to the finitude of primordial time are
not to remain groundless. But we can clear them up effectively only if we
have  obtained  an  appropriate  way  of  formulating  the  question  as  regards
finitude and in-finitude.(2) Such a formulation, however, arises only if we
view the  primordial phenomenon  of time  understandingly.  The problem  is

not one of how(3) the ‘derived’ [“abgeleitete”] infinite  time,  ‘in  which the
ready-to-hand  arises  and  passes  away,  becomes  primordial 
finite
temporality; the problem is rather that of how inauthentic temporality arises
out  of  finite  authentic  temporality,  and  how  inauthentic  temporality,  as
inauthentic,  temporalizes  an  in-finite  time  out  of  the  finite.  Only  because
primordial time is finite can the ‘derived’ time temporalize itself as infinite.
In  the  order  in  which  we  get  things  into  our  grasp  through  the
understanding,  the  finitude  of  time  does  not  become  fully  visible  until  we
have exhibited ‘endless time’ so that these may be contrasted.
 

1. ‘…dass sie das Seinkönnen achliesst, das heisst selbst geschlossen ist...’ The verb ‘schliessen’,
as  here  used,  may  mean  either  to  close  or  shut,  or  to  conclude  or  bring  to  an  end.  Presumably  the
author has both senses in mind.

2. ‘…hinsichtlich der Endlichkeit und Un-endlichkeit...’ We have tried to preserve Heidegger’s
orthographic  distinction  between  ‘Unendlichkeit’  and  ‘Un-endlichkeit’  by  translating  the  former  as
‘infinity’,  the  latter  as  ‘in-finitude’.  We  shall  similarly  use  ‘infinite’  and  ‘in-finite’  for  ‘unendlich’
and ‘un-endlich’ respectively.

3. This word (‘wie’) is italicized only in the later editions.

Our  analysis  of  primordial  temporality  up  to  this  point  may  be
summarized in the following theses. Time is primordial as the temporalizing
of  temporality,  and  as  such  it  makes  possible  the  Constitution  of  the
structure  of  care.  Temporality 
is  essentially  ecstatical.  Temporality
temporalizes itself primordially out of the future. Primordial time is finite.

However,  the  Interpretation  of  care  as  temporality  cannot  remain
restricted to the narrow basis obtained so far, even if it has taken us the first
steps along our way in viewing Dasein’s primordial and authentic Being-a-
whole.  The  thesis  that  the  meaning  of  Dasein  is  temporality  must  be
confirmed in the concrete content of this entity’s basic state, as it has been
set forth.

66.  Dasein’s  Temporality  and  the  Tasks  Arising  Therefrom  of

Repeating the Existential Analysis in a more Primordial Manner
 

Not only does the phenomenon of temporality which we have laid bare
demand  a  more  widely-ranging  confirmation  of  its  constitutive  power,  but

only through such confirmation will it itself come into view as regards the
basic possibilities of temporalizing. The demonstration of the possibility of
Dasein’s  state  of  Being  on  the  basis  of  temporality  will  be  designated  in
brief—though only provisionally—as “the ‘temporal’ Interpretation”.

is 

the  authentic  mode  of  disclosedness, 

Our next task is to go beyond the temporal analysis of Dasein’s authentic
the
potentiality-for-Being-a-whole  and  a  general  characterization  of 
temporality of care so that Dasein’s inauthenticity may  be  made  visible  in
its own specific temporality. Temporality first showed itself in anticipatory
though
resoluteness.  This 
disclosedness  maintains  itself  for  the  most  part  in  the  inauthenticity  with
which the “they” fallingly interprets itself. In characterizing the temporality
of disclosedness in general, we are led to the temporal understanding of that
concernful Being-in-the-world which lies closest to us, and therefore of the
average  undifferentiatedness  of  Dasein  from  which  the  existential  analytic
first took its start.(xxiv) We have called Dasein’s average kind of Being, in
which it maintains itself proximally and for the most part, “everydayness”.
By  repeating  the  earlier  analysis,  we  must  reveal  everydayness  in  its
temporal  meaning,  so  that  the  problematic  included  in  temporality  may
come  to  light,  and  the  seemingly  ‘obvious’  character  of  the  preparatory
analyses may completely disappear. Indeed, confirmation is to be found for
temporality in all the essential structures of Dasein’s basic constitution. Yet
this  will  not  lead  to  running  through  our  analyses  again  superficially  and
schematically  in  the  same  sequence  of  presentation.  The  course  of  our
temporal  analysis  is  directed  otherwise:  it  is  to  make  plainer  the
interconnection of our earlier considerations and to do away with whatever
is accidental and seemingly arbitrary. Beyond these necessities of method,
however,  the  phenomenon  itself  gives  us  motives  which  compel  us  to
articulate our analysis in a different way when we repeat it.

The ontological structure of that entity which, in each case, I myself am,
centres  in  the  Self-subsistence  [Selbständigkeit]  of  existence.  Because  the
Self cannot be conceived either as substance or as subject but is grounded in
existence,  our  analysis  of  the  inauthentic  Self,  the  “they”,  has  been  left
wholly  in  tow  of  the  preparatory  Interpretation  of  Dasein.(xxv)  Now  that
Selfhood  has  been  explicitly  taken  back  into  the  structure  of  care,  and

importance  of 

therefore  of  temporality,  the  temporal  Interpretation  of  Self-constancy  and
non-Self-constancy(1)  acquires  an 
its  own.  This
Interpretation  needs  to  be  carried  through  separately  and  thematically.
However,  it  not  only  gives  us  the  right  kind  of  insurance  against  the
paralogisms  and  against  ontologically  inappropriate  questions  about  the
Being of the “I” in general, but it provides at the same time, in accordance
with its central function, a more primordial insight into the temporalization-
structure of temporality, which reveals itself as the historicality of Dasein.
The  proposition,  “Dasein  is  historical”,  is  confirmed  as  a  fundamental
existential  ontological  assertion.  This  assertion  is  far  removed  from  the
mere  ontical  establishment  of  the  fact  that  Dasein  occurs  in  a  ‘world-
history’.  But  the  historicality  of  Dasein  is  the  basis  for  a  possible  kind  of
historiological understanding which in turn carries with it the possibility of
getting a special grasp of the development of historiology as a science.

H. 333

 

By Interpreting everydayness and historicality temporally we shall get a
steady enough view of primordial time to expose it as the condition which
makes the everyday experience of time both possible and necessary. As an
entity  for  which  its  Being  is  an  issue,  Dasein  utilizes  itself  primarily  for
itself [verwendet sich... für sich selbst], whether it does so explicitly or not.
Proximally  and  for  the  most  part,  care  is  circumspective  concern.  In
utilizing  itself  for  the  sake  of  itself,  Dasein  ‘uses  itself  up’.  In  using  itself
up,  Dasein  uses  itself—that  is  to  say,  its  time.(2)  In  using  time,  Dasein
reckons  with  it.  Time  is  first  discovered  in  the  concern  which  reckons
circumspectively,  and  this  concern  leads  to  the  development  of  a  time-
reckoning.  Reckoning  with  time  is  constitutive  for  Being-in-the-world.
Concernful circumspective discovering, in reckoning with its time, permits
those  things  which  we  have  discovered,  and  which  are  ready-to-hand  or
present-at-hand,  to  be  encountered  in  time.  Thus  entities  within-the-world
become  accessible  as  ‘being  in  time’.  We  call  the  temporal  attribute  of
entities within-the-world “within-time-ness” [die Inner zeitkeit]. The kind of
‘time’ which is first found ontically in within-time-ness, becomes the basis

on which the ordinary traditional conception of time takes form. But time,
as  within-time-ness,  arises  from  an  essential  kind  of  temporalizing  of
primordial temporality. The fact that this is its source, tells us that the time
‘in  which’  what  is  present-at-hand  arises  and  passes  away,  is  a  genuine
phenomenon of time; it is not an externalization of a ‘qualitative time’ into
space,  as  Bergson’s  Interpretation  of  time—which  is  ontologically  quite
indefinite and inadequate—would have us believe.
 

1. ‘…Selbst-ständigkeit und Unselbst-ständigkeit...’ Cf. note 2, H. 322.
2. ‘Umwillen seiner selbst verwendend, “verbraucht” sich das Dasein. Sichverbruchend braucht
das  Dasein  sich  selbst,  dass  heisst  seine  Zeit.’  Here  three  verbs,  all  of  which  might  sometimes  be
translated  as  ‘use’,  are  contrasted  rather  subtly.  ‘Verwenden’  means  literally  to  ‘turn  something
away’, but is often used in the sense of ‘turning something to account’, ‘utilizing it’; in a reflexive
construction such as we have here, it often takes on the more special meaning of ‘applying oneself’
on  someone’s  behalf.  (In  previous  passages  we  have  generally  translated  ‘verwenden’  as  ‘use’.)
‘Verbrauchen’ means to ‘consume’ or ‘use up’. ‘Brauchen’ too means to ‘use’; but it also means to
‘need’, and it is hard to tell which of these senses Heidegger here has in mind.

In working out the temporality of Dasein as everydayness, historicality,
and  within-time-ness,  we  shall  be  getting  for  the  first  time  a  relentless
insight  into  the  complications  of  a  primordial  ontology  of  Dasein.  As
Being-in-the-world,  Dasein  exists  factically  with  and  alongside  entities
which  it  encounters  within-the-world.  Thus  Dasein’s  Being  becomes
ontologically  transparent  in  a  comprehensive  way  only  within  the
horizon(1) in which the Being of entities other than Dasein—and this means
even of those which are neither ready-to-hand nor present-at-hand but just
‘subsist’—has  been  clarified.  But  if  the  variations  of  Being  are  to  be
Interpreted  for  everything  of  which  we  say,  “It  is”,  we  need  an  idea  of
Being in general, and this idea needs to have been adequately illumined in
advance. So long as this idea is one at which we have not yet arrived, then
the  temporal  analysis  of  Dasein,  even  if  we  repeat  it,  will  remain
incomplete and fraught with obscurities; we shall not go on to talk about the
objective difficulties. The existential-temporal analysis of Dasein demands,
for  its  part,  that  it  be  repeated  anew  within  a  framework  in  which  the
concept of Being is discussed in principle.

Horizont…’ In the older editions ‘erst’ appears after ‘daher’ rather than after ‘Durchsichtigkeit’.

67.  The  Basic  Content  of  Dasein’s  Existential  Constitution,  and  a

Preliminary Sketch of the Temporal Interpretation of it
 

H. 334

OUR  preparatory  analysis(i)  has  made  accessible  a  multiplicity  of
phenomena;  and  no  matter  how  much  we  may  concentrate  on  the
foundational structural totality of care, these must not be allowed to vanish
from  our  phenomenological  purview.  Far  from  excluding  such  a
multiplicity,  the  primordial totality  of  Dasein’s  constitution  as  articulated
demands it. The primordiality of a state of Being does not coincide with the
simplicity and uniqueness of an ultimate structural element. The ontological
source of Dasein’s Being is not ‘inferior’ to what springs from it, but towers
above it in power from the outset; in the field of ontology, any ‘springing-
from’ is degeneration. If we penetrate to the ‘source’ ontologically, we do
not  come  to  things  which  are  ontically  obvious  for  the  ‘common
understanding’; but the questionable character of everything obvious opens
up for us.

If  we  are  to  bring  back  into  our  phenomenological  purview  the
phenomena  at  which  we  have  arrived  in  our  preparatory  analysis,  an
allusion to the stages through which we have passed must be sufficient. Our
definition of “care” emerged from our analysis of the disclosedness which
constitutes  the  Being  of  the  ‘there’.  The  clarification  of  this  phenomenon
signified  that  we  must  give  a  provisional  Interpretation  of  Being-in-the-
world—the  basic  state  of  Dasein.  Our  investigation  set  out  to  describe
Being-in-the-world, so that from the beginning we could secure an adequate
phenomenological  horizon  as  opposed  to  those  inappropriate  and  mostly
inexplicit  ways  in  which  the  nature  of  Dasein  has  been  determined
beforehand  ontologically.  Being-in-the-world  was  first  characterized  with
regard  to  the  phenomenon  of  the  world.  And  in  our  explication  this  was

done  by  characterizing  ontico-ontologically  what  is  ready-to-hand  and
present-at-hand ‘in’ the  environment,  and  then  bringing  within-the-world-
ness  into  relief,  so  that  by  this  the  phenomenon  of  worldhood  in  general
to
could  be  made  visible.  But  understanding  belongs  essentially 
disclosedness; and the structure of worldhood, significance, turned out to be
bound up with that upon which understanding projects itself—namely that
potentiality-for-Being for the sake of which Dasein exists.
 

i. Cf. Division One, H. 41-230.

H. 335

 

The  temporal  Interpretation  of  everyday  Dasein  must  start  with  those
structures in which disclosedness constitutes itself: understanding, state-of-
mind, falling, and discourse. The modes in which temporality temporalizes
are to be laid bare with regard to these phenomena, and will give us a basis
for defining the temporality of Being-in-the-world. This leads us back to the
phenomenon  of  the  world,  and  permits  us  to  delimit  the  specifically
temporal  problematic  of  worldhood.  This  must  be  confirmed  by
characterizing  that  kind  of  Being-in-the-world  which  in  an  everyday
manner  is  closest  to  us—circumspective,  falling  concern.  The  temporality
of this concern makes it possible for circumspection to be modified into a
perceiving  which  looks  at  things,  and  the  theoretical  cognition  which  is
grounded  in  such  perceiving.  The  temporality  of  Being-in-the-world  thus
emerges,  and  it  turns  out,  at  the  same  time,  to  be  the  foundation  for  that
spatiality  which  is  specific  for  Dasein.  We  must  also  show  the  temporal
Constitution  of  deseverance  and  directionality.  Taken  as  a  whole,  these
analyses  will  reveal  a  possibility  for  the  temporalizing  of  temporality  in
which Dasein’s inauthenticity is ontologically grounded; and they will lead
us  face  to  face  with  the  question  of  how  the  temporal  character  of
everydayness—the temporal meaning of the phrase ‘proximally and for the
most  part’,  which  we  have  been  using  constantly  hitherto—is  to  be
understood.  By  fixing  upon  this  problem  we  shall  have  made  it  plain  that
the  clarification  of  this  phenomenon  which  we  have  so  far  attained  is
insufficient, and we shall have shown the extent of this insufficiency.

The  present  chapter  is  thus  divided  up  as  follows:  the  temporality  of
disclosedness in general (Section 68); the temporality of Being-in-the-world

 

 

 

and  the  problem  of  transcendence  (Section  69);  the  temporality  of  the
spatiality  characteristic  of  Dasein  (Section  70);  the  temporal  meaning  of
Dasein’s everydayness (Section 71).

68. The Temporality of Disclosedness in General

Resoluteness,  which  we  have  characterized  with  regard  to  its  temporal
meaning, represents an authentic disclosedness of Dasein—a disclosedness
which constitutes an entity of such a kind that in existing, it can be its very
‘there’.  Care  has  been  characterized  with  regard  to  its  temporal  meaning,
but only in its basic features. To exhibit its concrete temporal Constitution,
means to give a temporal Interpretation of the items of its structure, taking
them  each  singly:  understanding,  state-of-mind,  falling,  and  discourse.
Every understanding has its mood. Every state-of-mind is one in which one
understands. The understanding which one has in such a state-of-mind has
the  character  of  falling.  The  understanding  which  has  its  mood  attuned  in
falling, Articulates itself with relation to its intelligibility in discourse. The
current temporal Constitution of these phenomena leads back in each case
to  that  one  kind  of  temporality  which  serves  as  such  to  guarantee  the
possibility  that  understanding,  state-of-mind,  falling,  and  discourse,  are
united in their structure.(1)

(a) The Temporality of Understanding

ii. Cf. Section 31, H. 142 ff.

H. 336

With  the  term  “understanding”  we  have  in  mind  a  fundamental
existentiale, which  is  neither  a  definite  species  of  cognition distinguished,
let  us  say,  from  explaining  and  conceiving,  nor  any  cognition  at  all  in  the
sense of grasping something thematically. Understanding constitutes rather
the  Being  of  the  “there”  in  such  a  way  that,  on  the  basis  of  such
understanding, a Dasein can, in existing, develop the different possibilities
of  sight,  of  looking  around  [Sichumsehens],  and  of  just  looking.  In  all

that  which  one  cannot
explanation  one  uncovers  understandingly 
understand;  and  all  explanation  is  thus  rooted  in  Dasein’s  primary
understanding.

If  the  term  “understanding”  is  taken  in  a  way  which  is  primordially
existential, it means to be projecting(2) towards a potentiality-for-Being for
the sake of which any Dasein exists.
 

1.  ‘Die  jeweilige  zeitliche  Konstitution  der  genannten  Phänomene  führt  je  auf  die  eine
Zeitlichkeit  zurück,  als  welche  sie  die  mögliche  Struktureinheit  von  Verstehen,  Befindlichkeit,
Verfallen und Rede verbürgt.’ The older editions omit the pronoun ‘sie’.

2. ‘…entwerfend-sein...’ The older editions have ‘...e n t w e r f e n d S e i n…’

In understanding, one’s own potentiality-for-Being is disclosed in such a
way that one’s Dasein always knows understandingly what it is capable of.
It  ‘knows’  this,  however,  not  by  having  discovered  some  fact,  but  by
maintaining itself in an existentiell possibility. The kind of ignorance which
corresponds  to  this,  does  not  consist  in  an  absence  or  cessation  of
understanding,  but  must  be  regarded  as  a  deficient  mode  of  the
can  be
projectedness  of  one’s  potentiality-for-Being.  Existence 
questionable.  If  it  is  to  be  possible  for  something  ‘to  be  in  question’  [das
“In-Frage-stehcn”],  a  disclosedness  is  needed.  When  one  understands
oneself  projectively  in  an  existentiell  possibility,  the  future  underlies  this
understanding,  and  it  does  so  as  a  coming-towards-oneself  out  of  that
current  possibility  as  which  one’s  Dasein  exists.  The  future  makes
ontologically  possible  an  entity  which  is  in  such  a  way  that  it  exists
understandingly in its potentiality-for-Being. Projection is basically futural;
it  does  not  primarily  grasp  the  projected  possibility  thematically  just  by
having  it  in  view,  but  it  throws  itself  into  it  as  a  possibility.  In  each  case
Dasein  is  understandingly  in  the  way  that  it  can  be.(1)  Resoluteness  has
turned  out  to  be  a  kind  of  existing  which  is  primordial  and  authentic.
Proximally and for the most part, to be sure, Dasein remains irresolute; that
is  to  say,  it  remains  closed  off  in  its  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being,  to
which it brings itself only when it has been individualized. This implies that
temporality  does  not  temporalize  itself  constantly  out  of  the  authentic
future.  This  inconstancy,  however,  does  not  mean  that  temporality
sometimes  lacks  a  future,  but  rather  that  the  temporalizing  of  the  future
takes various forms.

H. 337

 

To designate the authentic future terminologically we have reserved the
expression “anticipation”. This indicates that Dasein, existing authentically,
lets  itself  come  towards  itself  as  its  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being—that
the  future  itself  must  fist  win  itself,  not  from  a  Present,  but  from  the
inauthentic future. If we are to provide a formally undifferentiated term for
the  future,  we  may  use  the  one  with  which  we  have  designated  the  first

item  of  care—the  “ahead-of-itself”.  Factically,  Dasein 

How  is  the  inauthentic  future  to  be  contrasted  with  this?  Just  as  the
authentic  future  is  revealed  in  resoluteness,  the  inauthentic  future,  as  an
ecstatical mode, can reveal itself only if we go back ontologically from the
inauthentic  understanding  of  everyday  concern  to  its  existential-temporal
meaning. As care, Dasein is essentially ahead of itself. Proximally and for
the most part, concernful Being-in-the-world understands itself in terms of
that with which it is concerned. Inauthentic understanding(2) projects itself
upon  that  with  which  one  can  concern  oneself;  or  upon  what  is  feasible,
urgent, or indispensable in our everyday business. But that with which we
concern ourselves is as it is for the sake of that potentiality-for-Being which
cares.  This  potentiality  lets  Dasein  come  towards  itself  in  its  concernful
Being-alongside  that  with  which  it  is  concerned.  Dasein  does  not  come
towards  itself  primarily  in  its  ownmost  non-relational  potentiality-for-
Being, but it awaits this concernfully in terms of that which yields or denies
the  object  of  its  concern.(3)  Dasein  comes  towards  itself  from  that  with
which  it  concerns  itself.  The  inauthentic  future  has  the  character  of
awaiting.(4) One’s concernful understanding of oneself as they-self in terms
of what one does, has its possibility ‘based’ upon this ecstatical mode of the
future.  And  only  because factical  Dasein  is  thus  awaiting  its  potentiality-
for-Being,  and  is  awaiting  this  potentiality  in  terms  of  that  with  which  it
concerns itself, can it expect anything and wait for it [erwarten und  warten
auf...]. In each case some sort of awaiting must have disclosed the horizon
and the range from which something can be expected. Expecting is founded
upon  awaiting,  and  is  a  mode  of  that  future  which  temporalizes  itself
authentically  as  anticipation.  Hence  there  lies  in  anticipation  a  more
primordial Being-towards-death than in the concernful expecting of it.

2. ‘Das uneigentliche Verstehen...’ Italics only in the later editions.

is not clear whether ‘das Besorgte’ or ‘was’ is the subject of its clause.

4.  ‘…des  Gewärtigens.’  While  the  verb  ‘await’  has  many  advantages  as  an  approximation  to
‘gewärtigen’, it is a bit too colourless and fails to bring out the important idea of being prepared  to
reckon with that which one awaits.

 

 

H. 338

Understanding, as existing in the potentiality-for-Being, however it may
have been projected, is primarily futural. But it would not temporalize itself
if  it  were  not  temporal—that  is,  determined  with  equal  primordiality  by
having been and by the Present. The way in which the latter ecstasis helps
constitute  inauthentic  understanding,  has  already  been  made  plain  in  a
rough  and  ready  fashion.  Everyday  concern  understands  itself  in  terms  of
that  potentiality-for-Being  which  confronts  it  as  coming  from  its  possible
success  or  failure  with  regard  to  whatever  its  object  of  concern  may  be.
Corresponding to the inauthentic future (awaiting), there is a special way of
Being-alongside  the  things  with  which  one  concerns  oneself.  This  way  of
Being-alongside  is  the  Present—the  “waiting-towards”;(1)  this  ecstatical
mode reveals itself if we adduce for comparison this very same ecstasis, but
in  the  mode  of  authentic  temporality.  To  the  anticipation  which  goes  with
resoluteness, there belongs a Present in accordance with which a resolution
discloses the Situation. In resoluteness, the Present is not only brought back
from distraction with the objects of one’s closest concern, but it gets held in
the  future  and  in  having  been.  That  Present  which  is  held  in  authentic
temporality  and  which  thus  is  authentic  itself,  we  call  the  “moment  of
vision”.(2) This term must be understood in the active sense as an ecstasis.
It means the resolute rapture with which Dasein is carried away to whatever
possibilities and circumstances are encountered in the Situation as possible
objects  of  concern,  but  a  rapture  which  is  held  in  resoluteness.(3)  The
moment of vision is a phenomenon which in principle can not  be clarified
in  terms  of  the  “now” [dem Zetzt]. The  “now”  is  a  temporal  phenomenon
which belongs to time as within-time-ness: the “now” ‘in which’ something
arises, passes away, or is present-at-hand. ‘In the moment of vision’ nothing
can  occur;  but  as  an  authentic  Present  or  waiting-towards,  the  moment  of

vision permits us to encounter for the first time what can be ‘in a time’ as
ready-to-hand or present-at-hand.(iii)
 

iii. S. Kierkegaard is probably the one who has seen the existentiell phenomenon of the moment
of  vision  with  the  most  penetration;  but  this  does  not  signify  that  he  has  been  correspondingly
successful in Interpreting  it existentially. He clings to the ordinary  conception of time, and  defines
the  “moment  of  vision”  with  the  help  of  “now”  and  “eternity”.  When  Kierkegaard  speaks  of
‘temporality’,  what  he  has  in  mind  is  man’s  ‘Being-in-time’  [“In-der-Zeit-sein”].  Time  as  within-
time-ness knows  only the “now”;  it never  knows  a moment of vision. If, however, such a moment
gets experienced in an existentiell manner, then a more primordial temporality has been presupposed,
although  existentially  it  has  not  been  made  explicit.  On  the  ‘moment  of  vision’,  cf.  K.  Jaspers,
Psychologie der Weltanschauungen, third unaltered edition, 1925, pp. 108 ff., and further his ‘review
of Kierkegaard’ (ibid., pp. 419-432).
 

1. ‘Gegen-wart’. In this context it seems well to translate this expression by a hendiadys which,
like Heidegger’s hyphenation, calls attention to the root-meaning of the noun ‘Gegenwart’. See our
notes 2, H. 25 and 2, H. 26 above.
2. Cf. note 2, H. 328 above.
3. ‘Er meint die entschlossene, aber in der Erschlossenheit gehaltene Entrückung des Daseins an
das, was in der Situation an besorgbaren Möglichkeiten, Umständen begegnet.’ The verb ‘entrücken’
means  literally  ‘to  move  away’  or  ‘to  carry  away’,  but  it  has  also  taken  on  the  meaning  of  the
‘rapture’  in  which  one  is  ‘carried  away’  in  a  more  figurative  sense.  While  the  words  ‘Entrückung’
and ‘Ekstase’ can thus be used in many contexts as synonyms, for Heidegger the former seems the
more general. (See H. 365 below.) We shall translate ‘entrücken’ by ‘rapture’ or ‘carry away’, or, as
in this case, by a combination of these expressions.

In contradistinction to the moment of vision as the authentic Present, we
call  the  inauthentic  Present  “making present”. Formally  understood,  every
Present is one which makes present, but not every Present has the character
of  a  ‘moment  of  vision’.  When  we  use  the  expression  “making  present”
without  adding  anything  further,  we  always  have  in  mind  the  inauthentic
kind,  which  is  irresolute  and  does  not  have  the  character  of  a  moment  of
vision. Making-present will become clear only in the light of the temporal
Interpretation of falling into the ‘world’ of one’s concern; such falling has
its existential meaning in making present. But in so far as the potentiality-
for-Being  which  is  projected  by  inauthentic  understanding  is  projected  in
terms  of  things  with  which  one  can  be  concerned,  this  means  that  such
understanding temporalizes itself in terms of making present. The moment
of  vision,  however,  temporalizes  itself  in  quite  the  opposite  manner—in
terms of the authentic future.

H. 339

 

Inauthentic  understanding  temporalizes  itself  as  an  awaiting  which
makes  present  [gegenwärtigendes  Geswärtigen]—an  awaiting  to  whose
ecstatical  unity  there  must  belong  a  corresponding  “having  been”.  The
authentic  coming-towards-oneself  of  anticipatory  resoluteness  is  at  the
same  time  a  coming-back  to  one’s  ownmost  Self,  which  has  been  thrown
into  its  individualization.  This  ecstasis  makes  it  possible  for  Dasein  to  be
able  to  take  over  resolutely  that  entity  which  it  already  is.  In  anticipating,
Dasein brings itself again  forth  into its ownmost  potentiality-for-Being.  If
Being-as-having-been is authentic, we call it “repetition”.(1)
 

1.  ‘Im  Vorlaufen  holt  sich  das  Dasein  wieder  in  das  eigenste  Seinkönnen  vor.  Das  eigentliche

Gewesen-sein nennen wir die Wiederholung.’ On ‘Wiederholung’, see H. 385 and our note ad loc.

But when one projects oneself inauthentically towards those possibilities
which have been drawn from the object of concern in making it present, this
is possible only because Dasein has forgotten itself in  its ownmost thrown
potentiality-for-Being. This forgetting is not nothing, nor is it just a failure
to remember; it is rather a ‘positive’ ecstatical mode of one’s having been—
a mode with a character of its own. The ecstasis (rapture) of forgetting has
the character of backing away in the face of one’s ownmost “been”, and of
doing  so  in  a  manner  which  is  closed  off  from  itself—in  such  a  manner,
indeed,  that  this  backing-away  closes  off  ecstatically  that  in  the  face  of
which  one  is  backing  away,  and  thereby  closes  itself  off  too.(1)  Having
forgotten  [Vergessenheit]  as  an  inauthentic  way  of  having  been,  is  thus
related to that thrown Being which is one’s own; it is the temporal meaning
of that Being  in  accordance with  which I am  proximally  and for  the  most
part  as-having-been.  Only  on  the  basis  of  such  forgetting  can  anything  be
retained  [behalten]  by  the  concernful  making-present  which  awaits;  and
what  are  thus  retained  are  entities  encountered  within-the-world  with  a
character  other  than  that  of  Dasein.  To  such  retaining  there  corresponds  a
non-retaining  which presents us with  a kind  of ‘forgetting’ in  a derivative
sense.

Just as expecting is possible only on the basis of awaiting, remembering
is possible only on that of forgetting, and not  v i c e  v e r s a; for  in  the
mode  of  having-forgotten,  one’s  having  been  ‘discloses’  primarily  the
horizon  into  which  a  Dasein  lost  in  the  ‘superficiality’  of  its  object  of

concern,  can  bring  itself  by  remembering.(2)  The  awaiting  which  forgets
and makes present is an ecstatical unity in its own right, in accordance with
which  inauthentic  understanding  temporalizes  itself  with  regard  to  its
temporality.  The  unity  of  these  ecstases  closes  off  one’s  authentic
potentiality-for-Being,  and  is  thus  the  existential  condition  for  the
possibility  of  irresoluteness.  Though  inauthentic  concernful  understanding
determines  itself  in  the  light  of  making  present  the  object  of  concern,  the
temporalizing of the understanding is performed primarily in the future.
 

1.  ‘Die  Ekstase  (Entrückung)  des  Vergessens  hat  den  Charakter  des  sich  selbst  verschlossenen
Ausrückens vor dem eigensten Gewesen, so zwar, dass dieses Ausrücken vor... ekstatisch das Wover
verschliesst und in eins damit sich selbst.’ Heidegger is here connecting the word ‘Entrückung’ (our
‘rapture’) with the cognate verb ‘ausrücken’ (‘back away’), which may be used intransitively in the
military sense of ‘decamping’, but may also be used transitively in the sense of ‘disconnecting’. Both
‘entrücken’ and ‘ausrücken’ mean originally ‘to move away’, but they have taken on very different
connotations in ordinary German usage.

2.  ‘…denn  im  Modus  der  Vergessenheit  “erschliesst”  die  Gewesenheit  primär  den  Horizont,  in
den  hinein  das  an  die  “Äusserlichkeit”  des  Besorgten  verlorene  Dasein  sich  erinnern  kann.’  Here
there  is  presumably  a  deliberate  contrast  between  the  idea  of  externality  in  the  root  meaning  of
‘Äusserlichkeit’ (‘superficiality’) and the idea of putting oneself into something, which is the original
sense of ‘sich erinnern’ (‘to remember’). We have tried to bring this out by our rather free translation
of ‘...in den hinein... sich erinnern…’.

(b) The Temporality of State-of-mind

 

 

iv. Cf. Section 29, H. 134 ff.

H. 340

Understanding  is  never  free-floating,  but  always  goes  with  some  state-
of-mind.  The  “there”  gets  equiprimordially  disclosed  by  one’s  mood  in
every case—or gets closed off by it. Having a mood brings Dasein face to
face with its thrownness in such a manner that this thrownness is not known
as  such  but  disclosed  far  more  primordially  in  ‘how  one  is’.  Existentially,
“Being-thrown”  means  finding  oneself  in  some  state-of-mind  or  other.
One’s  state-of-mind  is  therefore  based  upon  thrownness.  My  mood
represents whatever may be the way in which I am primarily the entity that
has been thrown. How does the temporal Constitution of having-a-mood let
itself  be  made  visible?  How  will  the  ecstatical  unity  of  one’s  current

temporality  give  any  insight  into  the  existential  connection  between  one’s
state-of-mind and one’s understanding?

One’s  mood  discloses  in  the  manner  of  turning  thither  or  turning  away
from one’s own Dasein. Bringing Dasein face to face with the “that-it-is” of
its  own  thrownness—whether  authentically  revealing  it  or  inauthentically
covering  it  up—becomes  existentially  possible  only  if  Dasein’s  Being,  by
its very meaning, constantly is as having been. The “been” is not what first
brings one face to face with the thrown entity which one is oneself; but the
ecstasis of the “been” is what first makes it possible to find oneself in the
way of having a state-of-mind.(1)

temporalizes 

Understanding  is  grounded  primarily  in  the  future;  one’s state-of-mind,
in  having  been.(2)  Moods
however, 
temporalize  themselves—that  is,  their  specific  ecstasis  belongs  to  a  future
and a Present in such a way, indeed, that these equiprimordial ecstases are
modified by having been.

itself  primarily 

We  have  emphasized  that  while  moods,  of  course,  are  ontically  well-
known to us [bekannt], they are not recognized [erkannt] in their primordial
existential  function.  They  are  regarded  as  fleeting  Experiences  which
‘colour’ one’s whole ‘psychical condition’. Anything which is observed to
have  the  character  of  turning  up  and  disappearing  in  a  fleeting  manner,
belongs  to  the  primordial  constancy  of  existence.  But  all  the  same,  what
should moods have in common with ‘time’? That these ‘Experiences’ come
and  go,  that  they  run  their  course  ‘in  time’,  is  a  trivial  thing  to  establish.
Certainly.  And  indeed  this  can  be  established  in  an  ontico-psychological
manner. Our task, however, is to exhibit the ontological structure of having-
a-mood  in  its  existential-temporal  Constitution.  And  of  course  this  is
proximally  just  a  matter  of  first  making  the  temporality  of  moods  visible.
The thesis that ‘one’s state-of-mind is grounded primarily in having been’
means  that  the  existentially  basic  character  of  moods  lies  in  bringing  one
back to something. This bringing-back does not first produce a having been;
but  in  any  state-of-mind  some  mode  of  having  been  is  made  manifest  for
existential  analysis.(3)  So  if  we  are  to  Interpret  states-of-mind  temporally,
our aim is not one of deducing moods from temporality and dissolving them
into pure phenomena of temporalizing. All we have to do is to demonstrate
that except on the basis of temporality, moods are not possible in what they
‘signify’  in  an  existentiell  way  or  in  how  they  ‘signify’  it.  Our  temporal

Interpretation will restrict itself to the phenomena of fear and anxiety, which
we have already analysed in a preparatory manner.
 

1. ‘Das Bringen vor das geworfene Seiende, das man selbst ist, schafft nicht erst das Gewesen,
sondern  dessen  Ekstase  ermöglicht  erst  das  Sich-finden  in  der  Weise  des  Sichbefindens.’  We  have
construed ‘das Gewesen’ and ‘dessen Ekstase’ as the subjects of their respective clauses, but other
interpretations are not impossible.

2. In our italicization we follow the older editions. In the newer editions ‘Gewesenheit’ (‘having

been’) is not italicized.

3.  ‘Dieses  stellt  die  Gewesenheit  nicht  erst  her,  sondern  die  Befindlichkeit  offenbart  für  die
existenziale  Analyse  je  einen  Modus  der  Gewesenheit.’  The  grammar  of  the  first  clause  is
ambiguous.

H. 341

 

We shall begin our analysis by exhibiting the temporality of fear.(v) Fear
has been characterized as an inauthentic state-of-mind. To what extent does
the  existential  meaning  which  makes  such  a  state-of-mind  possible  lie  in
what  has  been?  Which  mode  of  this  ecstasis  designates  the  specific
temporality of fear? Fear is a fearing in the face of something threatening—
of  something  which  is  detrimental  to  Dasein’s  factical  potentiality-for-
Being, and which brings itself close in the way we have described, within
the  range  of  the  ready-to-hand  and  the  present-at-hand  with  which  we
concern ourselves. Fearing discloses something threatening, and it does so
by way of everyday circumspection. A subject which merely beholds would
never be able to discover anything of the sort. But if something is disclosed
when one fears in the face of it, is not this disclosure a letting-something-
come-towards-oneself  [ein  Auf-sich-zukommenlassen]?  Has  not  “fear”
been  rightly  defined  as  “the  expectation  of  some  oncoming  evil”  [eines
ankommenden  Übels]  (“malum futurum”)? Is  not  the  primary  meaning  of
fear  the  future,  and  least  of  all,  one’s  having  been?  Not  only  does  fearing
‘relate’ itself to ‘something future’ in the signification of something which
first  comes  on  ‘in  time’;  but  this  self-relating  is  itself  futural  in  the
primordially  temporal  sense.  All  this  is  incontestable.  Manifestly  an
awaiting  is  one  of  the  things  that  belong  to  the  existential-temporal
Constitution of fear. But proximally this just means that the temporality of
fear is one that is inauthentic. Is fearing in the face of something merely an
expecting  of  something  threatening  which  is  coming  on?  Such  an
expectation need not be fear already, and it is so far from being fear that the

specific character which fear as a mood possesses is missing. This character
lies in the fact that in fear the awaiting lets what is threatening come  back
[zurückkommen] to one’s factically concernful potentiality-for-Being. Only
if that to which this comes back is already ecstatically open, can that which
threatens be awaited right back to the entity which I myself am; only so can
my Dasein be threatened.(1)
 

v. Cf. Section 30, H. 140 ff.

1. ‘Zurück auf das Seiende, das ich bin, kann das Bedrohliche nur gewärtigt, und so das Dasein

bedroht werden, wenn das Worauf des Zurück auf... schon überhaupt ekstatisch offen ist.’

 

 

H. 342

The  awaiting  which  fears  is  one  which  is  afraid  ‘for  itself’;  that  is  to
say, fearing in the face of something, is in each case a fearing about; therein
lies the character of fear as mood and as affect.  When one’s Being-in-the-
world has been threatened and it concerns itself with  the  ready-to-hand,  it
does  so  as  a  factical  potentiality-for-Being  of  its  own.  In  the  face  of  this
potentiality  one  backs  away  in  bewilderment,  and  this  kind  of  forgetting
oneself  is  what  constitutes  the  existential-temporal  meaning  of  fear.(1)
Aristotle  rightly  defines  “fear”  as  λύπη  τις  ἢ  ταραχή—as  “a  kind  of
depression or bewilderment”.(vi) This depression forces Dasein back to its
thrownness,  but  in  such  a  way  that  this  thrownness  gets  quite  closed  off.
The bewilderment is based upon a forgetting. When one forgets and backs
away in the face of a factical potentiality-for-Being which is resolute, one
clings to those possibilities of self-preservation and evasion which one has
already discovered circumspectively beforehand. When concern is afraid, it
leaps from next to next, because it forgets itself and therefore does not take
hold of any definite possibility. Every ‘possible’ possibility offers itself, and
this means that the impossible ones do so too. The man who fears, does not
stop  with  any  of  these;  his  ‘environment’  does  not  disappear,  but  it  is
encountered  without  his  knowing  his  way  about  in  it  any  longer.(2)  This
bewildered making-present of the first thing that comes into one’s head, is
something that belongs with forgetting oneself in fear. It is well known, for
instance, that the inhabitants of a burning house will often ‘save’ the most
indifferent  things  that  are  most  closely  ready-to-hand.  When  one  has
forgotten oneself and makes present a jumble of hovering possibilities, one

 

 

thus  makes  possible  that  bewilderment  which  goes  to  make  up  the  mood-
character  of  fear.(3)  The  having  forgotten  which  goes  with  such
bewilderment  modifies  the  awaiting  too  and  gives  it  the  character  of  a
depressed  or  bewildered  awaiting  which  is  distinct  from  any  pure
expectation.
 

vi. Cf. Aristotle, Rhetorica B 5, 1382a 21.

1.  ‘Deren  existenzial-zeitlicher  Sinn  wird  konstituiert  durch  ein  Sichvergessen:  das  verwirrte
Ausrücken  vor  dem  eigenen  faktischen  Seinkönnen,  als  welches  das  bedrohte  In-der-Welt-sein  das
Zuhandene besorgt.’

2. ‘Bei keiner hält der Fürchtende, die “Umwelt” verschwindet nicht, sondern begegnet in einem

Sich-nicht-mehr-auskennen in ihr.’

3.  ‘Das  selbstvergessene  Gegenwärtigen  eines  Gewirrs  von  schwebenden  Möglichkeiten
ermöglicht  die  Verwirrung,  als  welche  sie  den  Stimmungscharakter  der  Furcht  ausmacht.’  The
pronoun ‘sie’ does not appear in the older editions.

The specific ecstatical unity which makes it existentially possible to be
afraid,  temporalizes  itself  primarily  out  of  the  kind  of  forgetting
characterized above, which, as a mode of having been, modifies its Present
and  its  future  in  their  own  temporalizing.  The  temporality  of  fear  is  a
forgetting  which  awaits  and  makes  present.  The  common-sense
interpretation of fear, taking its orientation from what we encounter within-
the-world, seeks in the first instance to designate the ‘oncoming evil’ as that
in the face of which we fear, and, correspondingly, to define our relation to
this  evil  as  one  of  “expecting”.  Anything  else  which  belongs  to  the
phenomenon remains a ‘feeling of pleasure or displeasure’.

H. 343

How is the temporality of anxiety related to that of fear? We have called
the  phenomenon  of  anxiety  a  basic  state-of-mind.(vii)  Anxiety  brings
Dasein  face  to  face  with  its  ownmost  Being-thrown  and  reveals  the
uncanniness of everyday familiar Being-in-the-world. Anxiety, like fear, has
its character formally determined by something in the face of which one is
anxious  and  something  about which  one  is  anxious.  But  our  analysis  has
shown  that  these  two  phenomena  coincide.  This  does  not  mean  that  their
structural  characters  are  melted  away  into  one  another,  as  if  anxiety  were
anxious neither in the face of anything nor about anything. Their coinciding

means rather that the entity by which both these structures are filled in [das
sie  erfüllende  Seiende]  is  the  same—namely  Dasein.  In  particular,  that  in
the face of which one has anxiety is not encountered as something definite
with  which  one  can  concern  oneself;  the  threatening  does  not  come  from
what  is  ready-to-hand  or  present-at-hand,  but  rather  from  the  fact  that
neither  of  these  ‘says’  anything  any  longer.  Environmental  entities  no
longer  have  any  involvement.  The  world  in  which  I  exist  has  sunk  into
insignificance;  and  the  world  which  is  thus  disclosed  is  one  in  which
entities  can  be  freed  only  in  the  character  of  having  no  involvement.
Anxiety is anxious in the face of the “nothing” of the world; but this does
not mean that in anxiety we experience something like the absence of what
is  present-at-hand  within-the-world.  The  present-at-hand  must  be
encountered  in  just  such  a  way  that  it  does  not  have  any  involvement
whatsoever,  but  can  show  itself  in  an  empty  mercilessness.  This  implies,
however,  that  our  concernful  awaiting  finds  nothing  in  terms  of  which  it
might be able to understand itself; it clutches at the “nothing” of the world;
but when our understanding has come up against the world, it is brought to
Being-in-the-world  as  such  through  anxiety.  Being-in-the  world,  however,
is both what anxiety is anxious in-the-face-of and what it is anxious about.
To be anxious in-the-face-of... does not have the character of an expecting
or  of  any  kind  of  awaiting.  That  in-the-face-of  which  one  has  anxiety  is
indeed already ‘there’—namely, Dasein itself. In that case, does not anxiety
get  constituted by a future? Certainly;  but  not  by  the  inauthentic  future of
awaiting.

Anxiety discloses an insignificance of the world; and this insignificance
reveals the nullity of that with which one can concern oneself—or, in other
words, the impossibility of projecting oneself upon a potentiality-for-Being
which  belongs  to  existence  and  which  is  founded  primarily  upon  one’s
objects  of  concern.  The  revealing  of  this  impossibility,  however,  signifies
that one is letting the possibility of an authentic potentiality-for-Being be lit
up.  What  is  the  temporal  meaning  of  this  revealing?  Anxiety  is  anxious
about naked Dasein as something that has been thrown into uncanniness. It
brings  one  back  to  the  pure  “that-it-is”  of  one’s  ownmost  individualized
thrownness.  This  bringing-back  has  neither  the  character  of  an  evasive
forgetting  nor  that  of  a  remembering.  But  just  as  little  does  anxiety  imply
that  one  has  already  taken  over  one’s  existence  into  one’s  resolution  and
done  so  by  a  repeating.  On  the  contrary,  anxiety  brings  one  back  to  one’s

thrownness as something possible which can be repeated. And in  this way
it  also  reveals  the  possibility  of  an  authentic  potentiality-for-Being—a
potentiality which must, in repeating, come back to its thrown “there”, but
come  back  as  something  futural  which  comes  towards  [zukünftiges].  The
character of having been is constitutive for the state-of-mind of anxiety; and
bringing one face to face with repeatability is the specific ecstatical mode of
this character.
 

vii. Cf. Section 40, H. 184 ff.

H. 344

 

The forgetting which is constitutive for fear, bewilders Dasein and lets it
drift back and forth between ‘worldly’ possibilities which it has not seized
upon. In contrast to this making-present which is not held on to, the Present
of  anxiety  is  held  on  to  when  one  brings  oneself  back  to  one’s  ownmost
thrownness.  The  existential  meaning  of  anxiety  is  such  that  it  cannot  lose
itself in something with which it might be concerned. If anything like this
happens  in  a  similar  state-of-mind,  this  is  fear,  which  the  everyday
understanding  confuses  with  anxiety.  But  even  though  the  Present  of
anxiety is held on to, it does not as yet have the character of the moment of
vision, which temporalizes itself in a resolution. Anxiety merely brings one
into  the  mood  for  a  possible resolution.  The  Present  of  anxiety  holds  the
moment of vision at the ready [auf dem Sprung]; as such a moment it itself,
and only itself, is possible.

The  temporality  of  anxiety  is  peculiar;  for  anxiety  is  grounded
primordially  in  having  been,  and  only  out  of  this  do  the  future  and  the
Present temporalize themselves; in this peculiar temporality is demonstrated
the possibility of that power which is distinctive for the mood of anxiety. In
this, Dasein is taken all the way back to its naked uncanniness, and becomes
fascinated  by  it.(1)  This  fascination,  however,  not  only  takes  Dasein  back
from its ‘worldly’ possibilities, but at the same time gives it the possibility
of an authentic potentiality-for-Being.
 

1.  ‘An  der  eigentümlichen  Zeitlichkeit  der  Angst,  dass  sie  ursprünglich  in  der  Gewesenheit
gründet  und  aus  ihr  erst  Zukunft  und  Gegenwart  sich  zeitigen,  erweist  sich  die  Mögichkeit  der
Mächtigkeit,  durch  die  sich  die  Stimmung  der  Angst  auszeichnet.  In  ihr  ist  das  Dasein  völlig  auf
seine nackte Unheimlichkeit zurückgenommen und von ihr benommen.’ In these two sentences there

are no less than six feminine nouns which might serve as the antecedents of the pronouns ‘sie’ and
‘ihr’ in their several appearances. We have chosen the interpretation which seems most plausible to
us,  but  others  are  perhaps  no 
less  defensible.  The  etymological  connection  between
‘zurückgenommen’ (‘taken… back’) and ‘benommen’ (‘fascinated’) does not show up in the English
version; it is obviously deliberate, and it gets followed up in the next sentence.

Yet neither of these moods, fear and anxiety, ever ‘occurs’ just isolated
in  the  ‘stream of Experiences’; each of them determines  an understanding
or determines itself in terms of one.(1) Fear is occasioned by entities with
which  we  concern  ourselves  environmentally.  Anxiety,  however,  springs
from Dasein itself. When fear assails us, it does so from what is within-the-
world. Anxiety arises out of Being-in-the-world as thrown Being-towards-
death.  When  understood  temporally,  this  ‘mounting’  of  anxiety  out  of
Dasein,  means  that  the  future  and  the  Present  of  anxiety  temporalize
themselves  out  of  a  primordial  Being-as-having-been  in  the  sense  of
bringing us back to repeatability. But anxiety can mount authentically only
in  a  Dasein  which  is  resolute.  He  who  is  resolute  knows  no  fear;  but  he
understands  the  possibility  of  anxiety  as  the  possibility  of  the  very  mood
which  neither  inhibits  nor  bewilders  him.  Anxiety  liberates  him  from
possibilities which ‘count for  nothing’  [“nichtigen”], and lets  him become
free for those which are authentic.

H. 345

 

Although both fear and anxiety, as modes of state-of-mind, are grounded
primarily  in  having  been, they  each  have  different  sources  with  regard  to
their own temporalization in the temporality of care. Anxiety springs from
the future of resoluteness, while fear springs from the lost Present, of which
fear is fearfully apprehensive, so that it falls prey to it more than ever.(2)
 

1.  ‘Beide  Stimmungen,  Furcht  und  Angst,  “kommen”  jedoch  nie  nur  isoliert  “vor”  im
“Erlebnisstrom”,  sondern  be-stimmen  je  ein  Verstehen,  bzw.  sich  aus  einem  solchen.’  Heidegger
writes  ‘be-stimmen’  with  a  hyphen  to  call  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  words  ‘bestimmen’
(‘determine’) and ‘Stimmung’ (‘mood’) have a common stem.

2.  ‘Die  Angst  entspringt  aus  der  Zukunft  der  Entschlossenheit,  die  Furcht  aus  der  verlorenen
Gegenwart, die furchtsam die Furcht befürchtet, um ihr so erst recht zu verfallen.’ The grammar of
this passage is ambiguous, and would also permit us to write: ‘…the lost Present, which is fearfully
apprehensive of fear, so that…’

But may not the thesis of the temporality of moods hold only for those
phenomena  which  we  have  selected  for  our  analysis?  How  is  a  temporal
meaning to be found in the pallid lack of mood which dominates the ‘grey
everyday’  through  and  through?  And  how  about  the  temporality  of  such
moods  and  affects  as  hope,  joy,  enthusiasm,  gaiety?  Not  only  fear  and
anxiety, but other moods, are founded existentially upon one’s having been;
this  becomes  plain  if  we  merely  mention  such  phenomena  as  satiety,
sadness, melancholy, and desperation. Of course these must be Interpreted
on the broader basis of an existential analytic of Dasein that has been well
worked out. But even a phenomenon like hope, which seems to be founded
wholly  upon  the  future,  must  be  snalysed  in  much  the  same  way  as  fear.
Hope  has  sometimes  been  characterized  as  the  expectation  of  a  bonum
futurum, to distinguish it from fear, which relates itself to a malum futurum.
But  what  is  decisive  for  the  structure  of  hope  as  a  phenomenon,  is  not  so
much  the  ‘futural’ character of that to  which it  relates  itself  but  rather  the
existential meaning of hoping itself. Even here its character as a mood lies
primarily in hoping as hoping for something for oneself [Für-sich-erhoffen].
He who hopes takes himself with him into his hope, as it were, and brings
himself  up  against  what  he  hopes  for.  But  this  presupposes  that  he  has
somehow  arrived  at  himself.  To  say  that  hope  brings  alleviation
[erleichtert] from depressing misgivings, means merely that even hope, as a
state-of-mind,  is  still  related  to  our  burdens,  and  related  in  the  mode  of
Being-as-having been. Such a mood of elation—or better, one which elates
—is ontologically possible only if Dasein has an ecstatico-temporal relation
to the thrown ground of itself.

Furthermore,  the  pallid  lack  of  mood—indifference—which  is  addicted
to  nothing  and  has  no  urge  for  anything,  and  which  abandons  itself  to
whatever the day may bring, yet in so doing takes everything along with it
in  a  certain  manner,  demonstrates  most  penetratingly  the  power  of
forgetting in the everyday mode of that concern which is closest to us. Just
living along [Das Dahinleben] in a way which ‘lets’ everything ‘be’ as it is,
is  based  on  forgetting  and  abandoning  oneself  to  one’s  thrownness.  It  has
the ecstatical meaning of an inauthentic way of having been. Indifference,
which can go along with busying oneself head over heels, must be sharply
distinguished from equanimity. This latter mood springs from resoluteness,
which,  in  a  moment  of  vision,  looks  at(1)  those  Situations  which  are

 

 

 

possible  in  one’s  potentiality-for-Being-a-whole  as  disclosed  in  our
anticipation of [zum] death.

H. 346

Only an entity which, in accordance with the meaning of its Being, finds
itself  in  a  state-of-mind  [sich  befindet]—that  is  to  say,  an  entity,  which  in
existing, is as already having been, and which exists in a constant mode of
what  has  been—can  become  affected.  Ontologically  such  affection
presupposes  making-present,  and  indeed  in  such  a  manner  that  in  this
making-present Dasein can be brought back to itself as something that has
been. It remains a problem in itself to define ontologically the way in which
the senses can be stimulated or touched  in  something that merely  has life,
and how and where(2) the Being of animals, for instance, is constituted by
some kind of ‘time’.
 

1. ‘…die augenblicklich ist auf...’
2. ‘…wie und wo...’ The earlier editions have ‘...wie und ob...’ (‘...how and whether...’).

(c) The Temporality of Falling

viii. Cf. Section 38, H. 175 ff.

In  our  temporal  Interpretation  of  understanding  and  state-of-mind,  we
not  only  have  come  up  against  a  primary  ecstasis  for  each  of  these
phenomena,  but  at  the  same  time  we  have  always  come  up  against
temporality as a whole. Just as understanding is made possible primarily by
the  future,  and  moods  are  made  possible  by  having  been,  the  third
constitutive  item  in  the  structure  of  care—namely,  falling—has  its
existential  meaning  in  the  Present.  Our  preparatory  analysis  of  falling
began with an Interpretation of idle talk, curiosity, and ambiguity.(ix) In the
temporal  analysis  of  falling  we  shall  take  the  same  course.  But  we  shall
restrict our investigation to a consideration of curiosity, for here the specific
temporality  of  falling  is  most  easily  seen.  Our  analysis  of  idle  talk  and
ambiguity, however, presupposes our having already clarified the temporal
Constitution of discourse and of explanation (interpretation).

Curiosity is a distinctive tendency of Dasein’s Being, in accordance with
which  Dasein  concerns  itself  with  a  potentiality-for-seeing.(x)  Like  the
concept  of  sight,  ‘seeing’  will  not  be  restricted  to  awareness  through  ‘the
eyes  of  the  body’.  Awareness  in  the  broader  sense  lets  what  is  ready-to-
hand  and  what  is  present-at-hand  be  encountered  ‘bodily’  in  themselves
with  regard  to  the  way  they  look.  Letting  them  be  thus  encountered  is
grounded  in  a  Present.  This  Present  gives  us  in  general  the  ecstatical
horizon within which entities can have bodily presence. Curiosity, however,
does not make present the present-at-hand in order to tarry alongside it and
understand it; it seeks to see only in order to see and to have seen. As this
making-present  which  gets  entangled  in  itself,  curiosity  has  an  ecstatical
unity  with  a  corresponding  future  and  a  corresponding  having  been.  The
craving for the new(1) is of course a way of proceeding towards something
not yet seen, but in such a manner that the making-present seeks to extricate
itself  from  awaiting.  Curiosity  is  futural  in  a  way  which  is  altogether
inauthentic,  and  in  such  a  manner,  moreover,  that  it  does  not  await  a
possibility, but,  in  its  craving,  just  desires  such  a  possibility  as  something
that  is  actual.  Curiosity  gets  constituted  by  a  making-present  which  is  not
held on to, but which, in merely making present, thereby seeks constantly to
run  away  from  the  awaiting  in  which  it  is  nevertheless  ‘held’,  though  not
held on to.(2)
 

ix. Cf. Sections 35 ff., H. 167 ff.
x. Cf. Section 36, H. 170 ff.

1. ‘Die Gier nach dem Neuen...’ Here Heidegger calls attention to the etymological structure of

the word ‘Neugier’ (‘curiosity’).

2.  ‘Die  Neugier  wird  konstituiert  durch  ein  ungehaltenes  Gegenwärtigen,  das,  nur
gegenwärtigend,  damit  ständig  dem  Gewärtigen,  darin  es  doch  ungehalten  “gehalten”  ist,  zu
entlaufen  sucht.’  This  sentence  involves  a  play  on  the  words  ‘Gewärtigen’  and  ‘Gegenwärtigen’,
‘gehalten’ and ‘ungehalten’, which is not easily reproduced. While ‘ungehalten’ can mean ‘not held
on to’ (as we have often translated it), it can also mean that one can no longer ‘contain’ oneself, and
becomes  ‘indignant’  or  ‘angry’.  In  the  present  passage,  Heidegger  may  well  have  more  than  one
meaning  in  mind.  The  point  would  be  that  in  curiosity  we  are  kept  (or  ‘held’)  awaiting  something
which we ‘make present’ to ourselves so vividly that we try to go beyond the mere awaiting of it and
become irritated or indignant because we are unable to do so. So while we are ‘held’ in our awaiting,
we do not ‘hold on to it’.

 

 

H. 347

The Present ‘arises or leaps away’ from the awaiting which belongs to
it,  and  it  does  so  in  the  sense  of  running  away  from  it,  as  we  have  just
emphasized.(1)  But  the  making-present  which  ‘leaps  away’  in  curiosity  is
so little devoted to the ‘thing’ it is curious about, that when it obtains sight
of  anything  it  already  looks  away  to  what  is  coming  next.  The  making-
present  which  ‘arises  or  leaps  away’  from  the  awaiting  of  a  definite
possibility which one has taken hold  of, makes possible  ontologically that
not-tarrying which is distinctive of curiosity. The making-present does not
‘leap away’ from the awaiting in such a manner, as it were, that it detaches
itself  from  that  awaiting  and  abandons  it  to  itself  (if  we  understand  this
ontically).  This  ‘leaping-away’  is  rather  an  ecstatical  modification  of
awaiting,  and  of  such  a  kind  that  the  awaiting  leaps  after  the  making-
present.(2) The awaiting gives itself up, as it were; nor does it any longer let
any  inauthentic  possibilities  of  concern  come  towards  it  from  that  with
which  it  concerns  itself,  unless  these  are  possibilities  only  for  a  making-
present which is not held on to. When the awaiting is ecstatically modified
by  the  making-present  which  leaps  away,  so  that  it  becomes  an  awaiting
which leaps after, this modification is the existential-temporal condition for
the possibility of distraction.
 

1.  ‘Die  Gegenwart  “entspringt”  dem  zugehörigen  Gewärtigen  in  dem  betonten  Sinne  des
Entlaufens.’ While the verb ‘entspringen’ can mean ‘arise from’ or ‘spring from’, as it usually does
in this work, it can also mean ‘run away from’ or ‘escape from’, as Heidegger says it does here. We
shall accordingly translate it in this context by the more literal ‘leap away’ or occasionally by ‘arise
or leap away’. The point of this passage will perhaps be somewhat plainer if one keeps in mind that
when  Heidegger  speaks  of  the  ‘Present’  (‘Gegenwart’)  or  ‘making-present’  (‘Gegenwärtigen’)  as
‘leaping away’, he is using these nouns in the more literal sense of ‘waiting towards’. Thus in one’s
‘present’ curiosity, one ‘leaps away’ from what one has been ‘awaiting’, and does so by ‘waiting for’
something different.

2.  ‘…dass  dieses  dem  Gegenwärtigen  nachspringt.’  The  idea  seems  to  be  that  when  curiosity
‘makes present’ new possibilities, the current awaiting is re-directed towards these instead of towards
the possibilities which have been awaited hitherto.

Through the awaiting which leaps after, on the other hand, the making-
present is abandoned more and more to itself. It makes present for the sake
of  the  Present.  It  thus  entangles  itself  in  itself,  so  that  the  distracted  not-
tarrying becomes never-dwelling-anywhere. This latter mode of the Present
is  the  counter-phenomenon  at  the  opposite  extreme  from  the  moment  of
vision.  In  never  dwelling  anywhere,  Being-there  is  everywhere  and

nowhere.  The  moment  of  vision,  however,  brings  existence  into  the
Situation and discloses the authentic ‘there’.

The  more  inauthentically  the  Present  is—that  is,  the  more  making-
present  comes  towards  ‘itself’—the  more  it  flees  in  the  face  of  a  definite
potentiality-for-Being and closes it off; but in that case, all the less can the
future  come  back  to  the  entity  which  has  been  thrown.  In  the  ‘leaping-
away’  of  the  Present,  one  also  forgets  increasingly.  The  fact  that  curiosity
always  holds  by  what  is  coming  next,  and  has  forgotten  what  has  gone
before,(1)  is  not  a  result  that  ensues  only  from  curiosity,  but  is  the
ontological condition for curiosity itself.

H. 348

 

As  regards  their  temporal  meaning,  the  characteristics  of  falling  which
tranquillization,  alienation,  self-
we  have  pointed  out—temptation, 
entanglement—mean  that  the  making-present  which  ‘leaps  away’  has  an
ecstatical  tendency  such  that  it  seeks  to  temporalize  itself  out  of  itself.
When  Dasein  entangles  itself,  this  has  an  ecstatical  meaning.  Of  course
when one speaks of the rapture with which one’s existence is carried away
in making present, this does not signify that Dasein detaches itself from its
Self and its “I”. Even when it makes present in the most extreme manner, it
remains  temporal—that  is,  awaiting  and  forgetful.  In  making  present,
moreover, Dasein still understands itself, though it has been alienated from
its  ownmost  potentiality-for-Being,  which  is  based  primarily  on  the
authentic future and on authentically having been. But in so far as making-
present  is  always  offering  something  ‘new’,  it  does  not  let  Dasein  come
back  to  itself  and  is  constantly  tranquillizing  it  anew.  This  tranquillizing,
however, strengthens in turn the tendency towards leaping away. Curiosity
is  ‘activated’ not  by the  endless immensity of what we  have not  yet  seen,
but rather by the falling kind of temporalizing which belongs to the Present
as it leaps away.(2) Even if one has seen everything, this is precisely when
curiosity fabricates something new.

As  a  mode  of  temporalizing,  the  ‘leaping-away’  of  the  Present  is
grounded in the essence of temporality, which is finite. Having been thrown
into  Being-towards-death,  Dasein  flees—proximally  and  for  the  most  part
—in  the  face  of  this  thrownness,  which  has  been  more  or  less  explicitly
revealed.  The  Present  leaps  away  from  its  authentic  future  and  from  its

authentic having been, so that it lets Dasein come to its authentic existence
only  by  taking  a  detour  through  that  Present.  The  ‘leaping-away’  of  the
Present—that is, the falling into lostness—has its source in that primordial
authentic  temporality  itself  which  makes  possible  thrown  Being-towards-
death.(3)
 

1. ‘…beim Nächsten hält und das Vordem vergessen hat...’
2.  ‘Nicht  die  endlose  Unübersehbarkeit  dessen,  was  noch  nicht  gesehen  ist,  “bewirkt”  die
Neugier,  sondern  die  verfallende  Zeitigungsart  der  entspringenden  Gegenwart.’  This  sentence  is
grammatically ambiguous.

3.  ‘Der  Ursprung  des  “Entspringens”  der  Gegenwart,  das  heisst  des  Verfallens  in  die
Verlorenheilt, ist die ursprüngliche, eigentliche Zeitlichkeit selbst, die das geworfene Sein zum Tode
ermöglicht.’  Our  conventions for translating ‘Ursprung’  as ‘source’,  ‘ursprünglich’  as ‘primordial’,
and  ‘entspringen’  as  ‘leap  away’,  conceal  Heidegger’s  exploitation  of  the  root  ‘spring-’  in  this
passage.

While  Dasein  can  indeed  be  brought  authentically  face to  face  with  its
thrownness,  so  as  to  understand  itself  in  that  thrownness  authentically,
nevertheless, this thrownness remains closed off from Daseis, as regards the
ontical “whence” and “how” of it. But the fact that it is thus closed off is by
no means just a kind of ignorance factually subsisting; it is constitutive for
Dasein’s facticity. It is also determinative for the ecstatical character of the
way existence has been abandoned to its own null basis.

H. 349

 

Proximally, the “throw” of Dasein’s Being-thrown into the world is one
that  does  not  authentically  get  “caught”.  The  ‘movement’  which  such  a
“throw”  implies  does  not  come  to  ‘a  stop’  because  Dasein  now  ‘is  there’.
Dasein gets dragged along in thrownness; that is to say, as something which
has been thrown into the  world, it loses itself in  the  ‘world’  in  its factical
submission  to  that  with  which  it  is  to  concern  itself.  The  Present,  which
makes up the existential meaning of “getting taken along”, never arrives at
any other ecstatical horizon of its own accord, unless it gets brought back
from  its  lostness  by  a  resolution,  so  that  both  the  current  Situation  and
therewith  the  primordial  ‘limit-Situation’  of  Being-towards-death,  will  be
disclosed as a moment of vision which has been held on to.

(d) The Temporality of Discourse

 

 

xi. Cf. Section 34, H. 160 ff.
 

When  the  “there”  has  been  completely  disclosed,  its  disclosedness  is
this
constituted  by  understanding,  state-of-mind,  and  falling;  and 
disclosedness  becomes  Articulated  by  discourse.  Thus  discourse  does  not
temporalize  itself  primarily  in  any  definite  ecstasis.  Factically,  however,
discourse  expresses  itself  for  the  most  part  in  language,  and  speaks
proximally  in  the  way  of addressing itself to  the  ‘environment’  by talking
about things concernfully; because of this, making-present has, of course, a
privileged constitutive function.

Tenses,  like  the  other  temporal  phenomena  of  language—‘aspects’  and
‘temporal stages’ [“Zeitstufen”]—do not spring from the fact that discourse
expresses itself ‘also’ about ‘temporal’ processes, processes encountered ‘in
time’. Nor does their basis lie in the fact that speaking runs its course ‘in a
psychical  time’.  Discourse  in  itself  is  temporal,  since  all  talking  about…,
of..., or to..., is grounded in the ecstatical unity of temporality. Aspects have
their  roots  in  the  primordial  temporality  of  concern,  whether  or  not  this
concern  relates  itself  to  that  which  is  within  time.  The  problem  of  their
existential-temporal  structure  cannot  even  be  formulated  with  the  help  of
the  ordinary  traditional  conception  of  time,  to  which  the  science  of
language needs must have recourse.(xii) But because in any discourse one
is  talking  about  entities,  even  if  not  primarily  and  predominantly  in  the
sense  of  theoretical  assertion,  the  analysis  of  the  temporal  Constitution  of
discourse  and  the  explication  of  the  temporal  characteristics  of  language-
patterns  can  be  tackled  only  if  the  problem  of  how  Being  and  truth  are
connected  in  principle,  is  broached  in  the  light  of  the  problematic  of
temporality.  We  can  then  define  even  the  ontological  meaning  of  the  ‘is’,
which a superficial theory of propositions and judgments has deformed to a
mere  ‘copula’.  Only  in  terms  of  the  temporality  of  discourse—that  is,  of
Dasein in general—can we clarify how ‘signification’ ‘arises’ and make the
possibility of concept-formation ontologically intelligible.(xiii)

Understanding 

is  grounded  primarily 

the  future  (whether 
temporalize 

in 
in  awaiting).  States-of-mind 

in
themselves
anticipation  or 
primarily  in  having  been  (whether  in  repetition  or  in  having  forgotten).
Falling has its temporal roots primarily in the Present (whether in making-
present or in the moment of vision). All the same, understanding is in every
case a Present which ‘is in the process of having been’. All the same, one’s
state-of-mind temporalizes itself as a future which is ‘making present’. And
all the same, the Present ‘leaps away’ from a future that is in the process of
having been, or else it is held on to by such a future. Thus we can see that in
every  ecstasis,  temporality  temporalizes  itself  as  a  whole;  and  this  means
that  in  the  ecstatical  unity  with  which  temporality  has  fully  temporalized
itself currently, is grounded the totality of the structural whole of existence,
facticity, and falling—that is, the unity of the care-structure.

Temporalizing does not signify that ecstases come in a ‘succession’. The
future is not later than having been, and having been is not earlier than the
Present. Temporality temporalizes itself as a future which makes present in
the process of having been.

Both  the  disclosedness  of  the  “there”  and  Dasein’s  basic  existentiell
possibilities, authenticity and inauthenticity, are founded upon temporality.
But disclosedness always pertains with equal primordiality to the entirety of
Being-in-the-world—to  Being-in  as  well  as  to  the  world.  So  if  we  orient
ourselves  by  the  temporal  Constitution  of  disclosedness,  the  ontological
condition for the possibility that there can be entities which exist as Being-
in-the-world, must be something that may also be exhibited.

69.  The  Temporality  of  Being-in-the-world  and  the  Problem  of  the

Transcendence of the World
 

The ecstatical unity of temporality—that is, the unity of the ‘outside-of-
itself’ in the raptures of the future, of what has been, and of the Present—is
the condition for the possibility that there can be an entity which exists as

‘cleared’.(xiv)  The 

light  which  constitutes 

its  “there”.  The  entity  which  bears  the  title  “Being-there”  is  one  that  has
been 
this  clearedness
[Gelichtetheit]  of  Dasein,  is  not  something  ontically  present-at-hand  as  a
power or source for a radiant brightness occurring in the entity on occasion.
That by which this entity is essentially cleared—in other words, that which
makes  it  both  ‘open’  for  itself  and  ‘bright’  for  itself—is  what  we  have
defined  as  “care”,  in  advance  of  any  ‘temporal’  Interpretation.  In  care  is
grounded the full disclosedness of the “there”. Only by this clearedness is
any  illuminating  or  illumining,  any  awareness,  ‘seeing’,  or  having  of
something, made possible. We understand the light of this clearedness only
if we are not seeking some power implanted in us and present-at-hand, but
are interrogating the whole constitution of Dasein’s-Being—namely, care—
and are interrogating it as to the unitary basis for its existential possibility.
Ecstatical temporality clears the “there” primordially. It is what primarily
regulates the possible unity of all Dasein’s existential structures.
 

xiv. Cf. Section 28, H. 133.

H. 351

 

Only  through  the  fact  that  Being-there  is  rooted  in  temporality  can  we
get an insight into the existential possibility of that phenomenon  which, at
the  beginning  of  our  analytic  of  Dasein,  we  have  designated  as  its  basic
state: Being-in-the-world. We had to assure ourselves in the beginning that
the structural unity of this phenomenon cannot be torn apart. The question
of  the  basis  which  makes  the  unity  of  this  articulated  structure  possible,
remained  in  the  background.  With  the  aim  of  protecting  this  phenomenon
from  those  tendencies  to  split  it  up  which  were  the  most  obvious  and
therefore the most baleful, we gave a rather thorough Interpretation of that
everyday  mode  of  Being-in-the-world  which  is  closest  to  us—concernful
Being  alongside  the  ready-to-hand  within-the-world.  Now  that  care  itself
has  been  defined  ontologically  and  traced  back  to  temporality  as  its
existential  ground, concern can in  turn  be conceived explicitly  in  terms  of
either care or temporality.

In the first instance our analysis of the temporality of concern sticks to
the  mode  of  having  to  do  with  the  ready-to-hand  circumspectively.  Our
that
analysis 

existential-temporal 

possibility 

pursues 

then 

the 

circumspective  concern  may  be  modified  into  a  discovering  of  entities
within-the-world  in  the  sense  of certain possibilities of scientific research,
and discovering them ‘merely’ by looking at them. Our Interpretation of the
temporality  of  Being  alongside  what  is  ready-to-hand  and  present-at-hand
within-the-world—Being  alongside  circumspectively  as  well  as  with
theoretical  concern—shows  us  at  the  same  time  how  this  temporality  is
already the  advance  condition  for  that possibility of Being-in-the-world  in
which Being alongside entities within-the-world is grounded. If we take the
temporal Constitution of Being-in-the-world as a theme for analysis, we are
led to the following questions: in what way is anything like a world possible
at all? in what sense is the world? what does the world transcend, and how
does  it  do  so?  how  are  ‘independent’  [“unabhängige”]  entities  within-the-
world  ‘connected’  [“hängt”...  “zusammen”]  with  the  transcending  world?
To  expound  these  questions  ontologically  is  not  to  answer  them.  On  the
contrary, what such an exposition accomplishes is the clarification of those
structures with regard to which the problem of transcendence must be raised
—a clarification which is necessary beforehand. In the existential-temporal
Interpretation of Being-in-the-world, three things will be considered: (a) the
temporality  of  circumspective  concern;  (b)  the  temporal  meaning  of  the
way  in  which  circumspective  concern  becomes  modified  into  theoretical
knowledge  of  what  is  present-at-hand  within-the-world;  (c)  the  temporal
problem of the transcendence of the world.

(a) The Temporality of Circumspective Concern

 

 

H. 352

How  are  we  to  obtain  the  right  point  of  view  for  analysing  the
temporality  of  concern?  We  have  called  concernful  Being  alongside  the
‘world’  our  “dealings  in  and  with  the  environment”.(xv)  As  phenomena
which  are  examples  of  Being  alongside,  we  have  chosen  the  using,
manipulation,  and  producing  of  the  ready-to-hand,  and  the  deficient  and
undifferentiated  modes  of  these;  that  is,  we  have  chosen  ways  of  Being
alongside  what  belongs  to  one’s  everyday  needs.(xvi)  In  this  kind  of
concern  Dasein’s  authentic  existence  too  maintains  itself,  even  when  for
such existence this concern is ‘a matter of indifference’. The ready-to-hand

things with which we concern ourselves are not the causes of our concern,
as if this were to arise only by the effects of entities within-the-world. Being
alongside  the  ready-to-hand  cannot  be  explained  ontically  in  terms  of  the
ready-to-hand itself, nor can the ready-to-hand be derived contrariwise from
this  kind  of  Being.  But  neither  are  concern,  as  a  kind  of  Being  which
belongs to Dasein, and that with which we concern ourselves, as something
ready-to-hand  within-the-world,  just  present-at-hand  together.  All  the
same,  a  ‘connection’  subsists  between  them.  That  which  is  dealt  with,  if
rightly  understood,  sheds  light  upon  concernful  dealings  themselves.  And
furthermore, if we miss the phenomenal structure of what is dealt with, then
we  fail  to  recognize  the  existential  constitution  of  dealing.  Of  course  we
have already made an essential gain for the analysis of those entities which
we encounter as closest to us, if their specific character as equipment does
not  get  passed  over.  But  we  must  understand  further  that  concernful
dealings never dwell with any individual item of equipment. Our using and
manipulating  of  any  definite  item  of  equipment  still  remains  oriented
towards  some  equipmental  context.  If,  for  instance,  we  are  searching  for
some equipment which we have ‘misplaced’, then what we have in mind is
not  merely  what  we  are  searching  for,  or  even  primarily  this;  nor  do  we
have it in mind in an isolated ‘act’; but the range of the equipmental totality
has  already  been  discovered  beforehand.  Whenever  we  ‘go  to  work’  and
seize hold of something, we do not push out from the “nothing” and come
upon some item of equipment which has been presented to us in isolation;
in laying hold of an item of equipment, we come back to it from whatever
work-world has already been disclosed.
 

xv. Cf. Section 15, H. 66 ff.
xvi. Cf. Section 12, H. 56 ff.

H. 353

 

The  upshot  of  this  is  that  if  in  our  analysis  of  dealings  we  aim  at  that
which  is  dealt  with,  then  one’s  existent  Being  alongside  the  entities  with
which one concerns oneself must be given an orientation not towards some
isolated  item  of  equipment  which  is  ready-to-hand,  but  towards  the
equipmental totality. This way of taking what is dealt with, is forced upon
us also if we consider that character of Being which belongs distinctively to

is 

that 

involvement.(xvii)  We
ready-to-hand—namely, 
equipment 
understand the term “involvement” ontologically. The kind of talk in which
we  say  that  something  has  with  it  an  involvement  in  something,  is  not
meant to establish a fact ontically, but rather to indicate the kind of Being
that  belongs  to  what  is  ready-to-hand.  The  relational  character  of
involvement—of  its  ‘with...  in...’—suggests  that  “an”  equipment  is
ontologically  impossible.  Of  course  just  a  solitary  item  of  equipment  may
be ready-to-hand while another is missing. But this makes known to us that
the  very  thing  that  is  ready-to-hand  belongs  to  something  else.  Our
concernful  dealings  can 
is  ready-to-hand  be  encountered
circumspectively only if in these dealings we already understand something
like  the  involvement  which  something  has  in  something.  The  Being-
alongside which discovers circumspectively in concern, amounts to letting
something  be 
involvement
is, 
understandingly.  Letting  things  be  involved  makes  up  the  existential
structure  of  concern.  But  concern,  as  Being  alongside  something,  belongs
to  the  essential  constitution  of  care;  and  care,  in  turn,  is  grounded  in
temporality. If all this is so, then the existential condition of the possibility
of letting things be involved must be sought in a mode of the temporalizing
of temporality.

involved—that 

let  what 

Letting something be involved is implied in the simplest handling of an
item  of  equipment.  That  which  we  let  it  be  involved    i  n    [Das  Wobei
desselben] has the character of a “towards-which”; with regard to this, the
equipment  is  either  usable  or  in  use.  The  understanding  of  the  “towards-
which”—that is, the understanding of what the equipment is involved in—
has  the  temporal  structure  of  awaiting.  In  awaiting  the  “towards-which”,
concern  can  at  the  same  time  come  back  by  itself  to  the  sort  of  thing  in
which it is involved. The awaiting of what it is involved in, and—together
with  this  awaiting—the  retaining  of  that  which  is  thus  involved,  make
possible  in  its  ecstatical  unity  the  specifically  manipulative  way  in  which
equipment is made present.(1)

The  awaiting  of  the  “towards-which”  is  neither  a  considering  of  the
‘goal’  nor  an  expectation  of  the  impendent  finishing  of  the  work  to  be
produced.  It  has  by  no  means  the  character  of  getting  something
thematically into one’s grasp. Neither does the retaining of that which has
an  involvement  signify  holding  it  fast  thematically.  Manipulative  dealings
no  more  relate  themselves  merely  to  that  in  which  we  let  something  be
involved,  than  they  do  to  what  is  involved  itself.  Letting  something  be
involved is constituted rather in the unity of a retention which awaits, and it
is  constituted  in  such  a  manner,  indeed,  that  the  making-present  which
arises from this, makes possible the characteristic absorption of concern in
its  equipmental  world.  When  one  is  wholly  devoted  to  something  and
‘really’  busies  oneself  with  it,  one  does  not  do  so  just  alongside  the  work
itself, or alongside the tool, or alongside both of them ‘together’. The unity
of  the  relations  in  which  concern  circumspectively  ‘operates’,  has  been
established  already  by  letting-things-be-involved—which  is  based  upon
temporality.

A  specific  kind  of  forgetting  is  essential  for  the  temporality  that  is
constitutive for letting something be involved. The Self must forget itself if,
lost in the world of equipment, it is to be able ‘actually’ to go to work and
manipulate  something.  But  all  the  same,  inasmuch  as  an  awaiting  always
leads  the  way  in  the  unity  of  the  temporalizing  of  concern,  concernful
Dasein’s  own  potentiality-for-Being  has,  as  we  shall  show,  been  given  a
position in care.(1)
 

1. ‘…in die Sorge gestellt.’

The  making-present  which  awaits  and  retains,  is  constitutive  for  that
familiarity  in  accordance  with  which  Dasein,  as  Being-with-one-another,
‘knows its way about’ [sich “auskennt”] in its public environment. Letting
things  be  involved  is  something  which  we  understand  existentially  as  a
letting-them-‘be’  [ein  “Sein”-lassen].  On  such  a  basis  circumspection  can
encounter the ready-to-hand as that entity which it is. Hence we can further
elucidate  the  temporality  of  concern  by  giving  heed  to  those  modes  of
circumspectively 
letting  something  be  encountered  which  we  have
characterized  above(xviii)  as  “conspicuousness”,  “obtrusiveness”,  and
“obstinacy”.  Thematical  perception  of  Things  is  precisely  not  the  way

equipment  ready-to-hand  is  encountered  in  its  ‘true  “in-itself”  ’;  it  is
encountered  rather  in  the  inconspicuousness  of  what  we  can  come  across
‘obviously’ and ‘Objectively’. But if there is something conspicuous in the
totality of such entities, this implies that the equipmental totality as such is
obtruding itself along with it. What sort of existential structure must belong
to  letting  things  be  involved,  if  such  a  procedure  can  let  something  be
encountered  as  conspicuous?  This  question  is  now  aimed  not  at  those
factical occasions which turn our attention to something already presented,
but rather at the ontological meaning of the fact that it can thus be turned.
 

xviii. Cf. Section 16, H. 72 ff.

H. 355

 

When  something  cannot  be  used—when,  for  instance,  a  tool  definitely
refuses  to  work—it  can  be  conspicuous  only  in  and  for  dealings  in  which
something  is  manipulated.  Even  by  the  sharpest  and  most  persevering(1)
‘perception’  and  ‘representation’  of  Things,  one  can  never  discover
anything  like  the  damaging  of  a  tool.  If  we  are  to  encounter  anything
unmanageable, the handling must be of such a sort that it can be disturbed.
But what does this signify ontologically? The making-present which awaits
and  retains,  gets  held  up  with  regard  to  its  absorption  in  relationships  of
involvement,  and  it  gets  held  up  by  what  will  exhibit  itself  afterwards  as
damage. The making-present, which awaits the “towards-which” with equal
primordiality, is held fast alongside the equipment which has been used, and
it  is  held  fast  in  such  a  manner,  indeed,  that  the  “towards-which”  and  the
“in-order-to” are now encountered explicitly for the first time. On the other
hand,  the  only  way  in  which  the  making-present  itself  can  meet  up  with
anything  unsuitable,  is  by  already  operating  in  such  a  way  as  to  retain
awaitingly  that  which  has  an  involvement  in  something.  To  say  that
making-present  gets  ‘held  up’  is  to  say  that  in  its  unity  with  the  awaiting
which  retains,  it  diverts  itself  into  itself  more  and  more,  and  is  thus
constitutive for the ‘inspecting’ [“Nachsehen”], testing, and eliminating of
the  disturbance.  If  concernful  dealings  were  merely  a  sequence  of
‘Experiences’  running  their  course  ‘in  time’,  however  intimately  these
might  be  ‘associated’,  it  would  still  be  ontologically  impossible  to  let  any
conspicuous  unusable  equipment  be  encountered.  Letting  something  be

involved must, as such, be grounded in the ecstatical unity of the making-
present  which  awaits  and  retains,  whatever  we  have  made  accessible  in
dealing with contexts of equipment.(2)
 

1.  ‘anhaltendste’.  This  is  the  first  of  several  compounds  of  the  verb  ‘halten’  (‘to  hold’)  which
appear in this and the following paragraphs. Others are ‘behalten’ (‘retain’ in the sense of holding in
one’s  memory),  ‘aufhalten’  (‘hold  up’  in  the  sense  of  delaying  or  bringing  to  a  halt),  ‘festhalten’
(‘hold fast’).

2.  ‘Das  Bewendenlassen  muss  als  solches,  was  immer  es  auch  an  Zeugzusammenhängen
in  der  ekstatischen  Einheit  des  gewärtigen-behaltenden

umgänglich  zugänglich  macht, 
Gegenwärtigens gründen.’

And how is it possible to ‘ascertain’ what is missing [Fehlendem]—that
is  to  say,  un-ready-to-hand,  not  just  ready-to-hand  in  an  unmanageable
way? That which is un-ready-to-hand is discovered circumspectively when
we miss it [im Vermissen]. The ‘affirmation’ that something is not present-
at-hand,  is  founded  upon  our  missing  it;  and  both  our  missing  it  and  our
affirmation have their  own existential  presuppositions.  Such  missing is  by
no  means  a  not-making-present  [Nichtgegenwärtigen];  it  is  rather  a
deficient  mode  of  the  Present  in  the  sense  of  the  making-unpresent
[Ungegenwärtigens] of something which one has expected or which one has
always had at one’s disposal. If, when one circumspectively lets something
be  involved,  one  were  not  ‘from  the  outset’  awaiting  the  object  of  one’s
concern,  and  if  such  awaiting  did  not  temporalize  itself  in  a  unity  with  a
making-present,  then  Dasein  could  never  ‘find’  that  something  is  missing
[fehlt].

On the other hand, when one is making present something ready-to-hand
by awaiting, the possibility of one’s getting surprised by something is based
upon one’s not awaiting something else which stands in a possible context
of  involvement  with  what  one  awaits.  In  the  not  awaiting  of  the  making-
present which is lost, the ‘horizonal’ leeway within which one’s Dasein can
be assailed by something surprising is first disclosed.

H. 356

 

That  with  which  one’s  concernful  dealings  fail  to  cope,  either  by
producing or procuring something, or even by turning away, holding aloof,
or protecting oneself from something, reveals itself in its insurmountability.
Concern resigns itself to it.(1) But resigning oneself to something is a mode

peculiar to circumspectively letting it be encountered. On the basis of this
kind  of  discovery  concern  can  come  across  that  which  is  inconvenient,
disturbing, hindering, endangering, or in general resistant in some way. The
temporal structure of resigning oneself to something, lies in a non-retaining
which  awaitingly  makes  present.  In  awaitingly  making  present,  one  does
not,  for  instance,  reckon  ‘on’  that  which  is  unsuitable  but  none  the  less
available. “Not reckoning with” something, is a mode of “taking into one’s
reckoning”  that  which  one  cannot  cling  to.  That  which  one  has  “not
reckoned  with”  does  not  get  forgotten;  it  gets  retained,  so  that  in  its  very
unsuitability  it  remains  ready-to-hand.(2)  That  which  is  ready-to-hand  in
this  manner  belongs  to  the  everyday  stock  or  content  of  the  factically
disclosed environment.
 

1. ‘Das Besorgen findet sich damit ab.’
2.  ‘Die  zeitliche  Struktur  des  Sichabfindens  liegt  in  einem  gewärtigend-gegenwärtigenden
Unbehalten.  Das  gewärtigende  Gegenwärtigen  rechnet  zum  Beispiel  nicht  “auf”  das  Ungeeignete,
aber  gleichwohl  Verfügbare.  Das  Nichtrechnen  mit...  ist  ein  Modus  des  Rechnungtragens  dem
gegenüber, woran man sich nicht halten kann. Es wird nicht vergessen, sondern behalten, so dass es
gerade in seiner Ungeeignetheit zuhanden bleibt.’

Only in so far as something resistant has been discovered on the basis of
the  ecstatical  temporality  of  concern,  can  factical  Dasein  understand  itself
in its abandonment to a ‘world’ of which it never becomes master. Even if
concern  remains  restricted  to  the  urgency  of  everyday  needs,  it  is  never  a
pure making-present, but arises from a retention which awaits; on the basis
of such a retention, or as such a ‘basis’, Dasein exists in a world. Thus in a
certain manner, factically existent Dasein always knows its way about, even
in a ‘world’ which is alien.

When, in one’s concern, one lets something be involved, one’s doing so
is founded on temporality, and amounts to an altogether pre-ontological and
non-thematic way  of understanding  involvement  and readiness-to-hand. In
what  follows,  it  will  be  shown  to  what  extent  the  understanding  of  these
types of Being as such is, in the end, also founded on temporality. We must
first give a more concrete demonstration of the temporality of Being-in-the-
world.  With  this  as  our  aim,  we  shall  trace  how  the  theoretical  attitude
towards the ‘world’ ‘arises’ out of circumspective concern with the ready-
to-hand.  Not  only  the  circumspective  discovering  of  entities  within-the-
world but also the theoretical discovering of them is founded upon Being-
in-the-world.  The  existential-temporal  Interpretation  of  these  ways  of

discovering  is  preparatory  to  the  temporal  characterization  of  this  basic
state of Dasein.

(b)  The  Temporal  Meaning  of  the  Way  in  which  Circumspective
Concern becomes Modified into the Theoretical Discovery of the Present-
at-hand Within-the-world
 

H. 357

 

When  in  the  course  of  existential  ontological  analysis  we  ask  how
theoretical  discovery  ‘arises’  out  of  circumspective  concern,  this  implies
already  that  we  are  not  making  a  problem  of  the  ontical  history  and
development  of  science,  or  of  the  factical  occasions  for  it,  or  of  its
proximate  goals.  In  seeking  the  ontological  genesis  of  the  theoretical
attitude, we are asking which of those conditions implied in Dasein’s state
of Being are existentially necessary for the possibility of Dasein’s existing
in the way of scientific research. This formulation of the question is aimed
at an existential conception of science. This must be distinguished from the
‘logical’  conception  which  understands  science  with  regard  to  its  results
and  defines  it  as  ‘something  established  on  an  interconnection  of  true
propositions—that  is,  propositions  counted  as  valid’.  The  existential
conception understands science as a way of existence and thus as a mode of
Being-in-the-world,  which  discovers  or  discloses  either  entities  or  Being.
Yet  a  fully  adequate  existential  Interpretation  of  science  cannot  be  carried
out  until  the  meaning  of  Being  and  the  ‘connection’  between  Being  and
truth(xix) have  been  clarified  in  terms  of  the  temporality  of  existence.(1)
The  following  deliberations  are  preparatory  to  the  understanding  of  this
central  problematic,  within  which,  moreover,  the  idea  of  phenomenology,
as distinguished from the preliminary conception of it which we indicated
by way of introduction(xx) will be developed for the first time.

1. The italics in this and the following sentence appear only in the later editions.

Corresponding to the stage of our study at which we have now arrived, a
further restriction will be imposed upon our Interpretation of the theoretical
attitude. We shall investigate only the way in which circumspective concern
with the ready-to-hand changes over into an exploration of what we come
across as present-at-hand  within-the-world; and we  shall  be guided  by the
aim  of  penetrating  to  the  temporal  Constitution  of  Being-in-the-world  in
general.

H. 358

 

In characterizing the  change-over from the  manipulating and using  and
so  forth  which  are  circumspective  in  a  ‘practical’  way,  to  ‘theoretical’
exploration,  it  would  be  easy  to  suggest  that  merely  looking  at  entities  is
something  which  emerges  when  concern  holds  back  from  any  kind  of
manipulation. What is decisive in the ‘emergence’ of the theoretical attitude
would  then  lie  in  the  disappearance of praxis.  So  if  one  posits  ‘practical’
concern  as  the  primary  and  predominant  kind  of  Being  which  factical
Dasein possesses, the ontological possibility of ‘theory’ will be due to the
absence  of  praxis—that  is,  to  a  privation.  But  the  discontinuance  of  a
specific manipulation in our concernful dealings does not simply leave the
guiding  circumspection  behind  as  a  remainder.  Rather,  our  concern  then
diverts itself specifically into a just-looking-around [ein Nur-sich-umsehen].
But  this  is  by  no  means  the  way  in  which  the  ‘theoretical’  attitude  of
science is reached. On the contrary, the tarrying which is discontinued when
one  manipulates,  can  take  on  the  character  of  a  more  precise  kind  of
circumspection,  such  as  ‘inspecting’,  checking  up  on  what  has  been
attained,  or  looking  over  the  ‘operations’  [“Betrieb”]  which  are  now  ‘at  a
standstill’.  Holding  back  from  the  use  of  equipment  is  so  far  from  sheer
‘theory’  that  the  kind  of  circumspection  which  tarries  and  ‘considers’,
remains wholly in the grip of the ready-to-hand equipment with which one
is concerned. ‘Practical’ dealings have their own ways of tarrying. And just
as praxis has its own specific kind of sight (‘theory’), theoretical research is
not without a praxis of its own. Reading off the measurements which result
from an experiment often requires a complicated ‘technical’ set-up for the
experimental design. Observation with a microscope is dependent upon the
production  of  ‘preparations’.  Archaeological  excavation,  which  precedes
any Interpretation of the ‘findings’, demands manipulations of the grossest

kind.  But  even  in  the  ‘most  abstract’  way  of  working  out  problems  and
establishing  what  has  been  obtained,  one  manipulates  equipment  for
writing,  for  example.  However  ‘uninteresting’  and  ‘obvious’  such
components of scientific research may be, they are by no means a matter of
indifference ontologically. The explicit suggestion that scientific behaviour
as  a  way  of  Being-in-the-world,  is  not  just  a  ‘purely  intellectual  activity’,
may seem petty and superfluous. If only it were not plain from this triviality
that  it  is  by  no  means  patent  where  the  ontological  boundary  between
‘theoretical’ and ‘atheoretical’ behaviour really runs!

Someone will hold that all manipulation in the sciences is merely in the
service  of  pure  observation—the  investigative  discovery  and  disclosure  of
the  ‘things  themselves’.  ‘Seeing’,  taken  in  the  widest  sense,  regulates  all
‘procedures’  and  retains  its  priority.  ‘To  whatever  kind  of  objects  one’s
knowledge may relate itself, and by whatever means it may do so, still that
through which it relates itself to them immediately, and which all thinking
as a means has as its goal (author’s italics) is intuition.(xxi) The idea of the
intuitus has guided all Interpretation of knowledge from the beginnings of
Greek  ontology  until  today,  whether  or  not  that  intuitus  can  be  factically
reached. If we are to exhibit the existential genesis of science in accordance
with  the  priority  of  ‘seeing’,  we  must  set  out  by  characterizing  the
circumspection which is the guide for ‘practical’ concern.

H. 359

 

Circumspection operates in the involvement-relationships of the context
of  equipment  which  is  ready-to-hand.  Moreover,  it  is  subordinate  to  the
guidance of a more or less explicit survey of the equipmental totality of the
current equipment-world and of the public environment which belongs to it.
This  survey  is  not  just  one  in  which  things  that  are  present-at-hand  are
subsequently scraped together. What is essential to it is that one should have
a  primary  understanding  of  the  totality  of  involvements  within  which
factical  concern  always  takes  its  start.  Such  a  survey  illumines  one’s
concern, and receives its ‘light’ from that potentiality-for-Being on the part
of  Dasein  for  the  sake  of  which  concern  exists  as  care.  In  one’s  current
using  and  manipulating,  the  concernful  circumspection  which  does  this

‘surveying’,  brings  the  ready-to-hand  closer  to  Dasein,  and  does  so  by
interpreting what has been sighted. This specific way of bringing the object
of concern close by interpreting it circumspectively, we call “deliberating”
[Überlegung]. The scheme peculiar to this is the ‘if—then’; if this or that,
for instance, is to be produced, put to use, or averted, then some ways and
means,  circumstances,  or  opportunities  will  be  needed.  Circumspective
deliberation illumines Dasein’s current factical situation in the environment
with  which it concerns itself. Accordingly,  such deliberation never  merely
‘affirms’  that  some  entity  is  present-at-hand  or  has  such  and  such
properties. Moreover, deliberation can be performed even when that which
is  brought  close  in  it  circumspectively  is  not  palpably  ready-to-hand  and
does not have presence within the closest range. Bringing the environment
closer  in  circumspective  deliberation  has  the  existential  meaning  of  a
making  present;  for  envisaging(1)  is  only  a  mode  of  this.  In  envisaging,
one’s deliberation catches sight directly of that which is needed but which is
un-ready-to-hand. Circumspection which envisages does not relate itself to
‘mere representations’.
 

1. ‘Here the familiar noun ‘Vergegenwärtigung’ (‘envisaging’) is printed with the first syllable in
italics  to draw  attention  to its connection with the special phenomenological verb ‘Gegenwärtigen’
(‘making present’).

H. 360

 

Circumspective  making-present,  however,  is  a  phenomenon  with  more
than one kind of foundation. In the first instance, it always belongs to a full
ecstatical unity of temporality. It is grounded in a retention of that context
of  equipment  with  which  Dasein  concerns  itself  in  awaiting  a  possibility.
That which has already been laid open in awaiting and retaining is brought
closer  by  one’s  deliberative  making-present  or  envisaging.(1)  But  if
deliberation is to be able to operate in the scheme of the ‘if—then’, concern
must  already  have  ‘surveyed’  a  context  of  involvements  and  have  an
understanding of it. That which is considered with an ‘if’ must already be
understood  as  something  or  other.  This  does  not  require  that  the
understanding  of  equipment  be  expressed  in  a  predication.  The  schema
‘something as something’ has already been sketched out beforehand in the
structure  of  one’s  pre-predicative  understanding.  The  as-structure  is
grounded  ontologically  in  the  temporality  of  understanding.  But  on  the

other  hand,  only  to  the  extent  that  Dasein,  in  awaiting  some  possibility
(here  this  means  a  “towards-which”),  has  come  back  to  a  “towards-this”
(that is to say that it retains something ready-to-hand)—only to this extent
can the  making-present which belongs to  this awaiting  and retaining, start
with  what  is  thus  retained,  and  bring  it,  in  its  character  of  having  been
assigned  or  referred  to  its  “towards-which”,  explicitly  closer.  The
deliberation which brings it close must, in the schema of making present, be
in conformity with the kind of Being that belongs to what is to be brought
close.  The  involvement-character  of  the  ready-to-hand  does  not  first  get
discovered  by  deliberation,  but  only  gets  brought  close  by  it  in  such  a
manner  as  to  let  that  in  which  something  has  an  involvement,  be  seen
circumspectively as this very thing.
 

1. 

‘Das 

im  gewärtigenden  Behalten  schon  Aufgeschlossene  bringt  die  überlegende

Gegenwärtigung bzw. Vergegenwärtigung näher.’

The  way  the  Present  is  rooted  in  the  future  and  in  having  been,  is  the
existential-temporal  condition  for  the  possibility  that  what  has  been
projected  in  circumspective  understanding  can  be  brought  closer  in  a
making-present, and in such a way that the Present can thus conform itself
to  what  is  encountered  within  the  horizon  of  awaiting  and  retaining;  this
means that it must interpret itself in the schema of the as-structure. We have
thus answered the question we formulated earlier—the question of whether
the  as-structure  has  some  existential-ontological  connection  with  the
phenomenon  of  projection.(xxii)  Like  understanding  and  interpretation  in
general, the ‘as’ is grounded in the ecstatico-horizonal unity of temporality.
In our fundamental analysis of Being, and of course in connection with the
Interpretation  of  the  ‘is’  (which,  as  a  copula,  gives  ‘expression’  to  the
addressing  of  something  as  something),  we  must  again  make  the
phenomenon  of  the  “as”  a  theme  and  delimit  the  conception  of  this
‘schema’ existentially.

The  question  of  the  genesis  of  theoretical  behaviour  is  one  which  we
have left hanging. What can a temporal characterization of circumspective
deliberation  and  its  schemata  contribute  to  the  answering  of  it?  Only  that
this elucidates the Situation in which circumspective concern changes over
into  theoretical  discovering—a  Situation  of  the  kind  which  belongs  to
Dasein. We may then try to analyse this change-over itself by taking as our

clue  an  elementary  assertion  which  is  circumspectively  deliberative  in
character and the modifications which are possible for it.
 

xxii. Cf. Section 32, H. 151.

H. 361

 

When we are using a tool circumspectively, we can say, for instance, that
the hammer is too heavy or too light. Even the proposition that the hammer
is  heavy can give  expression to  a concernful  deliberation, and signify  that
the hammer is not an easy one—in other words, that it takes force to handle
it,  or  that  it  will  be  hard  to  manipulate.(1)  But  this  proposition  can  also
mean that the entity before us, which we already know circumspectively as
a hammer, has a weight—that is to say, it has the ‘property’ of heaviness: it
exerts  a  pressure  on  what  lies  beneath  it,  and  it  falls  if  this  is  removed.
When  this  kind  of  talk  is  so  understood,  it  is  no  longer  spoken  within  the
horizon  of  awaiting  and  retaining  an  equipmental  totality  and  its
involvement-relationships.  What  is  said  has  been  drawn  from  looking  at
what is suitable for an entity with ‘mass’. We have now sighted something
that  is  suitable  for  the  hammer,  not  as  a  tool,  but  as  a  corporeal  Thing
subject to the law of gravity. To talk circumspectively of ‘too heavy’ or ‘too
light’ no longer has any ‘meaning’; that is to say, the entity in itself, as we
now  encounter  it,  gives  us  nothing  with  relation  to  which  it  could  be
‘found’ too heavy or too light.
 

1. ‘Auch der Satz: der Hammer ist schwer, kann einer besorgenden Überlegung Ausdruck geben
und  bedeuten:  er  ist  nicht  leicht,  das  heisst,  er  fordert  zur  Handhabung  Kraft,  bzw.  er  wird  die
Hantierung  erschweren.’  Here  Heidegger  is  exploiting  the  double  meaning  of  the  German  pair  of
adjectives, ‘schwer’ and ‘leicht’, which may correspond either to the English pair ‘heavy’ and ‘light’,
or to the pair ‘difficult’ and ‘easy’.

Why  is  it  that  what  we  are  talking  about—the  heavy  hammer—shows
itself differently when our way of talking is thus modified? Not because we
are  keeping  our  distance  from  manipulation,  nor  because  we  are  just
looking away  [absehen]  from  the  equipmental  character  of  this  entity,  but
rather because we  are  looking at  [ansehen]  the  ready-to-hand  thing which
we  encounter,  and  looking  at  it  ‘in  a  new  way’  as  something  present-at-
hand. The  understanding  of  Being  by  which  our  concernful  dealings  with

entities  within-the-world  have  been  guided  has  changed  over.  But  if,
instead of deliberating circumspectively about something ready-to-hand, we
‘take’  it  as  something  present-at-hand,  has  a  scientific  attitude  thus
constituted itself? Moreover, even that which is ready-to-hand can be made
a  theme  for  scientific  investigation  and  determination,  for  instance  when
one  studies  someone’s  environment—his  milieu—in  the  context  of  a
historiological biography. The context of equipment that is ready-to-hand in
an everyday manner, its historical emergence and utilization, and its factical
role  in  Dasein—all  these  are  objects  for  the  science  of  economics.  The
ready-to-hand can become the ‘Object’ of a science without having to lose
its  character  as  equipment.  A  modification  of  our  understanding  of  Being
does  not  seem  to  be  necessarily  constitutive  for  the  genesis  of  the
theoretical attitude ‘towards Things’. Certainly not, if this “modification” is
to imply a change in the kind of Being which, in understanding the entity
before us, we understand it to possess.

H. 362

 

In  our  first  description  of  the  genesis  of  the  theoretical  attitude  out  of
circumspection, we have made basic a way of theoretically grasping entities
within-the-world—physical  Nature—in  which  the  modification  of  our
understanding  of  Being  is  tantamount  to  a  change-over.  In  the  ‘physical’
assertion that ‘the hammer is heavy’ we overlook not only the tool-character
of the entity we encounter, but also something that belongs to any ready-to-
hand equipment: its place. Its place becomes a matter of indifference. This
does  not  mean  that  what  is  present-at-hand  loses  its  ‘location’  altogether.
But its place becomes a spatio-temporal position, a ‘world-point’, which is
in  no  way  distinguished  from  any  other.  This  implies  not  only  that  the
multiplicity of places of equipment ready-to-hand within the confines of the
environment becomes modified to a pure multiplicity of positions, but that
the  entities  of  the  environment  are  altogether  released  from  such
confinement  [entschränkt].  The  aggregate  of  the  present-at-hand  becomes
the theme.
In 

the  releasing  from  such  environmental
confinement  belongs  to  the  way  one’s  understanding  of  Being  has  been
modified; and it becomes at the same time a delimitation of the ‘realm’ of
the
the  present-at-hand, 

takes  as  one’s  guiding  clue 

the  case  before  us, 

if  one  now 

understanding  of  Being  in  the  sense  of  presence-at-hand.  The  more
appropriately  the  Being  of  the  entities  to  be  explored  is  understood  under
the  guidance  of  an  understanding  of  Being,  and  the  more  the  totality  of
entities  has  been  Articulated  in  its  basic  attributes  as  a  possible  area  of
subject-matter for a science, all the more secure will be the perspective for
one’s methodical inquiry.

The  classical  example  for  the  historical  development  of  a  science  and
even for its ontological genesis, is the rise of mathematical physics. What is
decisive  for  its  development  does  not  lie  in  its  rather  high  esteem  for  the
observation of ‘facts’, nor in its ‘application’ of mathematics in determining
the character of natural processes; it lies rather in the way in which Nature
herself is mathematically projected. In this projection something constantly
present-at-hand  (matter)  is  uncovered  beforehand,  and  the  horizon  is
opened so that one may be guided by looking at those constitutive items in
it which are quantitatively determinable (motion, force, location, and time).
Only ‘in the light’ of a Nature which has been projected in this fashion can
anything like a ‘fact’ be found and set up for an experiment regulated and
delimited  in  terms  of  this  projection.  The  ‘grounding’  of  ‘factual  science’
was possible only because the researchers understood that in principle there
are  no  ‘bare  facts’.  In  the  mathematical  projection  of  Nature,  moreover,
what is decisive is not primarily the mathematical as such; what is decisive
is  that  this  projection  discloses  something  that  is    a  p  r  i  o  r  i. Thus  the
paradigmatic  character  of  mathematical  natural  science  does  not  lie  in  its
exactitude or in the fact that it is binding for ‘Every-man’; it consists rather
in the fact that the entities which it takes as its theme are discovered in it in
the only way in which entities can be discovered—by the prior projection of
their state of Being. When the basic concepts of that understanding of Being
by which we are guided have been worked out, the clues of its methods, the
structure  of  its  way  of  conceiving  things,  the  possibility  of  truth  and
certainty  which  belongs  to  it,  the  ways  in  which  things  get  grounded  or
proved,  the  mode  in  which  it  is  binding  for  us,  and  the  way  it  is
communicated—all  these  will  be  Determined.  The  totality  of  these  items
constitutes the full existential conception of science.

H. 363

 

The  scientific  projection  of  any  entities  which  we  have  somehow
encountered already lets their kind of Being be understood explicitly and in
such a manner that it thus becomes manifest what ways are possible for the
pure  discovery  of  entities  within-the-world.  The  Articulation  of  the
understanding  of  Being,  the  delimitation  of  an  area  of  subject-matter  (a
delimitation  guided  by  this  understanding),  and  the  sketching-out  of  the
way of conceiving which is appropriate to such entities—all these belong to
the totality of this projecting; and this totality is what we call “thematizing”.
Its  aim  is  to  free  the  entities  we  encounter  within-the-world,  and  to  free
them  in  such  a  way  that  they  can  ‘throw  themselves  against’(1)  a  pure
discovering—that  is,  that  they  can  become  “Objects”.  Thematizing
Objectifies. It does not first ‘posit’ the entities, but frees them so that one
can  interrogate  them  and  determine  their  character  ‘Objectively’.  Being
which  Objectifies  and  which  is  alongside  the  present-at-hand  within-the-
world, is  characterized by a distinctive  kind  of  making-present.(xxiii) This
making-present is distinguished from the Present of circumspection in that
—above  all—the  kind  of  discovering  which  belongs  to  the  science  in
question  awaits  solely  the  discoveredness  of  the  present-at-hand.  This
awaiting  of  discoveredness  has  its  existentiell  basis  in  a  resoluteness  by
which Dasein projects itself towards its potentiality-for-Being in the ‘truth’.
This  projection  is  possible  because  Being-in-the-truth  makes  up  a  definite
way in which Dasein may exist. We shall not trace further how science has
its source in authentic existence. It is enough now if we understand that the
thematizing of entities within-the-world presupposes Being-in-the-world as
the basic state of Dasein, and if we understand how it does so.
 

xxiii.  The  thesis  that  all  cognition  has  ‘intuition’  as  its  goal,  has  the  temporal  meaning  that  all
cognizing  is  making  present.  Whether  every  science,  or  even  philosophical  cognition,  aims  at  a
making-present, need not be decided here.

Husserl uses the expression ‘make present’ in characterizing sensory perception. Cf. his Logische
Untersuchungen, first edition, 1901, vol. II, pp. 588 and 620. This ‘temporal’ way of describing this
phenomenon must have been suggested by the analysis of perception and intuition in general in terms
of  the  idea  of  intention. That  the  intentionality  of  ‘consciousness’  is  grounded  in  [Italics  in  newer
editions  only.—Tr.]  the  ecstatical  unity  of  Dasein,  and  how  this  is  the  case,  will  be  shown  in  the
following Division. [This Division has never been published.—Tr.]
 

1.  ‘  “entgegenwerfen”  ’.  Heidegger  is  here  calling  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  word  ‘object’

literally means ‘something thrown against’.

H. 364

 

 

If  the  thematizing  of  the  present-at-hand—the  scientific  projection  of
Nature—is  to  become  possible,  Dasein  must  transcend  the  entities
thematized.  Transcendence  does  not  consist  in  Objectifying,  but  is
presupposed  by  it.  If,  however,  the  thematizing  of  the  present-at-hand
within-the-world  is  a  change-over  from  the  concern  which  discovers  by
circumspection, then one’s ‘practical’ Being alongside the ready-to-hand is
something which a transcendence of Dasein must already underlie.

If, moreover, thematizing modifies and Articulates the understanding of
Being, then, in so far as Dasein, the entity which thematizes, exists, it must
already understand something like Being. Such understanding of Being can
remain  neutral.  In  that  case  readiness-to-hand  and  presence-at-hand  have
not yet been distinguished; still less have they been conceived ontologically.
But  if  Dasein  is  to  be  able  to  have  any  dealings  with  a  context  of
equipment,  it  must  understand  something  like  an  involvement,  even  if  it
does not  do so thematically: a world  must have been disclosed to  it.  With
Dasein’s factical existence, this world has been disclosed, if Dasein indeed
exists  essentially  as  Being-in-the-world.(1)  And  if  Dasein’s  Being  is
completely  grounded  in  temporality,  then  temporality  must  make  possible
Being-in-the-world 
this
transcendence in  turn  provides the  support for  concernful  Being  alongside
entities within-the-world, whether this Being is theoretical or practical.

(c) The Temporal Problem of the Transcendence of the World

Circumspective  concern  includes  the  understanding  of  a  totality  of
involvements, and this understanding is based upon a prior understanding of
the  relationships  of  the  “in-order-to”,  the”  towards-which”,  the  “towards-
this”,  and the  “for-the-sake-of”. The interconnection of these relationships
has  been  exhibited  earlier(xxiv)  as  “significance”.  Their  unity  makes  up
what  we  call  the  “world”.  The  question  arises  of  how  anything  like  the
world in its unity with Dasein is ontologically possible. In what way must
the world be, if Dasein is to be able to exist as Being-in-the-World?

Dasein exists for the sake of a potentiality-for-Being of itself. In existing,
it has been thrown; and as something thrown, it has been delivered over to
entities  which  it  needs  in  order  to  be  able  to  be  as  it  is—namely,  for  the
sake of itself. In so far as Dasein exists factically, it understands itself in the
way  its  “for-the-sake-of-itself”  is  thus  connected  with  some  current  “in-
order-to”.  That  inside  which  existing  Dasein  understands  itself,  is  ‘there’
along  with  its  factical  existence.  That  inside  which  one  primarily
understands  oneself  has  Dasein’s  kind  of  Being.  Dasein  is  its  world
existingly.
 

xxiv. Cf. Section 18, H. 87 ff.

H. 365

 

We have defined Dasein’s Being as “care”. The ontological meaning of
“care”  is  temporality.  We  have  shown  that  temporality  constitutes  the
disclosedness  of  the  “there”,  and  we  have  shown  how  it  does  so.  In  the
disclosedness of the “there” the world is disclosed along with it. The unity
of  significance—that  is,  the  ontological  constitution  of  the  world—must
then  likewise  be  grounded  in  temporality.  The  existential-temporal
condition for the possibility of the world lies in the fact that temporality, as
an  ecstatical  unity,  has  something  like  a  horizon.  Ecstases  are  not  simply
raptures  in  which  one  gets  carried  away.  Rather,  there  belongs  to  each
ecstasis a ‘whither’ to which one is carried away.(1) This “whither” of the
ecstasis  we  call  the  “horizonal  schema”.  In  each  of  the  three  ecstases  the
ecstatical horizon is different. The schema in which Dasein comes towards
itself futurally, whether authentically or inauthentically, is the “for-the-sake-
of-itself”. The  schema  in  which  Dasein  is  disclosed  to  itself  in  a  state-of-
mind  as  thrown,  is  to  be  taken  as  that  in  the  face  of  which  it  has  been
thrown  and  that  to  which  it  has  been  abandoned.  This  characterizes  the
horizonal  schema  of  what  has  been.  In  existing  for  the  sake  of  itself  in
abandonment to itself as something that has been thrown, Dasein, as Being-
alongside, is at the same time making present. The horizonal schema for the
Present is defined by the “in-order-to”.
 

1. ‘Die Ekstasen sind nicht einfach Entrückungen zu... Vielmehr gehört zur Ekstase ein “Wohin”

der Entrückung.’

The unity of the horizonal schemata of future, Present, and having been,
is  grounded  in  the  ecstatical  unity  of  temporality.  The  horizon  of
temporality  as  a  whole  determines  that  whereupon  [woraufhin]  factically
existing entities are essentially disclosed. With one’s factical Being-there, a
potentiality-for-Being is in each case projected in the horizon of the future,
one’s  ‘Being-already’  is  disclosed  in  the  horizon  of  having  been,  and  that
with which one concerns oneself is discovered in the horizon of the Present.
The  horizonal  unity  of  the  schemata  of  these  ecstases  makes  possible  the
primordial way in which the relationships of the “in-order-to” are connected
with  the  “for-the-sake-of”.  This  implies  that  on  the  basis  of  the  horizonal
constitution  of  the  ecstatical  unity  of  temporality,  there  belongs  to  that
entity which is in each case its own “there”, something like a world that has
been disclosed.

Just as the Present arises in the unity of the temporalizing of temporality
out  of  the  future  and  having  been,  the  horizon  of  a  Present  temporalizes
itself equiprimordially with those of the future and of having been. In so far
as  Dasein  temporalizes  itself,  a  world  is  too.  In  temporalizing  itself  with
regard to its Being as temporality, Dasein is(1) essentially ‘in a world’, by
reason of the ecstatico-horizonal constitution of that temporality. The world
is  neither  present-at-hand  nor  ready-to-hand,  but  temporalizes  itself  in
temporality. It ‘is’, with the “outside-of-itself” of the ecstases, ‘there’. If no
Dasein exists, no world is ‘there’ either.

The world is already presupposed in one’s Being alongside the ready-to-
hand  concernfully  and  factically,  in  one’s  thematizing  of  the  present-at-
hand, and in one’s discovering of this latter entity by Objectification; that is
to say, all these are possible only as ways of Being-in-the-world. Having its
ground [gründend] in the horizonal unity of ecstatical temporality, the world
is  transcendent.  It  must  already  have  been  ecstatically  disclosed  so  that  in
terms  of  it  entities  within-the-world  can  be  encountered.  Temporality
already maintains itself ecstatically within the horizons of its ecstases; and
in  temporalizing  itself,  it  comes  back  to  those  entities  which  are
encountered in the “there”. With Dasein’s factical existence, entities within-

the-world  are  already  encountered  too.  The  fact  that  such  entities  are
discovered  along  with  Dasein’s  own  “there”  of  existence,  is  not  left  to
Dasein’s  discretion.  Only  what  it  discovers  and  discloses  on  occasion,  in
what  direction  it  does  so,  how  and  how  far  it  does  so—only  these  are
matters  for  Dasein’s  freedom,  even  if  always  within  the  limitations  of  its
thrownness.

Thus the significance-relationships which determine the structure of the
world  are  not  a  network  of  forms  which  a  worldless  subject  has  laid  over
some  kind  of  material.  What  is  rather  the  case  is  that  factical  Dasein,
understanding  itself  and  its  world  ecstatically  in  the  unity  of  the  “there”,
comes  back  from  these  horizons  to  the  entities  encountered  within  them.
Coming back to these entities understandingly is the existential meaning of
letting  them  be  encountered  by  making  them  present;  that  is  why  we  call
them entities “within-the-world”. The world is, as it were, already ‘further
outside’  than  any  Object  can  ever  be.  The  ‘problem  of  transcendence’
cannot be brought round to the question of how a subject comes out to an
Object,  where  the  aggregate  of  Objects  is  identified  with  the  idea  of  the
world. Rather we must ask: what makes it ontologically possible for entities
to be encountered within-the-world and Objectified as so encountered? This
can  be  answered  by  recourse  to  the  transcendence  of  the  world—a
transcendence with an ecstatico-horizonal foundation.

If the ‘subject’ gets conceived ontologically as an existing Dasein whose
Being  is  grounded  in  temporality,  then  one  must  say  that  the  world  is
‘subjective’.  But  in  that  case,  this  ‘subjective’  world,  as  one  that  is
temporally transcendent, is ‘more Objective’ than any possible ‘Object’.

When Being-in-the-world is traced back to the ecstatico-horizonal unity
of  temporality,  the  existential-ontological  possibility  of  this  basic  state  of
Dasein  is  made  intelligible.  At  the  same  time  it  becomes  plain  that  a
concrete  working-out  of  the  world-structure  in  general  and  its  possible
variations can be tackled only if the ontology of possible entities within-the-
world is oriented securely enough by clarifying the idea of Being in general.
If an Interpretation of this idea is to be possible, the temporality of Dasein
must  be  exhibited  beforehand;  here  our  characterization  of  Being-in-the-
world will be of service.

70. The Temporality of the Spatiality that is Characteristic of Dasein

 

 

H. 367

Though  the  expression  ‘temporality’  does  not  signify  what  one
understands by “time” when one talks about ‘space and time’, nevertheless
spatiality seems to make up another basic attribute of Dasein corresponding
to  temporality.  Thus  with  Dasein’s  spatiality,  existential-temporal  analysis
seems to come to a limit, so that this entity which we call “Dasein”, must be
considered  as  ‘temporal’  ‘and  also’  as  spatial  coordinately.  Has  our
existential-temporal analysis of Dasein thus been brought to a halt by that
phenomenon with which we have become acquainted as the spatiality that is
characteristic  of  Dasein,  and  which  we  have  pointed  out  as  belonging  to
Being-in-the-world?(xxv)

If  in  the  course  of  our  existential  Interpretation  we  were  to  talk  about
Dasein’s having a ‘spatio-temporal’ character, we could not mean that this
entity  is  present-at-hand  ‘in  space  and  also  in  time’;  this  needs  no  further
discussion.  Temporality  is  the  meaning  of  the  Being  of  care.  Dasein’s
constitution and its ways to be are possible ontologically only on the basis
of  temporality,  regardless  of  whether  this  entity  occurs  ‘in  time’  or  not.
Hence Dasein’s specific spatiality must be grounded in temporality. On the
other  hand,  the  demonstration  that  this  spatiality  is  existentially  possible
only through temporality, cannot aim either at deducing space from time or
at  dissolving  it  into  pure  time.  If  Dasein’s  spatiality  is  ‘embraced’  by
temporality  in  the  sense  of  being  existentially  founded  upon  it,  then  this
connection between them (which is to be clarified in what follows) is also
different  from  the  priority  of  time  over  space  in  Kant’s  sense.  To  say  that
our empirical representations of what is present-at-hand ‘in space’ run their
course  ‘in  time’  as  psychical  occurrences,  so  that  the  ‘physical’  occurs
mediately  ‘in  time’  also,  is  not  to  give  an  existential-ontological
Interpretation  of  space  as  a  form  of  intuition,  but  rather  to  establish
ontically that what is psychically present-at-hand runs its course ‘in time’.
 

xxv. Cf. Sections 22-24, H. 101, ff.

H. 368

 

We  must  now  make  an  existential-analytical  inquiry  as  to  the  temporal
conditions,  for  the  possibility  of  the  spatiality  that  is  characteristic  of
Dasein—the  spatiality  upon  which  in  turn  is  founded  the  uncovering  of
space  within-the-world.  We  must  first  remember  in  what  way  Dasein  is
spatial.  Dasein  can  be  spatial  only  as  care,  in  the  sense  of  existing  as
factically  falling.  Negatively  this  means  that  Dasein  is  never  present-at-
hand in space, not even proximally. Dasein does not fill up a bit of space as
a Real Thing or item of equipment would, so that the boundaries dividing it
from  the  surrounding  space  would  themselves  just  define  that  space
spatially. Dasein takes space in; this is to be understood literally.(1) It is by
no  means  just  present-at-hand  in  a  bit  of  space  which  its  body  fills  up.  In
existing, it has already made room for its own leeway. It determines its own
location  in  such  a  manner  that  it  comes  back  from  the  space  it  has  made
room  for  to  the  ‘place’  which  it  has  reserved.(2)  To  be  able  to  say  that
Dasein  is  present-at-hand  at  a  position  in  space,  we  must  first  take
[auffassen] this  entity  in  a  way  which  is  ontologically  inappropriate.  Nor
does the distinction between the ‘spatiality’ of an extended Thing and that
of Dasein lie in the fact that Dasein knows about space; for taking space in
[das Raum-einnehmen] is so far from identical with a ‘representing’ of the
spatial, that it is presupposed by it instead. Neither may Dasein’s spatiality
be  interpreted  as  an  imperfection  which  adheres  to  existence  by  reason  of
the fatal ‘linkage of the spirit to a body’. On the contrary, because Dasein is
‘spiritual’,  and  only  because  of  this,  it  can  be  spatial  in  a  way  which
remains essentially impossible for any extended corporeal Thing.
 

1. ‘Das Dasein nimmt—im wörtlichen Verstande—Raum ein.’ The expression ‘nimmt Raum ein’
would ordinarily be translatable as ‘occupies space’ or even ‘takes up space’. But Heidegger is here
interpreting it in a way which is closer to the root meaning.

2. ‘Existierend hat es sich je schon einen Spielraum eingeräumt. Es bestimmt je seinen eigenen
Ort so, dass es aus dem eingeräumten Raum auf den “Platz” zurückkommt, den es belegt hat.’ This
passage can be read in several ways. ‘Spielraum’ (our ‘leeway’) means literally a ‘space—or room—
for  playing’.  The  expression  ‘belegen  einen  Platz’  ordinarily  means  to  book  or  reserve  a  seat  at  a
theatre or some other place of entertainment; but in a more general and basic sense, ‘belegen’ (which
is  a  word  of  many  meanings)  can  also  mean  to  spread  something  over  something  else  so  as  to
‘occupy’ it completely—as one spreads a slice of bread with butter or covers a wall with plaster. On
‘einräumen’ see our note 1, H. 111 above.

Dasein’s making room  for  itself is  constituted by  directionality and de-
severance. How is anything of this sort existentially possible on the basis of
Dasein’s  temporality?  The  function  of  temporality  as  the  foundation  for

is 

of 

equipment  which 

Dasein’s spatiality will be indicated briefly, but no more than is necessary
for  our  later  discussions  of  the  ontological  meaning  of  the  ‘coupling
together’ of space and time. To Dasein’s making room for itself belongs the
self-directive discovery of something like a region. By this expression what
we  have  in  mind  in  the  first  instance  is  the  “whither”  for  the  possible
ready-to-hand
belonging-somewhere 
environmentally  and  which  can  be  placed.  Whenever  one  comes  across
equipment,  handles  it,  or  moves  it  around  or  out  of  the  way,  some  region
has  already  been  discovered.  Concernful  Being-in-the-world  is  directional
—self-directive.  Belonging-somewhere  has  an  essential  relationship  to
involvement.  It  always  Determines  itself  factically  in  terms  of  the
involvement-context  of  the  equipment  with  which  one  concerns  oneself.
Relationships  of  involvement  are  intelligible  only  within  the  horizon  of  a
world that has been disclosed. Their horizonal character, moreover, is what
first  makes  possible  the  specific  horizon  of  the  “whither”  of  belonging-
somewhere regionally. The self-directive discovery of a region is grounded
in  an  ecstatically  retentive  awaiting  of  the  “hither”  and  “thither”  that  are
possible. Making room for oneself is a directional awaiting of a region, and
as such it is equiprimordially a bringing-close (de-severing*) of the ready-
to-hand  and  present-at-hand.  Out  of  the  region  that  has  been  discovered
beforehand,  concern  comes  back  de-severantly  to  that  which  is  closest.
Both  bringing-close  and  the  estimating  and  measurement  of  distances
within  that  which  has  been  de-severed  and  is  present-at-hand  within-the-
world,  are  grounded  in  a  making-present  belonging  to  the  unity  of  that
temporality in which directionality too becomes possible.

H. 369

 

Because Dasein as temporality is ecstatico-horizonal in its Being, it can
take  along  with  it  a  space  for  which  it  has  made  room,  and  it  can  do  so
factically and constantly. With regard to that space which it has ecstatically
taken  in,  the  “here”  of  its  current  factical  situation  [Lage  bzw.  Situation]
never  signifies  a  position  in  space,  but  signifies  rather  the  leeway  of  the
range of that equipmental totality with which it is most closely concerned—
a  leeway  which  has  been  opened  up  for  it  in  directionality  and  de-
severance.

Bringing-close  makes  possible  the  kind  of  handling  and  Being-busy
which  is  ‘absorbed  in  the  thing  one  is  handling’  [“in  der  Sache
aufgehende”]; and in such bringing-close, the essential structure of care—
falling—makes itself known. In falling, and therefore also in the bringing-
close which is founded ‘in the present’, the forgetting which awaits, leaps
after  the  Present;  this  is  what  is  distinctive  in  the  existential-temporal
Constitution of falling.(1) When we make something present by bringing it
close  from  its  “thence”  [seinem  Dorther],  the  making-present  forgets  the
“yonder”  [das  Dort]  and  loses  itself  in  itself.  Thus  it  comes  about  that  if
‘observation’  of  entities  within-the-world  commences  in  such  a  making-
present,  the  illusion  arises  that  ‘at  first’  only  a  Thing  is  present-at-hand,
here of course, but indefinitely—in a space in general.
 

1.  ‘Dessen  existenzial-zeitliche  Konstitution  ist  dadurch  ausgezeichnet,  dass  in  ihm  und  damit
auch  in  der  “gegenwärtig”  fundierten  Näherung  das  gewärtigende  Vergessen  der  Gegenwart
nachspringt.’

Only on the basis of its ecstatico-horizonal temporality is it possible for
Dasein to break into space. The world is not present-at-hand in space; yet
only  within  a  world  does  space  let  itself  be  discovered.  The  ecstatical
temporality  of  the  spatiality  that  is  characteristic  of  Dasein,  makes  it
intelligible  that  space  is  independent  of  time;  but  on  the  other  hand,  this
same temporality also makes intelligible Dasein’s ‘dependence’ on space—
a ‘dependence’ which manifests itself in the well-known phenomenon that
both  Dasein’s  interpretation  of  itself  and  the  whole  stock  of  significations
which belong to language in general are dominated through and through by
‘spatial  representations’.  This  priority  of  the  spatial  in  the  Articulation  of
concepts and significations has its basis not in some specific power which
space  possesses,  but  in  Dasein’s  kind  of  Being.  Temporality  is  essentially
falling,  and  it  loses  itself  in  making  present;  not  only  does  it  understand
itself  circumspectively  in  terms  of  objects  of  concern  which  are  ready-to-
hand,  but  from  those  spatial  relationships  which  making-present  is
constantly  meeting  in  the  ready-to-hand  as  having  presence,  it  takes  its
clues for Articulating that which has been understood and can be interpreted
in the understanding in general.

71. The Temporal Meaning of Dasein’s Everydayness

 

 

H. 370

We have given an Interpretation of some structures which are essential to
Dasein’s state-of-Being, and we have done so before exhibiting temporality,
but  with  the  aim  of  leading  up  to  this.  Our  analysis  of  the  temporality  of
concern has shown that these structures must be taken back into temporality
existentially.  At  the  very  start  of  our  analytic  we  did  not  choose  as  our
theme  any  definite  and  distinctive  possibility  of  Dasein’s  existence;  our
analytic  was  oriented  rather  by  the  average  way  of  existing,  which  has
nothing conspicuous about it. We called that kind of Being in which Dasein
maintains itself proximally and for the most part “everydayness”.(xxvi)

What  this  expression  signifies  at  bottom  when  delimited  ontologically,
remains obscure. At the beginning of our study, moreover, we could not see
the  existential-ontological  meaning  of
any  way  of  even  making 
“everydayness” a problem. By now, however, some light has been cast on
the meaning of Dasein’s Being as temporality. Can there still be any doubt
as to the existential-temporal signification of the term “everydayness”? All
the  same,  we  are  far  removed  from  an  ontological  conception  of  this
phenomenon.  It  even  remains  questionable  whether  the  explication  of
temporality which we have so far carried through is sufficient to delimit the
existential meaning of “everydayness”.

“Everydayness”  manifestly  stands  for  that  way  of  existing  in  which
Dasein maintains itself ‘every day’ [“alle Tage”]. And yet this ‘every day’
does not signify the sum of those ‘days’ which have been allotted to Dasein
in  its  ‘lifetime’.  Though  this  ‘every  day’  is  not  to  be  understood
calendrically, there is still an overtone of some such temporal character in
the signification of the ‘everyday’ [“Alltag”]. But what we have primarily
in  mind in  the  expression “everydayness” is  a definite “how” of existence
by which Dasein is dominated through and through ‘for life’ [“zeitlebens”].
In our analyses we have often used the expression ‘proximally and for the
most part’. ‘Proximally’ signifies the way in which Dasein is ‘manifest’ in
the  “with-one-another”  of  publicness,  even  if  ‘at  bottom’  everydayness  is
precisely  something  which,  in  an  existentiell  manner,  it  has  ‘surmounted’.
‘For  the  most  part’  signifies  the  way  in  which  Dasein  shows  itself  for
Everyman, not always, but ‘as a rule’.
 

xxvi. Cf. Section 9, H. 42 ff.

H. 371

 

“Everydayness”  means  the  “how”  in  accordance  with  which  Dasein
‘lives  unto  the  day’  [“in  den  Tag  hineinlebt”],  whether  in  all  its  ways  of
behaving  or  only  in  certain  ones  which  have  been  prescribed  by  Being-
with-one-another. To this “how” there belongs further the comfortableness
of  the  accustomed,  even  if  it  forces  one  to  do  something  burdensome  and
‘repugnant’.  That  which  will  come  tomorrow  (and  this  is  what  everyday
concern  keeps  awaiting)  is  ‘eternally  yesterday’s’.  In  everydayness
everything is all one and the same, but whatever the day may bring is taken
as  diversification.  Everydayness  is  determinative  for  Dasein  even  when  it
has not chosen the “they” for its ‘hero’.

These  manifold  characteristics  of  everydayness,  however,  by  no  means
designate it as a mere ‘aspect’ afforded by Dasein when ‘one looks at’ the
things  men  do.  Everydayness  is  a  way  to  be—to  which,  of  course,  that
which  is  publicly  manifest  belongs.  But  it  is  more  or  less  familiar  to  any
‘individual’ Dasein as a way of existing which it may have as its own, and
it is familiar to it through that state-of-mind which consists of a pallid lack
of mood. In everydayness Dasein can undergo dull ‘suffering’, sink away in
the dullness of it, and evade it by seeking new ways in which its dispersion
in its affairs may be further dispersed. In the moment of vision, indeed, and
often just ‘for that moment’, existence can even gain the mastery over the
“everyday”; but it can never extinguish it.

That which is ontically so familiar in the way Dasein has been factically
interpreted  that  we  never  pay  any  heed  to  it,  hides  enigma  after  enigma
existential-ontologically.  The  ‘natural’  horizon  for  starting  the  existential
analytic of Dasein is only seemingly self-evident.

But after the Interpretation of temporality which we have given thus far,
do  we  find  ourselves  in  any  more  promising  a  situation  with  regard  to
delimiting  the  structure  of  everydayness  existentially?  Or  does  this
bewildering  phenomenon  make  the  inadequacy  of  our  explication  of
temporality  all  too  patent?  Have  we  not  hitherto  been  constantly
immobilizing  Dasein  in  certain  situations,  while  we  have,  ‘consistently’
with  this,  been  disregarding  the  fact  that  in  living  unto  its  days  Dasein
stretches  itself  along  ‘temporally’  in  the  sequence  of  those  days?(1)  The

“it’s  all  one  and  the  same”,  the  accustomed,  the  ‘like  yesterday,  so  today
and  tomorrow’,  and  the  ‘for  the  most  part’—these  are  not  to  be  grasped
without recourse to this ‘temporal’ stretching-along of Dasein.

H. 372

 

And  is  it  not  also  a  Fact  of  existing  Dasein  that  in  spending  its  time  it
takes  ‘time’  into  its  reckoning  from  day  to  day  and  regulates  this
‘reckoning’  astronomically  and  calendrically?  Only  if  both  Dasein’s
everyday  ‘historizing’(2)  and  the  reckoning  with  ‘time’  with  which  it
concerns  itself  in  this  historizing,  are  included  in  our  Interpretation  of
Dasein’s temporality, will our orientation be embracing enough to enable us
to make a problem of the ontological meaning of everydayness as such. But
because at bottom we mean by the term “everydayness” nothing else than
temporality,  while  temporality  is  made  possible  by  Dasein’s  Being,(3)  an
adequate  conceptual  delimitation  of  everydayness  can  succeed  only  in  a
framework  in  which  the  meaning  of  Being  in  general  and  its  possible
variations are discussed in principle.

72. Existential-ontological Exposition of the Problem of History

 

 

ALL our efforts in the existential analytic serve the one aim of finding a
possibility of answering the question of the meaning of Being(1) in general.
To work out this question,(1) we need to delimit that very phenomenon in
which  something  like  Being  becomes  accessible—the  phenomenon  of  the
understanding  of  Being.  But  this  phenomenon  is  one  that  belongs  to
Dasein’s state of Being. Only after this entity has been Interpreted in a way
which  is  sufficiently  primordial,  can  we  have  a  conception  of  the
understanding  of Being,  which is  included  in  its very state  of Being; only
on  this  basis  can  we  formulate  the  question  of  the  Being  which  is
understood  in  this  understanding,  and  the  question  of  what  such
understanding ‘presupposes’.
 

1. Italics provided only in the later editions.

Even  though  many  structures  of  Dasein  when  taken  singly  are  still
obscure,  it  seems  that  by  casting  light  upon  temporality  as  the  primordial
condition  for  the  possibility  of  care,  we  have  reached  the  primordial
Interpretation  of  Dasein  which  we  require.  We  have  exhibited  temporality
with a view to Dasein’s authentic potentiality-for-Being-a-whole. We have
then  confirmed  the  temporal  Interpretation  of  care  by  demonstrating  the
temporality of concernful Being-in-the-world. Our analysis of the authentic
potentiality-for-Being-a-whole  has  revealed  that  in  care  is  rooted  an
equiprimordial  connectedness  of  death,  guilt,  and  conscience.  Can  Dasein
be understood in a way that is more primordial than in the projection of its
authentic existence?

H. 373

 

Although  up  till  now  we  have  seen  no  possibility  of  a  more  radical
approach to the existential analytic, yet, if we have regard for the preceding

discussion  of  the  ontological  meaning  of  everydayness,  a  difficult
consideration comes to light. Have we indeed brought the whole of Dasein,
as  regards  its  authentically  Being-a-whole,  into  the  fore-having  of  our
existential analysis? It may be that a formulation of the question as related
to Dasein’s totality, possesses a genuinely unequivocal character 
ontologically. It may be that as regards Being-towards-the-end the question
itself  may  even  have  found  its  answer.  But  death  is  only  the  ‘end’  of
Dasein;  and,  taken  formally,  it  is  just  one  of  the  ends  by  which  Dasein’s
totality  is  closed  round.  The  other  ‘end’,  however,  is  the  ‘beginning’,  the
‘birth’.  Only  that  entity  which  is  ‘between’  birth  and  death  presents  the
whole  which  we  have  been  seeking.  Accordingly  the  orientation  of  our
analytic  has  so  far  remained  ‘one-sided’,  in  spite  of  all  its  tendencies
towards  a  consideration  of  existent  Being-a-whole  and  in  spite  of  the
genuineness  with  which  authentic  and  inauthentic  Being-towards-death
have been explicated. Dasein has been our theme only in the way in which
it  exists  ‘facing  forward’,  as  it  were,  leaving  ‘behind  it’  all  that  has  been.
Not only has Being-towards-the-beginning remained unnoticed; but so too,
and  above  all,  has  the  way  in  which  Dasein  stretches along  between birth
and death. The ‘connectedness of life’, in which Dasein somehow maintains
itself  constantly,  is  precisely  what  we  have  overlooked  in  our  analysis  of
Being-a-whole.

We have regarded temporality as the meaning of the Being of Dasein’s
totality; must we not now take this back, even if what we have described as
the ‘connectedness’ between birth and death is ontologically quite obscure?
Or does temporality, as we have exhibited it, first of all give us the basis on
which  to  provide  an  unequivocal  direction  for  the  existential-ontological
question  of  this  ‘connectedness’?  In  the  field  of  these  investigations,  it  is
perhaps already a gain, when we learn not to take problems too lightly.

What  seems  ‘simpler’  than  to  characterize  the  ‘connectedness  of  life’
between birth and death? It consists of a sequence of Experiences ‘in time’.
But if one makes a more penetrating study of this way of characterizing the
‘connectedness’ in question, and especially of the ontological assumptions
behind  it,  the  remarkable  upshot  is  that,  in  this  sequence  of  Experiences,
what  is  ‘really’  ‘actual’  is,  in  each  case,  just  that  Experience  which  is
present-at-hand  ‘in  the  current  “now”  ’,  while  those  Experiences  which
have passed away or are only coming along, either are no longer or are not
yet ‘actual’. Dasein traverses the span of time granted to it between the two

boundaries, and it does so in such a way that, in each case, it is ‘actual’ only
in the “now”, and hops, as it were, through the sequence of “flows” of its
own ‘time’. Thus it is said that Dasein is ‘temporal’. In spite of the constant
changing  of these Experiences, the  Self  maintains itself throughout  with  a
certain selfsameness. Opinions diverge as to how that which thus persists is
to  be  defined,  and  how  one  is  to  determine  what  relation  it  may  possibly
have to the changing Experiences. The Being of this perseveringly changing
connectedness  of  Experiences  remains  indefinite.  But  at  bottom,  whether
one likes it or not, in this way of characterizing the connectedness of life,
one has posited something present-at-hand ‘in time’, though something that
is obviously ‘un-Thinglike’.

H. 374

 

If  we  have  regard  for  what  we  have  worked  out  under  the  title  of
“temporality”  as  the  meaning  of  the  Being  of  care,  we  find  that  while  the
ordinary interpretation of Dasein, within its own limits, has its justification
and is sufficient, we cannot carry through a genuine ontological analysis of
the  way  Dasein  stretches  along  between  birth  and  death  if  we  take  this
interpretation as our clue, nor can we  even fix  upon  such an analysis as a
problem.

Dasein  does  not  exist  as  the  sum  of  the  momentary  actualities  of
Experiences  which  come  along  successively  and  disappear.  Nor  is  there  a
sort of framework which this succession gradually fills up. For how is such
a  framework  to  be  present-at-hand,  where,  in  each  case,  only  the
Experience  one  is  having  ‘right  now’  is  ‘actual’,(1)  and  the  boundaries  of
the  framework—the  birth  which  is  past  and  the  death  which  is  only
oncoming—lack  actuality?  At  bottom,  even  in  the  ordinary  way  of  taking
the ‘connectedness of life’, one does not think of this as a framework drawn
tense ‘outside’ of Dasein and spanning it round, but one rightly seeks this
connectedness  in  Dasein  itself.  When,  however,  one  tacitly  regards  this
entity ontologically as something present-at-hand ‘in time’, any attempt at
an ontological characterization of the Being ‘between’ birth and death will
break down.
 

1. ‘…wo doch je nur das “aktuelle” Erlebnis “wirklich” ist…’

Dasein  does  not  fill  up  a  track  or  stretch  ‘of  life’—one  which  is
somehow present-at-hand—with the phases of its momentary actualities. It
stretches  itself  along  in  such  a  way  that  its  own  Being  is  constituted  in
advance  as  a  stretching-along.  The  ‘between’  which  relates  to  birth  and
death  already  lies  in  the  Being  of  Dasein.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  by  no
means the case that Dasein ‘is’ actual in a point of time, and that, apart from
this,  it  is  ‘surrounded’  by  the  non-actuality  of  its  birth  and  death.
Understood  existentially,  birth  is  not  and  never  is  something  past  in  the
sense of something no longer present-at-hand; and death is just as far from
having the kind of Being of something still outstanding, not yet present-at-
hand  but  coming  along.  Factical  Dasein  exists  as  born;  and,  as  born,  it  is
already  dying,  in  the  sense  of  Being-towards-death.  As  long  as  Dasein
factically exists, both the ‘ends’ and their ‘between’ are, and they are in the
only  way  which  is  possible  on  the  basis  of  Dasein’s  Being  as  care.
Thrownness  and  that  Being  towards  death  in  which  one  either  flees  it  or
anticipates it, form a unity; and in this unity birth and death are ‘connected’
in a manner characteristic of Dasein. As care, Dasein is the ‘between’.

H. 375

 

In  temporality,  however,  the  constitutive  totality  of  care  has  a  possible
basis for its unity. Accordingly it is within the horizon of Dasein’s temporal
constitution  that  we  must  approach  the  ontological  clarification  of  the
‘connectedness of life’—that is to say, the stretching-along, the movement,
and  the  persistence  which  are  specific  for  Dasein.  The  movement
[Bewegtheit]  of  existence  is  not  the  motion  [Bewegung]  of  something
present-at-hand. It is definable in terms of the way Dasein stretches along.
The  specific  movement  in  which  Dasein  is  stretched  along  and  stretches
itself  along,  we  call  its  “historizing”.(1)  The  question  of  Dasein’s
‘connectedness’  is  the  ontological  problem  of  Dasein’s  historizing.  To  lay
bare the structure of historizing,  and the  existential-temporal conditions of
its possibility, signifies that one has achieved an ontological  understanding
of historicality.(2)

With  the  analysis  of  the  specific  movement  and  persistence  which
belong  to  Dasein’s  historizing,  we  come  back  in  our  investigation  to  the
problem which we touched upon immediately before exposing temporality
to view—the question of the constancy of the Self, which we defined as the

“who” of Dasein.(i) Self-constancy(3) is a way of Being of Dasein, and is
therefore grounded in a specific temporalizing of temporality. The analysis
of  historizing  will  lead  us  face  to  face  with  the  problems  of  a  thematical
investigation of temporalizing as such.
 

i. Cf. Section 64, H. 316 ff.

 

1.  Die  spezifische  Bewegtheit  des  erstreckten  Sicherstreckens  nennen  wir  das  Geschehen  des

Daseins.’ On ‘Geschehen’ see our note 1, H. 19 above.

2. On ‘historicality’ (‘Geschichtlichkeit’) see our note 2, H. 10 above.
3.  ‘Selbst-ständigkeit’.  Here  we  follow  the  reading  of  the  older  editions  in  which  the  hyphen
comes at the end of a line. In the newer editions the hyphen is omitted; but presumably Heidegger
intends the same expanded spelling which we have already met on H. 322 and H. 332. See our notes
ad loc.

If the question of historicality leads us back to these ‘sources’, then the
locus of the problem of history has already been decided. This locus is  not
to be sought in historiology as the science of history. Even if the problem of
‘history’ is treated in accordance with a theory of science, not only aiming
at the ‘epistemological’ clarification of the historiological way of grasping
things  (Simmel)  or  at  the  logic  with  which  the  concepts  of  historiological
presentation are formed (Rickert), but doing so with an orientation towards
‘the side of the object’, then, as long as the question is formulated this way,
history  becomes  in  principle  accessible  only  as  the  Object  of  a  science.
Thus  the  basic  phenomenon  of  history,  which  is  prior  to  any  possible
thematizing  by  historiology  and  underlies  it,  has  been  irretrievably  put
aside.  How  history  can  become  a  possible  object  for  historiology  is
something that may be gathered only from the kind of Being which belongs
to  the  historical—from  historicality,  and  from  the  way  it  is  rooted  in
temporality.

H. 376

 

If we are to cast light on historicality itself in terms of temporality, and
primordially in terms of temporality that is authentic, then it is essential to
this task that we can carry it out only by construing it phenomenologically.
(ii) The existential-ontological constitution of historicality has been covered
up by the way Dasein’s history is ordinarily interpreted; we must get hold of
it in spite of all this. The existential  way  of construing  historicality has its

definite supports in the ordinary understanding of Dasein, and is guided by
those existential structures at which we have hitherto arrived.

We shall first describe the ordinary ways in which history is conceived,
so that we may give our investigation an orientation as to those items which
are commonly held to be essential for history. Here, it must be made plain
what  is  primordially  considered  as  historical.  The  point  of  attack  for
expounding the ontological problem of historicality will thus be designated.
Our  Interpretation  of  Dasein’s  authentic  potentiality-for-Being-a-whole
and our analysis of care as temporality—an analysis which has arisen from
this 
for  construing  historicality
the  clue 
existentially.  The  existential  projection  of  Dasein’s  historicality  merely
reveals what already lies enveloped in the temporalizing of temporality. In
accordance  with  the  way  in  which  historicality  is  rooted  in  care,  Dasein
exists, in each case, as authentically or inauthentically historical. It becomes
plain  that  Dasein’s  inauthentic  historicality  lies  in  that  which—under  the
title of “everydayness”—we have looked upon, in the existential analytic of
Dasein, as the horizon that is closest to us.

Interpretation—offer  us 

Disclosing  and  interpreting  belong  essentially  to  Dasein’s  historizing.
Out of this kind of Being of the entity which exists historically, there arises
the  existentiell  possibility  of  disclosing  history  explicitly  and  getting  it  in
our  grasp.  The  fact  that  we  can  make  history  our  theme—that  is  to  say,
disclose it historiologically—is the presupposition for the possibility of the
way  one  ‘builds  up  the  historical  world  in  the  humane  sciences’.  The
existential  Interpretation  of  historiology  as  a  science  aims  solely  at
demonstrating  its  ontological  derivation  from  Dasein’s  historicality.  Only
from  here  can  we  stake  out  the  boundaries  within  which  any  theory  of
science  that  is  oriented  to  the  factical  workings  of  science,  may  expose
itself to the accidental factors in its way of formulating questions.

In  analysing  the  historicality  of  Dasein  we  shall  try  to  show  that  this
entity  is  not  ‘temporal’  because  it  ‘stands  in  history’,  but  that,  on  the
contrary, it exists historically and can so exist only because it is temporal in
the very basis of its Being.
 

ii. Cf. Section 63, H. 310 ff.

H. 377

 

Nevertheless,  Dasein  must  also  be  called  ‘temporal’  in  the  sense  of
Being  ‘in  time’.  Even  without  a  developed  historiology,  factical  Dasein
needs and uses a calendar and a clock. Whatever may happen ‘to Dasein’, it
experiences  it  as  happening  ‘in  time’.  In  the  same  way,  the  processes  of
Nature,  whether  living  or  lifeless,  are  encountered  ‘in  time’.  They  are
within-time.  So  while  our  analysis  of  how  the  ‘time’  of  within-time-ness
has  its  source  in  temporality  will  be  deferred  until  the  next  chapter,(iii)  it
would be easy to put this before our discussion of the connection between
historicality and temporality. The historical is ordinarily characterized with
the  help  of 
this  ordinary
time  of  within-time-ness.  But 
characterization  is  to  be  stripped  of  its  seeming  self-evidence  and
exclusiveness,  historicality  must  first  be  ‘deduced’  purely  in  terms  of
Dasein’s  primordial  temporality;  this  is  demanded  even  by  the  way  these
are  ‘objectively’ connected. Since,  however,  time  as within-time-ness also
‘stems’  from  the  temporality  of  Dasein,  historicality  and  within-time-ness
turn  out  to  be  equiprimordial.  Thus,  within  its  limits,  the  ordinary
interpretation of the temporal character of history is justified.

the 

if 

After  this  first  characterization  of  the  course  of  the  ontological
exposition of historicality in terms of temporality, do we still need explicit
assurance  that  the  following  investigation  does  not  rest  upon  a  belief  that
the problem of history is to be solved by a coup de main? The  poverty of
the  ‘categorial’  means  at  our  disposal,  and  the  unsureness  of  the  primary
ontological horizons, become the more obtrusive, the more the problem of
history  is  traced  to  its  primordial  roots.  In  the  following  study,  we  shall
content  ourselves  with  indicating  the  ontological  locus  of  the  problem  of
historicality.  The  researches  of  Dilthey  were,  for  their  part,  pioneering
work;  but  today’s  generation  has  not  as  yet  made  them  its  own.  In  the
following analysis the issue is solely one of furthering their adoption.

Our exposition of the existential problem of historicality—an exposition
which  is  necessarily  limited,  moreover,  in  that  its  goal  is  one  of
fundamental  ontology—is  divided  up  as 
the  ordinary
understanding  of  history,  and  Dasein’s  historizing  (Section  73);  the  basic
constitution of historicality (Section 74); Dasein’s historicality, and world-
history  (Section  75);  the  existential  source  of  historiology  in  Dasein’s
historicality (Section 76); the connection of the foregoing exposition of the
problem  of  historicality  with  the  researches  of  Dilthey  and  the  ideas  of
Count Yorck (Section 77).

73. The Ordinary Understanding of History, and Dasein’s Historizing

Our  next  aim  is  to  find  the  right  position  for  attacking  the  primordial
question of the essence of history—that is to say, for construing historicality
existentially.  This  position  is  designated  by  that  which  is  primordially
historical.  We  shall  begin  our  study,  therefore,  by  characterizing  what  one
has  in  view  in  using  the  expressions  ‘history’  and  ‘historical’  in  the
ordinary  interpretation  of  Dasein.  These  expressions  get  used  in  several
ways.

The  most  obvious  ambiguity  of  the  term  ‘history’  is  one  that  has  often
been noticed, and there is nothing ‘fuzzy’ about it. It evinces itself in that
this term may mean the ‘historical actuality’ as well as the possible science
of  it.  We  shall  provisionally  eliminate  the  signification  of  ‘history’  in  the
sense of a “science of history” (historiology).

The expression ‘history’ has various significations with which one has in
view  neither  the  science  of  history  nor  even  history  as  an  Object,  but  this
very  entity  itself,  not  necessarily  Objectified.  Among  such  significations,
that in which this entity is understood as something past,  may  well  be the
pre-eminent usage. This signification is evinced in the kind of talk in which
we  say  that  something  or  other  “already  belongs  to  history”.  Here  ‘past’
means  “no  longer  present-at-hand”,  or  even  “still  present-at-hand  indeed,
but without having any ‘effect’ on the ‘Present’ ”. Of course, the historical
as that which is past has also the opposite signification, when we say, “One
cannot  get  away  from  history.”  Here,  by  “history”,  we  have  in  view  that
which is past, but which nevertheless is still having effects. Howsoever, the
historical, as that which is past, is understood to be related to the ‘Present’
in  the  sense  of  what  is  actual  ‘now’  and  ‘today’,  and  to  be  related  to  it,
either  positively  or  privatively,  in  such  a  way  as  to  have  effects  upon  it.
Thus  ‘the  past’  has  a  remarkable  double  meaning;  the  past  belongs
irretrievably to an earlier time; it belonged to the events of that time; and in
spite of that, it can still be present-at-hand ‘now’—for instance, the remains

of  a  Greek  temple.  With  the  temple,  a  ‘bit  of  the  past’  is  still  ‘in  the
present’.

What we next have in mind with the term “history” is not so much ‘the
past’  in  the  sense  of  that  which  is  past,  but  rather  derivation  [Herkunft]
from  such  a  past.  Anything  that  ‘has  a  history’  stands  in  the  context  of  a
becoming. In such becoming, ‘development’ is sometimes a rise, sometimes
a fall. What ‘has a history’ in this way can, at the same time, ‘make’ such
history.  As  ‘epoch-making’,  it  determines  ‘a  future’  ‘in  the  present’.  Here
“history”  signifies  a  ‘context’  of  events  and  ‘effects’,  which  draws  on
through ‘the past’, the ‘Present’, and the ‘future’. On this view, the past has
no special priority.

H. 379

 

Further, “history” signifies the totality of those entities which change ‘in
time’,  and  indeed  the  transformations  and  vicissitudes  of  men,  of  human
groupings and their ‘cultures’, as distinguished from Nature, which likewise
operates  ‘in  time’.  Here  what  one  has  in  view  is  not  so  much  a  kind  of
Being—historizing—as  it  is  that  realm  of  entities  which  one  distinguishes
from  Nature  by  having  regard  for  the  way  in  which  man’s  existence  is
essentially  determined  by  ‘spirit’  and  ‘culture’,  even  though  in  a  certain
manner Nature too belongs to “history” as thus understood.

Finally,  whatever  has  been  handed  down  to  us  is  as  such  held  to  be
‘historical’,  whether  it  is  something  which  we  know  historiologically,  or
something  that  has  been  taken  over  as  self-evident,  with  its  derivation
hidden.

If we take these four significations together, the upshot is that history is
that specific historizing of existent Dasein which comes to pass in time, so
that  the  historizing  which  is  ‘past’  in  our  Being-with-one-another,  and
which at the same time has been ‘handed down to us’ and is continuingly
effective, is regarded as “history” in the sense that gets emphasized.

The  four  significations  are  connected  in  that  they  relate  to  man  as  the
‘subject’  of  events.  How  is  the  historizing  character  of  such  events  to  be
defined?  Is  historizing  a  sequence  of  processes,  an  ever-changing
emergence and disappearance of events? In what way does this historizing
of history  belong  to  Dasein?  Is Dasein already factically ‘present-at-hand’
to begin with, so that on occasion it can get ‘into a history’? Does Dasein

intertwined  with  events  and
first  become  historical  by  getting 
circumstances?  Or  is  the  Being  of  Dasein  constituted  first  of  all  by
historizing, so that anything like circumstances, events, and vicissitudes is
ontologically possible only because Dasein is historical in its Being? Why
is it that the function of the past gets particularly stressed when the Dasein
which historizes ‘in time’ is characterized ‘temporally’?

If  history  belongs  to  Dasein’s  Being,  and  this  Being  is  based  on
temporality,  then  it  would  be  easy  to  begin  the  existential  analysis  of
historicality  with  those  characteristics  of  the  historical  which  obviously
have  a  temporal  meaning.  Therefore,  by  characterizing  more  precisely  the
remarkably  privileged  position  of  the  ‘past’  in  the  concept  of  history,  we
shall prepare the way for expounding the basic constitution of historicality.

H. 380

 

The  ‘antiquities’  preserved  in  museums  (household  gear,  for  example)
belong  to  a  ‘time  which  is  past’;  yet  they  are  still  present-at-hand  in  the
‘Present’. How far is such equipment historical, when it is not yet past? Is it
historical, let us say, only because it has become an object of historiological
interest, of antiquarian study or national lore? But such equipment can be a
historiological  object  only  because  it  is  in  itself  somehow  historical.  We
repeat the question: by what right do we call this entity “historical”, when it
is not yet past? Or do these ‘Things’ have ‘in themselves’ ‘something past’,
even though they are still present-at-hand today? Then are these, which are
present-at-hand,  still  what  they  were?  Manifestly  these  ‘Things’  have
altered. The gear has become fragile or worm-eaten ‘in the course of time’.
But that specific character of the past which makes it something historical,
does  not  lie  in  this  transience,(1)  which  continues  even  during  the  Being-
present-at-hand of the equipment in the museum. What, then, is past in this
equipment?  What  were  these  ‘Things’  which  today  they  are  no  longer?
They are still definite items of equipment for use; but they are out of use.
Suppose, however, that they were still in use today, like many a household
heirloom; would they then be not yet historical? All the same, whether they
are in use or out of use, they are no longer what they were. What is ‘past’?
Nothing  else  than  that  world  within  which  they  belonged  to  a  context  of
equipment and were encountered as ready-to-hand and used by a concernful
Dasein  who  was-in-the-world.  That  world  is  no  longer.  But  what  was

formerly within-the-world with respect to that world is still present-at-hand.
As equipment belonging to a world, that which is now still  present-at-hand
can belong nevertheless to the ‘past’. But what do we signify by saying of a
world that it is no longer? A world is only in the manner of existing Dasein,
which factically  i s  as Being-in-the-world.(2)
 

1. ‘Vergänglichkeit’. Cf. ‘vergehen’ (‘to pass away’) and ‘Vergangenheit’ (‘the past’).
2. ‘Welt ist nur in der Weise des existierenden Daseins, das als In-der-Welt-sein faktisch ist.’

H. 381

 

Thus the historical character of the antiquities that are still preserved is
grounded  in  the  ‘past’  of  that  Dasein  to  whose  world  they  belonged.  But
according to this, only ‘past’ Dasein would be historical, not Dasein ‘in the
present’. However, can Dasein be past at all, if we define ‘past’ as ‘now no
longer  either  present-at-hand  or  ready-to-hand’?  Manifestly,  Dasein  can
never be past, not because Dasein is non-transient, but because it essentially
can never be present-at-hand. Rather,  if  it is,  it exists.  A Dasein which no
longer  exists,  however,  is  not  past,  in  the  ontologically  strict  sense;  it  is
rather  “having-been-there”  [da-gewesen].  The  antiquities  which  are  still
present-at-hand have a character of ‘the past’ and of history by reason of the
fact  that  they  have  belonged  as  equipment  to  a  world  that  has  been—the
world  of  a  Dasein  that  has  been  there—and  that  they  have  been  derived
from  that  world.  This  Dasein  is  what  is  primarily  historical.  But  does
Dasein  first  become  historical  in  that  it  is  no  longer  there?  Or  is  it  not
historical precisely in so far as it factically exists? Is Dasein just something
that  “has  been”  in  the  sense  of  “having  been  there”,  or  has  it  been  as
something  futural  which  is  making  present—that  is  to  say,  in  the
temporalizing of its temporality?

From  this  provisional  analysis  of  equipment  which  belongs  to  history
and which is still present-at-hand though somehow ‘past’, it becomes plain
that  such  entities  are  historical  only  by  reason  of  their  belonging  to  the
world. But the world has a historical kind of Being because it makes up an
ontological  attribute  of  Dasein.  It  may  be  shown  further  that  when  one
designates a time as ‘the past’, the meaning of this is not unequivocal; but
‘the past’ is manifestly distinct from one’s having been, with which we have
become  acquainted  as  something  constitutive  for  the  ecstatical  unity  of

Dasein’s  temporality.  This,  however,  only  makes  the  enigma  ultimately
more acute; why is it that the historical is determined predominantly by the
‘past’,  or,  to  speak  more  appropriately,  by  the  character  of  having-been,
when that character is one that temporalizes itself equiprimordially with the
Present and the future?

We  contend  that  what  is  primarily  historical  is  Dasein.  That  which  is
secondarily historical,  however,  is  what  we  encounter  within-the-world—
not  only  equipment  ready-to-hand,  in  the  widest  sense,  but  also  the
environing Nature as  ‘the  very  soil  of  history.’  Entities  other  than  Dasein
which are historical by reason of belonging to the world, are what we call
‘world-historical’. It can be shown that the ordinary conception of ‘world-
history’  arises  precisely  from  our  orientation  to  what  is  thus  secondarily
historical. World-historical entities do not first get their historical character,
let us say, by reason of an historiological Objectification; they get it rather
as  those  entities which  they  are  in  themselves  when  they  are  encountered
within-the-world.

In analysing the historical character of equipment which is still present-
at-hand,  we  have  not  only  been  led  back  to  Dasein  as  that  which  is
primarily  historical;  but  at  the  same  time  we  have  been  made  to  doubt
whether  the  temporal  characterization  of  the  historical  in  general  may  be
oriented primarily to the Being-in-time of anything present-at-hand. Entities
do  not  become  ‘more  historical’  by  being  moved  off  into  a  past  which  is
always  farther  and  farther  away,  so  that  the  oldest  of  them  would  be  the
most authentically historical. On the other hand, if the ‘temporal’ distance
from  “now  and  today”  is  of  no  primary  constitutive  significance  for  the
historicality  of  entities  that  are  authentically  historical,  this  is  not  because
these  entities  are  not  ‘in  time’  and  are  timeless,  but  because  they  exist
temporally  in  so  primordial  a  manner  that  nothing  present-at-hand  ‘in
time’,  whether  passing  away  or  still  coming  along,  could  ever—by  its
ontological essence—be temporal in such a way.

H. 382

 

It  will  be  said  that  these  deliberations  have  been  rather  petty.  No  one
denies that at bottom human Dasein is the primary ‘subject’ of history; and
the  ordinary  conception  of  history,  which  we  have  cited,  says  so  plainly
enough. But with the thesis that ‘Dasein is historical’, one has in view not

just  the  ontical  Fact  that  in  man  we  are  presented  with  a  more  or  less
important ‘atom’ in the workings of world-history, and that he remains the
plaything  of  circumstances  and  events.  This  thesis  raises  the  problem:  to
what  extent  and  on  the  basis  of  what  ontological  conditions,  does
historicality belong, as an essential constitutive state, to the subjectivity of
the ‘historical’ subject?

74. The Basic Constitution of Historicality

Dasein factically has its ‘history’, and it can have something of the sort
because the Being of this entity is constituted by historicality. We must now
justify  this  thesis,  with  the  aim  of  expounding  the  ontological problem  of
history as an existential one. The Being of Dasein has been defined as care.
Care is grounded in temporality. Within the range of temporality, therefore,
the  kind  of  historizing  which  gives  existence  its  definitely  historical
character,  must  be  sought.  Thus  the  Interpretation  of  Dasein’s  historicality
will prove to be, at bottom, just a more concrete working out of temporality.
We  first  revealed  temporality  with  regard  to  that  way  of  existing
authentically which we characterized as anticipatory resoluteness. How far
does this imply an authentic historizing of Dasein?

 

 

H. 383

We  have  defined  “resoluteness”  as  a  projecting  of  oneself  upon  one’s
own Being-guilty—a projecting which is reticent and ready for anxiety.(iv)
Resoluteness  gains  its  authenticity  as  anticipatory resoluteness.(v)  In  this,
Dasein  understands  itself  with  regard  to  its  potentiality-for-Being,  and  it
does  so  in  such  a  manner  that  it  will  go  right  under  the  eyes  of  Death  in
order thus to take over in its thrownness that entity which it is itself, and to
take  it  over  wholly.  The  resolute  taking  over  of  one’s  factical  ‘there’,
signifies, at the same time, that the Situation is one which has been resolved
upon.  In  the  existential  analysis  we  cannot,  in  principle,  discuss  what
Dasein factically resolves in any particular case. Our investigation excludes
even  the  existential  projection  of  the  factical  possibilities  of  existence.
Nevertheless,  we  must  ask  whence,  in  general,  Dasein  can  draw  those
possibilities  upon  which  it  factically  projects  itself.  One’s  anticipatory

projection  of  oneself  on  that  possibility  of  existence  which  is  not  to  be
outstripped—on  death—guarantees  only  the  totality  and  authenticity  of
one’s  resoluteness.  But  those  possibilities  of  existence  which  have  been
factically disclosed are not to be gathered from death. And this is still less
the case when one’s anticipation of this possibility does not signify that one
is  speculating  about  it,  but  signifies  precisely  that  one  is  coming  back  to
one’s  factical  “there”.  Will  taking  over  the  thrownness  of  the  Self  into  its
world perhaps disclose a horizon from which existence snatches its factical
possibilities away?(1) Have we not said in addition that Dasein never comes
back  behind  its  thrownness?(vi)  Before  we  decide  too  quickly  whether
Dasein draws it authentic possibilities of existence from thrownness or not,
we must assure ourselves that we have a full conception of thrownness as a
basic attribute of care.
 

iv. Cf. Section 60, H. 295 ff.
v. Cf. Section 62, H. 305 ff.
vi. Cf. H. 284.

1.          ‘Soll  etwa  die  Übernahme  der  Geworfenheit  des  Selbst  in  seine  Welt  einen  Horizont

erschliessen, dem die Existenz ihre faktischen Möglichkeiten entreisst?’

As  thrown,  Dasein  has  indeed  been  delivered  over  to  itself  and  to  its
potentiality-for-Being,  but  as  Being-in-the-world.  As  thrown,  it  has  been
submitted to a ‘world’, and exists factically with Others. Proximally and for
the most part the Self is lost in the “they”. It understands itself in terms of
those possibilities of existence which ‘circulate’ in the ‘average’ public way
of  interpreting  Dasein  today.  These  possibilities  have  mostly  been  made
unrecognizable by ambiguity; yet they are well known to us. The authentic
existentiell  understanding  is  so  far  from  extricating  itself  from  the  way  of
interpreting  Dasein  which  has  come  down  to  us,  that  in  each  case  it  is  in
terms  of  this  interpretation,  against  it,  and  yet  again  for  it,  that  any
possibility one has chosen is seized upon in one’s resolution.

H. 384

The resoluteness in which Dasein comes back to itself, discloses current
factical possibilities of authentic existing, and discloses them in terms of the
heritage  which  that  resoluteness,  as  thrown,  takes  over.  In  one’s  coming

 

 

back  resolutely  to  one’s  thrownness,  there  is  hidden  a  handing  down  to
oneself of the possibilities that have come down to one, but not necessarily
as having  thus  come  down.(1)  If  everything  ‘good’  is  a  heritage,  and  the
character of ‘goodness’ lies in making authentic existence possible, then the
handing  down  of  a  heritage  constitutes  itself  in  resoluteness.  The  more
authentically  Dasein resolves—and  this means that in  anticipating  death it
understands  itself  unambiguously  in  terms  of  its  ownmost  distinctive
possibility—the more unequivocally does it choose and find the possibility
of  its  existence,  and  the  less  does  it  do  so  by  accident.  Only  by  the
anticipation of death is every accidental and ‘provisional’ possibility driven
out.  Only  Being-free  for death,  gives  Dasein  its  goal  outright  and  pushes
existence  into  its  finitude.  Once  one  has  grasped  the  finitude  of  one’s
existence, it snatches one back from the endless multiplicity of possibilities
which  offer  themselves  as  closest  to  one—those  of  comfortableness,
shirking, and taking things lightly—and brings Dasein into the simplicity of
its  fate  [Schicksals].  This  is  how  we  designate  Dasein’s  primordial
historizing, which lies in authentic resoluteness and in which Dasein hands
itself down to  itself,  free  for  death,  in  a  possibility  which  it  has  inherited
and yet has chosen.
 

1.  ‘Die  Entschlossenheit,  in  der  das  Dasein  auf  sich  selbst  zurückkommt,  erschliesst  die
jeweiligen  faktischen  Möglichkeiten  eigentlichen  Existierens  aus  dem  Erbe,  das  sie  als  geworfene
übernimmt.  Das  entschlossene  Zurückkommen  auf  die  Geworfenheit  birgt  ein  Sichüberliefern
überkommener Möglichkeiten in sich, obzwar nicht notwendig als überkommener.’ The grammatical
structure of both sentences is ambiguous. Notice also the counterpoint of the verbs ‘zurückkommen’,
‘überkommen’, ‘überliefern’, ‘übernehmen,’ which cannot be reproduced in translation.

Dasein can be reached by the blows of fate only because in the depths of
its Being Dasein is fate in the sense we have described. Existing fatefully in
the  resoluteness  which  hands  itself  down,  Dasein  has  been  disclosed  as
Being-in-the-world  both  for  the  ‘fortunate’  circumstances which ‘come its
way’  and  for  the  cruelty  of  accidents.  Fate  does  not  first  arise  from  the
clashing  together  of events and circumstances. Even one who is  irresolute
gets driven about by these—more so than one who has chosen; and yet he
can ‘have’ no fate.(1)

If Dasein, by anticipation, lets death become powerful in itself, then, as
free  for  death,  Dasein  understands  itself  in  its  own  superior  power,  the
power  of  its  finite  freedom,  so  that  in  this  freedom,  which  ‘is’  only  in  its
having chosen to make such a choice, it can take over the powerlessness of

abandonment  to  its  having  done  so,  and  can  thus  come  to  have  a  clear
vision  for  the  accidents  of  the  Situation  that  has  been  disclosed.(2)  But  if
fateful  Dasein,  as  Being-in-the-world,  exists  essentially  in  Being-with
Others,  its  historizing  is  a  co-historizing  and  is  determinative  for  it  as
destiny  [Geschick].  This  is  how  we  designate  the  historizing  of  the
community,  of  a  people.  Destiny  is  not  something  that  puts  itself  together
out  of  individual  fates,  any  more  than  Being-with-one-another  can  be
conceived as the occurring together of several Subjects.(vii) Our fates have
already been guided in advance, in our Being with one another in the same
world  and 
in
communicating  and  in  struggling  does  the  power  of  destiny  become  free.
Dasein’s  fateful  destiny  in  and  with  its  ‘generation’(viii)  goes  to  make  up
the full authentic historizing of Dasein.
 

in  our  resoluteness  for  definite  possibilities.  Only

viii. On the concept of the ‘generation’, cf. Wilhelm Dilthey, ‘Über das Studium der Geschichte
der Wissenschaften vom Menschen, der Gesellschaft und dem Staat’ (1875). Gesammelte Schriften,

1.  This  statement  may  well  puzzle  the  English-speaking  reader,  who  would  perhaps  be  less
troubled if he were to read that the irresolute man can have no ‘destiny’. As we shall see in the next
paragraph,  Heidegger  has  chosen  to  differentiate  sharply  between  the  words  ‘Schicksal’  and
‘Geschick’, which are ordinarily synonyms. Thus ‘Schicksal’ (our ‘fate’) might be described as the
‘destiny’  of  the  resolute  individual;  ‘Geschick’  (our  ‘destiny’)  is  rather  the  ‘destiny’  of  a  larger
group,  or  of  Dasein  as  a  member  of  such  a  group.  This  usage  of  ‘Geschick’  is  probably  to  be
distinguished  from  that  which  we  have  met  on  H.  16,  19,  and  perhaps  even  379,  where  we  have
preferred  to  translate  it  by  ‘vicissitude’.  The  suggestion  of  an  etymological  connection  between
‘Schicksal’  and  ‘Geschick’  on  the  one  hand  and  ‘Geschichte’  (our  ‘history’)  and  ‘Geschehen’  (our
‘historizing’) on the other, which is exploited in the next paragraph, is of course lost in translation.

2. ‘Wenn das Dasein vorlaufend den Tod in sich mächtig werden lässt, versteht es sich, frei für
ihn,  in  der  eigenen  Übermacht  seiner  endlichen  Freiheit,  um  in  dieser,  die  je  nur  “ist”  im
Gewählthaben der Wahl, die Ohnmacht der Überlassenheit  an  es  selbst  zu  übernehmen  und  für  die
Zufälle  der  erschlossenen  Situation  hellsichtig  zu  werden.’  It  should  perhaps  be  pointed  out  that
‘Ohnmacht’  can  also  mean  a  ‘faint’  or  a  ‘swoon’,  and  that  ‘Hellsichtigkeit’  is  the  regular  term  for
‘clairvoyance’. Thus the German reader might easily read into this passage a suggestion of the seer’s
mystical trance.

H. 385

 

Fate  is  that powerless superior power  which puts  itself in  readiness  for
adversities—the power of projecting oneself upon one’s own Being-guilty,
and of doing so reticently, with readiness for anxiety. As such, fate requires

as the ontological condition for its possibility, the state of Being of care—
that  is  to  say,  temporality.  Only  if  death,  guilt,  conscience,  freedom,  and
finitude reside together equiprimordially in the Being of an entity as they do
in care, can that entity exist in the mode of fate; that is to say, only then can
it be historical in the very depths of its existence.

Only an entity which, in its Being, is essentially futural so that it is free
for its death and can let itself be thrown back upon its factical “there” by
shattering  itself  against  death—that  is  to  say,  only  an  entity  which,  as
futural, is equiprimordially in the process of having-been, can, by handing
down to itself the possibility it has inherited, take over its own thrownness
and be in the moment of vision for  ‘its  time’.  Only authentic temporality
which is at the same time finite, makes possible something like fate—that is
to say, authentic historicality.

H. 386

 

It  is  not  necessary  that  in  resoluteness  one  should  explicitly  know  the
origin of the possibilities upon which that resoluteness projects itself. It is
rather in Dasein’s temporality, and there only, that there lies any possibility
that the existentiell potentiality-for-Being upon which it projects itself can
be gleaned explicitly from  the  way  in  which Dasein has been traditionally
understood.  The  resoluteness  which  comes  back  to  itself  and  hands  itself
down,  then  becomes  the  repetition  of  a  possibility  of  existence  that  has
come  down  to  us.  Repeating  is  handing  down  explicitly—that  is  to  say,
going  back  into  the  possibilities  of  the  Dasein  that  has-been-there.(1)  The
authentic  repetition  of  a  possibility  of  existence  that  has  been—the
possibility  that  Dasein  may  choose  its  hero—is  grounded  existentially  in
anticipatory resoluteness; for it is in resoluteness that one first chooses the
choice  which  makes  one  free  for  the  struggle  of  loyally  following  in  the
footsteps  of  that  which  can  be  repeated.  But  when  one  has,  by  repetition,
handed  down  to  oneself  a  possibility  that  has  been,  the  Dasein  that  has-
been-there  is  not  disclosed  in  order  to  be  actualized  over  again.  The
repeating  of  that  which  is  possible  does  not  bring  again  [Wiederbringen]
something  that  is  ‘past’,  nor  does  it  bind  the  ‘Present’  back  to  that  which
has  already  been  ‘outstripped’.  Arising,  as  it  does,  from  a  resolute
projection  of  oneself,  repetition  does  not  let  itself  be  persuaded  of

something by what is ‘past’, just in order that this, as something which was
formerly actual, may recur.
 

1.  ‘Die  Wiederholung  ist  die  ausdrückliche  Überlieferung,  das  heisst,  der  Rückgang  in
Möglichkeiten  des  dagewesenen  Daseins’.  (In  the  earlier  editions  the  article  ‘Die’,  as  well  as  the
words now italicized, appears in spaced type.)

While  we  usually  translate  ‘wiederholen’  as  ‘repeat’,  this  English  word  is  hardly  adequate  to
express  Heidegger’s  meaning.  Etymologically,  ‘wiederholen’  means  ‘to  fetch  again’;  in  modern
German  usage,  however,  this  is  expressed  by  the  cognate  separable  verb  ‘wieder...  holen’,  while
‘wiederholen’  means  simply  ‘to  repeat’  or  ‘do  over  again’.  Heidegger  departs  from  both  these
meanings,  as  he  is  careful  to  point  out.  For  him,  ‘wiederholen’  does  not  mean  either  a  mere
mechanical repetition or an attempt to reconstitute the physical past; it means rather an attempt to go
back  to  the  past  and  retrieve  former  possibilities,  which  are  thus  ‘explicitly  handed  down’  or
‘transmitted’.

Rather, the repetition makes a reciprocative rejoinder to  the  possibility
of that existence which has-been-there. But when such a rejoinder is made
to this possibility in a resolution, it is made in a moment of vision; and as
such  it  is  at  the  same  time  a  disavowal  of  that  which  in  the  “today”,  is
working itself out as the ‘past’.(1) Repetition does not abandon itself to that
which is past, nor does it aim at progress. In the moment of vision authentic
existence is indifferent to both these alternatives.
 

1.  ‘Die  Wiederholung  lässt  sich,  einem  entschlossenen  Sichentwerfen  entspringend,  nicht  vom
“Vergangenen”  überreden,  um  es  als  das  vormals  Wirkliche  nur  wiederkehren  zu  lassen.  Die
Wiederholung  erwidert  vielmehr  die  Möglichkeit  der  dagewesenen  Existenz.  Die  Erwiderung  der
Möglichkeit im Entschluss ist aber zugleich als augenblickliche der Widerruf  dessen,  was  in  Heute
sich als “Vergangenheit” auswirkt.’ The idea seems to be that in resolute repetition one is having, as
it were, a conversation with the past, in which the past proposes certain possibilities for adoption, but
in  which  one  makes  a  rejoinder  to  this  proposal  by  ‘reciprocating’  with  the  proposal  of  other
possibilities  as  a  sort  of  rebuke  to  the  past,  which  one  now  disavows.  (The  punning  treatment  of
‘wieder’ and ‘wider’ is presumably intentional.)

We  characterize  repetition  as  a  mode  of  that  resoluteness  which  hands
itself down—the mode by which Dasein exists explicitly as fate. But if fate
constitutes  the  primordial  historicality  of  Dasein,  then  history  has  its
essential  importance  neither  in  what  is  past  nor  in  the  “today”  and  its
‘connection’ with what is past, but in that authentic historizing of existence
which  arises  from  Dasein’s  future.  As  a  way  of  Being  for  Dasein,  history
has  its  roots  so  essentially  in  the  future  that  death,  as  that  possibility  of
Dasein which we have already characterized, throws anticipatory existence
back  upon  its  factical  thrownness,  and  so  for  the  first  time  imparts  to

having-been  its  peculiarly  privileged  position  in  the  historical.  Authentic
Being-towards-death—that  is  to  say,  the  finitude  of  temporality—is  the
hidden  basis  of  Dasein’s  historicality.  Dasein  does  not  first  become
historical  in  repetition;  but  because  it  is  historical  as  temporal,  it  can  take
itself  over  in  its  history  by  repeating.  For  this,  no  historiology  is  as  yet
needed.

Resoluteness  implies  handing  oneself  down  by  anticipation  to  the
“there” of the moment of vision; and this handing down we call “fate”. This
is also the ground for destiny, by which we understand Dasein’s historizing
in  Being-with  Others.  In  repetition,  fateful  destiny  can  be  disclosed
explicitly  as  bound  up  with  the  heritage  which  has  come  down  to  us.  By
repetition,  Dasein  first  has  its  own  history  made  manifest.  Historizing  is
itself  grounded  existentially  in  the  fact  that  Dasein,  as  temporal,  is  open
ecstatically;  so  too  is  the  disclosedness  which  belongs  to  historizing,  or
rather so too is the way in which we make this disclosedness our own.

H. 387

 

That  which  we  have  hitherto  been  characterizing  as  “historicality”  to
conform with the kind of historizing which lies in anticipatory resoluteness,
the
we  now  designate  as  Dasein’s  “authentic  historicality”.  From 
phenomena of handing down and repeating, which are rooted in the future,
it  has  become  plain  why  the  historizing  of  authentic  history  lies
preponderantly  in  having  been.  But  it  remains  all  the  more  enigmatic  in
what way this historizing, as fate, is to constitute the whole ‘connectedness’
of Dasein from its birth to its death. How can recourse to resoluteness bring
us  any  enlightenment?  Is  not  each  resolution  just  one  more  single
‘Experience’  in  the  sequence  of  the  whole  connectedness  of  our
Experiences?  Is  the  ‘connectedness’  of  authentic  historizing  to  consist,  let
us  say,  of  an  uninterrupted  sequence  of  resolutions?  Why  is  it  that  the
question of how the ‘connectedness of life’ is Constituted finds no adequate
and  satisfying  answer?  Is  not  our  investigation  overhasty?  Does  it  not,  in
the  end,  hang  too  much  on  the  answer,  without  first  having  tested  the
legitimacy  of  the  question?  Nothing  is  so  plain  from  the  course  of  the
existential analytic so far, as the Fact that the ontology of Dasein is always
falling back upon  the  allurements of the  way  in  which Being  is  ordinarily
understood. The only way of encountering this fact methodologically is by

studying  the  source  of  the  question  of  how  Dasein’s  connectedness  is
Constituted,  no  matter  how  ‘obvious’  this  question  may  be,  and  by
determining within what ontological horizon it moves.

If  historicality  belongs  to  the  Being  of  Dasein,  then  even  inauthentic
existing  must  be  historical.  What  if  it  is  Dasein’s  inauthentic  historicality
that  has  directed  our  questioning  to  the  ‘connectedness  of  life’  and  has
blocked  off  our  access  to  authentic  historicality  and  its  own  peculiar
‘connectedness’?  However  this  may  be  treated,  we  cannot  do  without  a
study  of  Dasein’s  inauthentic  historicality  if  our  exposition  of  the
ontological problem of history is to be adequate and complete.

75. Dasein’s Historicality, and World-history

 

 

H. 388

Proximally  and  for  the  most  part,  Dasein  understands  itself  in  terms  of
that  which  it  encounters  in  the  environment  and  that  with  which  it  is
circumspectively  concerned.  This  understanding  is  not  just  a  bare  taking
cognizance  of  itself,  such  as  accompanies  all  Dasein’s  ways  of  behaving.
Understanding  signifies  one’s  projecting  oneself  upon  one’s  current
possibility of Being-in-the-world; that is to say, it signifies existing as this
possibility.  Thus  understanding,  as  common  sense,  constitutes  even  the
inauthentic  existence  of  the  “they”.  When  we  are  with  one  another  in
public, our everyday concern does not encounter just equipment and work;
it  likewise  encounters  what  is  ‘given’  along  with  these:  ‘affairs’,
undertakings,  incidents,  mishaps.  The  ‘world’  belongs  to  everyday  trade
and 
traffic  as  the  soil  from  which  they  grow  and  the  arena  where  they  are
displayed.  When  we  are  with  one  another  in  public,  the  Others  are
encountered  in  activity  of  such  a  kind  that  one  is  ‘in  the  swim’  with  it
‘oneself’. One is acquainted with it, discusses it, encourages it, combats it,
retains  it,  and  forgets  it,  but  one  always  does  so  primarily  with  regard  to
what  is  getting  done  and  what  is  ‘going  to  come  of  it’  [was...
“herausspringt”]. We compute the progress which the individual Dasein has
made—his stoppages, readjustments, and ‘output’; and we do so proximally
in  terms  of  that  with  which  he  is  concerned—its  course,  its  status,  its

is  understood 

in  which  Dasein 

changes,  its  availability.  No  matter  how  trivial  it  may  be  to  allude  to  the
way 
in  everyday  common  sense,
ontologically  this  understanding  is  by  no  means  transparent.  But  in  that
case, why should not Dasein’s ‘connectedness’ be defined in terms of what
it is concerned with, and what it ‘Experiences’? Do not equipment and work
and every thing which Dasein dwells alongside, belong to ‘history’ too? If
not, is the historizing of history just the isolated running-off of ‘streams of
Experience’ in individual subjects?

H. 389

 

Indeed history is neither the connectedness of motions in the alterations
of  Objects,  nor  a  free-floating  sequence  of  Experiences  which  ‘subjects’
have had. Does the historizing of history then pertain to the way subject and
Object  are  ‘linked  together’?  Even  if  one  assigns  [zuweist]  historizing  to
the subject-Object relation, we then have to ask what kind of Being belongs
to  this  linkage  as  such,  if  this  is  what  basically  ‘historizes’.  The  thesis  of
Dasein’s  historicality  does  not  say  that  the  worldless  subject  is  historical,
but that what is historical is the entity that exists as Being-in-the-world. The
historizing  of  history  is  the  historizing  of  Being-in-the-world.  Dasein’s
historicality is essentially the historicality of the world, which, on the basis
of  ecstatico-horizontal  temporality,  belongs  to  the  temporalizing  of  that
temporality. In so far as Dasein exists factically, it already encounters that
which  has  been  discovered  within-the-world.  With  the  existence  of
historical Being-in-the-world, what is ready-to-hand and what is present-at-
hand have already, in every case, been incorporated into the history of the
world.  Equipment  and  work—for  instance,  books—have  their  fates;
buildings and institutions have their history. And even Nature is historical.
It is not historical, to be sure, in so far as we speak of ‘natural history’;(ix)
but Nature is historical as a countryside, as an area that has been colonized
or exploited, as a battlefield, or as the site of a cult. These entities within-
the-world  are  historical  as  such,  and  their  history  does  not  signify
something  ‘external’  which  merely  accompanies  the  ‘inner’  history  of  the
‘soul’.  We  call  such  entities  “the  world-historical”.  Here  we  must  notice
that the expression ‘world-history’ which we have chosen and which is here
understood  ontologically,  has  a  double  signification.  The  expression
signifies, for one thing, the historizing of the world in its essential existent

unity with Dasein. At the same time, we have here in view the ‘historizing’
within-the-world of what is ready-to-hand and present-at-hand, in so far as
entities  within-the-world  are,  in  every  case,  discovered  with  the  factically
existent world. The historical world is factical only as the world of entities
within-the-world. That which ‘happens’ with equipment and work as such
has its own character of movement, and this character has been completely
obscure  up  till  now.  When,  for  instance,  a  ring  gets  ‘handed  over’  to
someone  and  ‘worn’,  this  is  a  kind  of  Being  in  which  it  does  not  simply
suffer  changes  of  location.  The  movement  of  historizing  in  which
something ‘happens to something’ is not to be grasped in terms of motion
as  change  of  location.  This  holds  for  all  world-historical  ‘processes’  and
events, and even, in a certain manner, for ‘natural catastrophes’. Quite apart
from  the  fact  that  if  we  were  to  follow  up  the  problem  of  the  ontological
structure  of  world-historical  historizing,  we  would  necessarily  be
transgressing the limits of our theme, we can refrain from this all the more
because  the  very  aim  of  this  exposition  is  to  lead  us  face  to  face  with  the
ontological enigma of the movement of historizing in general.
 

ix.  On  the  question  of  how  ‘natural  happening’  is  to  be  distinguished  ontologically  from  the
movement  of  history,  cf.  the  studies  of  F.  Gottl,  which  for  a  long  time  have  not  been  sufficiently
appreciated: Die Grenzen der Geschichte (1904).
 

We need only delimit that phenomenal range which we necessarily must
also have in view ontologically when we talk of Dasein’s historicality. The
transcendence  of  the  world  has  a  temporal  foundation;  and  by  reason  of
this, the world-historical is, in every case, already ‘Objectively’ there in the
historizing  of  existing  Being-in-the-world,  without  being  grasped
historiologically. And because factical Dasein, in falling, is absorbed in that
with which it concerns itself, it understands its history world-historically in
the first instance. And because, further, the ordinary understanding of Being
understands ‘Being’ as presence-at-hand without further differentiation, the
Being of the world-historical is experienced and interpreted in the sense of
something  present-at-hand  which  comes  along,  has  presence,  and  then
disappears. And finally, because the meaning of Being in general is held to
be something simply self-evident, the question about the kind of Being of
the  world-historical  and  about  the  movement  of  historizing  in  general  has
‘really’ just the barren circumstantiality of a verbal sophistry.

H. 390

 

Everyday Dasein has been dispersed into the many kinds of things which
daily  ‘come  to  pass’.  The  opportunities  and  circumstances  which  concern
keeps  ‘tactically’  awaiting  in  advance,  have  ‘fate’  as  their  outcome.  In
terms  of that with  which inauthentically existing Dasein concerns itself, it
first computes its history. In so doing, it is driven about by its ‘affairs’. So if
it  wants  to  come  to  itself,  it  must  first  pull  itself  together(1)  from  the
dispersion  and  disconnectedness  of  the  very  things  that  have  ‘come  to
pass’; and because of this, it is  only  then  that there at  last  arises from the
horizon of the understanding which belongs to inauthentic historicality, the
question of how one is to establish a ‘connectedness’ of Dasein if one does
so in the sense of ‘Experiences’ of a subject—Experiences which are ‘also’
present-at-hand. The possibility that this horizon for the question should be
the dominant one is grounded in the irresoluteness which goes to make up
the essence of the Self’s in-constancy.
 

1. ‘zusammenholen’. The older editions have ‘z u s a m m e n holen’.

the  question  of 

We  have  thus  pointed  out  the  source  of 

the
‘connectedness’ of Dasein in the sense of the unity with which Experiences
are linked together between birth and death. At the same time, the origin of
this  question  betrays  that  it  is  an  inappropriate  one  if  we  are  aiming  at  a
primordial  existential  Interpretation  of  Dasein’s  totality  of  historizing.  On
the other hand, despite the predominance of this ‘natural’ horizon for such
questions, it becomes explicable why Dasein’s authentic historicality—fate
and  repetition—looks  as  if  it,  least  of  all,  could  supply  the  phenomenal
basis for bringing into the shape of an ontologically grounded problem what
is at bottom intended in the question of the ‘connectedness’ of life.

H. 391

 

This  question  does  not  ask  how  Dasein  gains  such  a  unity  of
connectedness that the sequence of ‘Experiences’ which has ensued and is
still ensuing can subsequently be linked together; it asks rather in which of
its own kinds of Being Dasein loses itself in such a manner(1) that it must,
as  it  were,  only  subsequently  pull  itself  together  out  of  its  dispersal,  and

think  up  for  itself  a  unity  in  which  that  “together”  is  embraced.  Our
lostness in the “they” and in the world-historical has earlier been revealed
as  a  fleeing  in  the  face  of  death.  Such  fleeing  makes  manifest  that  Being-
towards-death  is  a  basic  attribute  of  care.  Anticipatory  resoluteness  brings
this  Being-towards-death  into  authentic  existence.  The  historizing  of  this
resoluteness,  however,  is  the  repetition  of  the  heritage  of  possibilities  by
handing these down to oneself in anticipation; and we have Interpreted this
historizing  as  authentic  historicality.  Is  perhaps  the  whole  of  existence
stretched  along  in  this  historicality  in  a  way  which  is  primordial  and  not
lost,  and  which  has  no  need  of  connectedness?  The  Self’s  resoluteness
against  the  inconstancy  of  distraction,  is  in  itself  a  steadiness  which  has
been  stretched  along—the  steadiness  with  which  Dasein  as  fate
‘incorporates’  into  its  existence  birth  and  death  and  their  ‘between’,  and
holds  them  as  thus  ‘incorporated’,  so  that  in  such  constancy  Dasein  is
indeed  in  a  moment  of  vision  for  what  is  world-historical  in  its  current
Situation.(2)
 

1. ‘...verliert es sich so...’ The older editions have ‘...verliert es sich nicht so...’
2. ‘Die Entschlossenheit des Selbst gegen die Unständigkeit der Zerstreuung ist in sich selbst die
erstreckte  Stätigkeit,  in  der  das  Dasein  als  Schicksal  Geburt  und  Tod  in  ihr  “Zwischen”  in  seine
Existenz “einbezogen” hält, so zwar, dass es in solcher Ständigkeit augenblicklich ist für das Welt-
geschichtliche  seiner  jeweiligen  Situation.’  The  noun  ‘Stätigkeit’,  which  we  here  translate  as
‘steadiness’,  may  mean  either  ‘continuity’  or  ‘refractoriness’.  Heidegger  may  have  both  senses  in
mind. Cf. our note 3, H. 423 below.

In  the  fateful  repetition  of  possibilities  that  have  been,  Dasein  brings
itself  back  ‘immediately’—that  is  to  say,  in  a  way  that  is  temporally
ecstatical—to what already has been before it. But when its heritage is thus
handed  down  to  itself,  its  ‘birth’  is caught  up  into  its  existence in  coming
back  from  the  possibility  of  death  (the  possibility  which  is  not  to  be
outstripped), if only so that this existence may accept the thrownness of its
own “there” in a way which is more free from Illusion.(1)
 

1. ‘Mit diesem Sichüberliefern des Erbes aber ist dann die “Geburt” im Zurückkommen aus der
unüberholbaren  Möglichkeit  des  Todes  in  die  Existenz  eingeholt,  damit  diese  freilich  nur  die
Geworfenheit  des  eigenen  Da  illusionsfreier  hinnehme.’  Here  as  in  H.  307  and  perhaps  in  H.  302,
Heidegger seems to be exploiting the double meaning of ‘einholen’ as ‘to bring in’ and ‘to catch up
with’. Dasein ‘brings’ its birth ‘into’ its existence by accepting its heritage of possibilities, and in this
way it ‘catches up with it’. Thus while death cannot be outstripped (‘überholt’), birth can at least be
‘caught up with’ (‘eingeholt’).

Resoluteness  constitutes  the  loyalty  of  existence  to  its  own  Self.  As
resoluteness  which  is  ready  for  anxiety, this  loyalty  is  at  the  same  time  a
possible way of revering the sole authority which a free existing can have—
of revering the repeatable possibilities of existence. Resoluteness would be
misunderstood ontologically if one were to suppose that it would be actual
as ‘Experience’ only as long as the ‘act’ of resolving ‘lasts’. In resoluteness
lies  the  existentiell  constancy  which,  by  its  very  essence,  has  already
anticipated [vorweggenommen] every possible moment of vision that may
arise  from  it.  As  fate,  resoluteness  is  freedom  to  give  up  some  definite
resolution,  and  to  give  it  up  in  accordance  with  the  demands  of  some
possible  Situation  or  other.  The  steadiness  of  existence  is  not  interrupted
thereby but confirmed in the moment of vision. This steadiness is not first
formed either through or by the adjoining of ‘moments’ one to another; but
these arise from the temporality of that repetition which is futurally in the
process-of-having-been—a  temporality  which  has  already  been  stretched
along.

In inauthentic historicality, on the other hand, the way in which fate has
been primordially stretched along has been hidden. With the inconstancy of
the  they-self  Dasein  makes  present  its  ‘today’.  In  awaiting  the  next  new
thing, it has already forgotten the old one. The “they” evades choice. Blind
for  possibilities,  it  cannot  repeat  what  has  been,  but  only  retains  and
receives the ‘actual’ that is left over, the world-historical that has been, the
leavings, and the information about them that is present-at-hand. Lost in the
making  present  of  the  “today”,  it  understands  the  ‘past’  in  terms  of  the
‘Present’.  On  the  other  hand,  the  temporality  of  authentic  historicality,  as
the moment of vision of anticipatory repetition, deprives the “today” of its
character  as  present,(1)  and  weans  one  from  the  conventionalities  of  the
“they”.  When,  however,  one’s  existence  is  inauthentically  historical,  it  is
loaded down with the legacy of a ‘past’ which has become unrecognizable,
and it seeks the modern. But when historicality is authentic, it understands
history as the ‘recurrence’ of the possible, and knows that a possibility will
recur  only  if  existence  is  open  for  it  fatefully,  in  a  moment  of  vision,  in
resolute repetition.

H. 392

 

The  existential  Interpretation  of  Dasein’s  historicality  is  constantly
getting eclipsed unawares. The obscurities are all the harder to dispel when
we  have  not  disentangled  the  possible  dimensions  of  the  appropriate
inquiry, and when everything is haunted by the enigma of Being, and, as has
now been made plain, by that of motion.(2) Nevertheless, we may venture a
projection of the ontological genesis of historiology as a science in terms of
Dasein’s  historicality.  This  projection  will  serve  to  prepare  us  for  the
clarification  of 
the  history  of  philosophy
historiologically—a  clarification  which  is  to  be  accomplished  in  what

76. The Existential Source of Historiology in Dasein’s Historicality.

We need not discuss the Fact that historiology, like any science, is, as a
kind  of  Being  of  Dasein,  factically  ‘dependent’  at  any  time  on  the
‘prevailing world-view’. Beyond this, we must inquire into the ontological
possibility of how the sciences have their source in Dasein’s state of Being.
This source is still not very transparent. In the context which lies before us,
our  analysis  will  acquaint  us  in  outline  with  the  existential  source  of
historiology  only  to  the  extent  of  bringing  still  more  plainly  to  light  the
historicality  of  Dasein  and  the  fact  that  this  historicality  is  rooted  in
temporality.

If Dasein’s Being is in principle historical, then every factical science is
always  manifestly  in  the  grip  of  this  historizing.  But  historiology  still  has
Dasein’s historicality as its presupposition in its own quite special way.

H. 393

This  can  be  made  plain,  in  the  first  instance,  by  the  suggestion  that
historiology,  as  the  science  of  Dasein’s  history,  must  ‘presuppose’  as  its

 

 

 

itself.  Whether 

in  which  Dasein  comports 

possible  ‘Object’  the  entity  which  is  primordially  historical.  But  history
must  not  only  be,  in  order  that  a  historiological  object  may  become
accessible;  and  historiological  cognition  is  not  only  historical,  as  a
the
historizing  way 
historiological  disclosure  of  history  is  factically  accomplished  or  not,  its
ontological structure is such that in itself this disclosure has its roots in the
historicality  of  Dasein. This  is  the  connection  we  have  in  view  when  we
talk of Dasein’s historicality as the existential source of historiology. To cast
light  upon  this  connection  signifies  methodologically  that  the  idea  of
historiology  must  be  projected  ontologically 
terms  of  Dasein’s
historicality.  The  issue  here  is  not  one  of  ‘abstracting’  the  concept  of
historiology  from  the  way  something  is  factically  done  in  the  sciences
today,  nor  is  it  one  of  assimilating  it  to  anything  of  this  sort.  For  what
guarantee do we have in principle that such a factical procedure will indeed
be  properly  representative  of  historiology  in  its  primordial  and  authentic
possibilities? And even if this should turn out to be the case—we shall hold
back from any decision about this—then the concept could be ‘discovered’
in  the  Fact  only  by  using  the  clue  provided  by  the  idea  of  historiology  as
one  which  we  have  already  understood.  On  the  other  hand,  the  existential
idea  of  historiology  is  not  given  a  higher  justification  by  having  the
historian affirm that his factical behaviour is in agreement with it. Nor does
the idea become ‘false’ if he disputes any such agreement.

in 

is 

thematizing.  That  which 

The  idea  of  historiology  as  a  science  implies  that  the  disclosure  of
historical entities is what it has seized upon as its own task. Every science is
constituted  primarily  by 
familiar
prescientifically  in  Dasein  as  disclosed  Being-in-the-world,  gets  projected
upon  the  Being  which  is  specific  to  it.  With  this  projection,  the  realm  of
entities  is  bounded  off.  The  ways  of  access  to  them  get  ‘managed’
methodologically,  and  the  conceptual  structure  for  interpreting  them  is
outlined.  If  we  may  postpone  the  question  of  whether  a  ‘history  of  the
Present’  is  possible,  and  assign  [zuweisen]  to  historiology  the  task  of
disclosing  the  ‘past’,  then  the  historiological  thematizing  of  history  is
possible  only  if,  in  general,  the  ‘past’  has  in  each  case  already  been
disclosed.  Quite  apart  from  the  question  of  whether  sufficient  sources  are
available for the historiological envisagement of the past, the way to it must
in  general  be  open if  we  are  to  go  back  to  it  historiologically.  It  is  by  no
means patent that anything of the sort is the case, or how this is possible.

But in so far as Dasein’s Being is historical—that is to say, in so far as by
reason  of  its  ecstatico-horizonal  temporality  it  is  open  in  its  character  of
“having-been”—the way is in general prepared for such thematizing of the
‘past’ as can be accomplished in existence. And because Dasein, and  only
Dasein,  is  primordially  historical,  that  which  historiological  thematizing
presents  as  a  possible  object  for  research,  must  have  the  kind  of  Being  of
Dasein which has-been-there. Along  with  any  factical  Dasein  as  Being-in-
the-world,  there  is also,  in  each  case,  world-history.  If  Dasein  is  there  no
longer,  then  the  world  too  is  something  that  has-been-there.  This  is  not  in
conflict  with  the  fact  that,  all  the  same,  what  was  formerly  ready-to-hand
within-the-world  does  not  yet  pass  away,  but  becomes  something  that  one
can,  in  a  Present,  come  across  ‘historiologically’  as  something  which  has
not passed away and which belongs to the world that has-been-there.

H. 394

 

Remains,  monuments,  and  records  that  are  still  present-at-hand,  are
possible  ‘material’  for  the  concrete  disclosure  of  the  Dasein  which  has-
been-there. Such things can turn into historiological material only because,
in  accordance  with  their  own  kind  of  Being,  they  have  a  world-historical
character.  And  they  become  such  material  only  when  they  have  been
understood  in  advance  with  regard  to  their  within-the-world-ness.  The
world that has already been projected is given a definite character by way of
an  Interpretation  of  the  world-historical  material  we  have  ‘received’.  Our
going  back  to  ‘the  past’  does  not  first  get  its  start  from  the  acquisition,
sifting, and securing of such material; these activities presuppose historical
Being  towards  the  Dasein  that  has-been-there—that  is  to  say,  they
presuppose  the  historicality  of  the  historian’s  existence.  This  is  the
existential foundation for historiology as a science, even for its most trivial
and ‘mechanical’ procedures.(xi)

If  historiology  is  rooted  in  historicality  in  this  manner,  then  it  is  from
here that we must determine what the object of historiology ‘really’ is. The
delimitation of the primordial theme of historiology will have to be carried
through  in  conformity  with  the  character  of  authentic  historicality  and  its
disclosure  of  “what-has-been-there”—that  is  to  say,  in  conformity  with
repetition as this disclosure. In repetition the Dasein which has-been-there
is  understood  in  its  authentic  possibility  which  has  been.  The  ‘birth’  of

historiology from authentic historicality therefore signifies that in taking as
our  primary  theme  the  historiological  object  we  are  projecting  the  Dasein
which  has-been-there  upon  its  ownmost  possibility  of  existence.  Is
historiology  thus  to  have  the  possible  for  its  theme?  Does  not  its  whole
‘meaning’ point solely to the ‘facts’—to how something has factually been?
But  what  does  it  signify  to  say  that  Dasein  is  ‘factual’?  If  Dasein  is
‘really’ actual only in existence, then its ‘factuality’ is constituted precisely
by its resolute projection of itself upon a chosen potentiality-for-Being. But
if  so,  that  which  authentically  has-been-there  ‘factually’  is  the  existentiell
possibility  in  which  fate,  destiny,  and  world-history  have  been  factically
determined. Because in each case existence  i s  only  as  factically  thrown,
historiology  will  disclose  the  quiet  force  of  the  possible  with  greater
penetration  the  more  simply  and  the  more  concretely  having-been-in-the-
world is understood in terms of its possibility, and ‘only’ presented as such.

If historiology, which itself arises from authentic historicality, reveals by
repetition the Dasein which has-been-there and reveals it in its possibility,
then historiology has already made manifest the ‘universal’ in the once-for-
all.  The  question  of  whether  the  object  of  historiology  is  just  to  put  once-
for-all ‘individual’ events into a series, or whether it also has ‘laws’ as its
objects,  is  one  that  is  radically  mistaken.  The  theme  of  historiology  is
neither  that  which  has  happened  just  once  for  all  nor  something  universal
that floats above it, but the possibility which has been factically existent.(1)
This possibility does not get repeated as such—that is to say, understood in
an  authentically  historiological  way—if  it  becomes  perverted  into  the
colourlessness  of  a  supratemporal  model.  Only  by  historicality  which  is
factical and authentic can the history of what has-been-there, as a resolute
fate,  be  disclosed  in  such  a  manner  that  in  repetition  the  ‘force’  of  the
possible gets struck home into one’s factical existence—in other words, that
it comes towards that existence in its futural character. The historicality of
unhistoriological Dasein does not take its departure from the ‘Present’ and
from what is ‘actual’ only today, in order to grope its way back from there

to something that is past; and neither does historiology. Even historiological
disclosure temporalizes itself in terms of the future. The ‘selection’ of what
is to become a possible object for historiology has already been met with in
in  which
the  factical  existentiell  choice  of  Dasein’s  historicality, 
historiology first of all arises, and in which alone it is.
 

1.  ‘Weder  das  nur  einmalig  Geschehene  noch  ein  darüber  schwebendes  Allgemeines  ist  ihr

Thema, sondern die faktisch existent gewesene Möglichkeit.’

The historiological disclosure of the ‘past’ is based on fateful repetition,
and is so far from ‘subjective’ that it alone guarantees the ‘Objectivity’ of
historiology. For the Objectivity of a science is regulated primarily in terms
of whether that science can confront us with the entity which belongs to it
as its theme, and can bring it, uncovered in the primordiality of its Being, to
our  understanding.  In  no  science  are  the  ‘universal  validity’  of  standards
and  the  claims  to  ‘universality’  which  the  “they”  and  its  common  sense
demand, less possible as criteria of ‘truth’ than in authentic historiology.

Only  because  in  each  case  the  central  theme  of  historiology  is  the
possibility of  existence  which  has-been-there,  and  because  the  latter  exists
factically in a way which is world-historical, can it demand of itself that it
takes  its  orientation  inexorably  from  the  ‘facts’.  Accordingly  this  research
as  factical  has  many  branches  and  takes  for  its  object  the  history  of
equipment, of work, of culture, of the spirit, and of ideas. As handing itself
down,  history  is,  in  itself,  at  the  same  time  and  in  each  case  always  in  an
interpretedness which belongs to it, and which has a history of its own; so
for  the  most  part  it  is  only  through  traditional  history  that  historiology
penetrates to what has-been-there itself. This is why concrete historiological
research  can,  in  each  case,  maintain  itself  in  varying  closeness  to  its
authentic  theme.  If  the  historian  ‘throws’  himself  straightway  into  the
‘world-view’ of an era, he has not thus proved as yet that he understands his
object in an authentically historical way, and not just ‘aesthetically’. And on
the other hand, the existence of a historian who ‘only’ edits sources, may be
characterized by a historicality which is authentic.

H. 396

 

Thus  the  very  prevalence  of  a  differentiated  interest  even  in  the  most
remote  and  primitive  cultures,  is  in  itself  no  proof  of  the  authentic
historicality  of  a  ‘time’.  In  the  end,  the  emergence  of  a  problem  of
‘historicism’  is  the  clearest  symptom  that  historiology  endeavours  to
alienate  Dasein  from  its  authentic  historicality.  Such  historicality  does  not
necessarily require historiology. It is not the case that unhistoriological eras
as such are unhistorical also.

The possibility that historiology in general can either be ‘used’ ‘for one’s
life’ or ‘abused’ in it, is grounded on the fact that one’s life is historical in
the  roots  of  its  Being,  and  that  therefore,  as  factically  existing,  one  has  in
each  case  made  one’s  decision  for  authentic  or  inauthentic  historicality.
Nietzsche  recognized  what  was  essential  as  to  the  ‘use  and  abuse  of
historiology for life’ in the second of his studies “out of season” (1874), and
said  it  unequivocally  and  penetratingly.  He  distinguished  three  kinds  of
historiology—the  monumental,  the  antiquarian,  and  the  critical—without
explicitly pointing out the necessity of this triad or the ground of its unity.
The threefold character of historiology is adumbrated in the historicality of
Dasein. At the same time, this historicality enables us to understand to what
extent  these  three  possibilities  must  be  united  factically  and  concretely  in
any  historiology  which  is  authentic.  Nietzsche’s  division  is  not  accidental.
The beginning of his ‘study’ allows us to suppose that he understood more
than he has made known to us.

H. 397

 

As  historical,  Dasein  is  possible  only  by  reason  of  its  temporality,  and
temporality  temporalizes  itself  in  the  ecstatico-horizonal  unity  of  its
raptures.  Dasein  exists  authentically  as  futural  in  resolutely  disclosing  a
possibility  which  it  has  chosen.  Coming  back  resolutely  to  itself  it  is,  by
repetition, open for the ‘monumental’ possibilities of human existence. The
historiology which arises from such historicality is ‘monumental’. As in the
process of having been, Dasein has been delivered over to its thrownness.
When the possible is made one’s own by repetition, there is adumbrated at
the same time the possibility of reverently preserving the existence that has-
been-there, in which the possibility seized upon has become manifest. Thus
authentic  historiology,  as  monumental,  is  ‘antiquarian’  too.  Dasein
temporalizes itself in the way the future and having been are united in the

Present.  The  Present  discloses  the  “today”  authentically,  and  of  course  as
the moment of vision. But in so far as this “today” has been interpreted in
terms  of  understanding  a  possibility  of  existence  which  has  been  seized
upon—an understanding which is repetitive in a futural manner—authentic
historiology  becomes  a  way  in  which  the  “today”  gets  deprived  of  its
character  as  present;  in  other  words,  it  becomes  a  way  of  painfully
detaching oneself from the falling publicness of the ‘today”. As authentic,
the historiology which is both monumental and antiquarian is necessarily a
critique  of  the  ‘Present’.  Authentic  historicality  is  the  foundation  for  the
possibility  of  uniting  these  three  ways  of  historiology.  But  the  ground on
which  authentic  historiology  is  founded  is  temporality  as  the  existential
meaning of the Being of care.

The  existential-historical  source  of  historiology  may  be  presented
concretely  by  analysing  the  thematization  which  is  constitutive  for  this
science.  In  historiological  thematizing,  the  main  point  is  the  cultivation  of
the  hermeneutical  Situation  which—once  the  historically  existent  Dasein
has  made  its  resolution—opens  itself  to  the  repetitive  disclosure  of  what
has-been-there. The possibility and the structure of historiological truth are
to  be  expounded  in  terms  of  the  authentic  disclosedness  (‘truth’)  of
historical  existence.  But  since  the  basic  concepts  of  the  historiological
sciences—whether  they  pertain  to  the  Objects  of  these  sciences  or  to  the
way in which these are treated—are concepts of existence, the theory of the
humane  science  presupposes  an  existential  Interpretation  which  has  as  its
theme the historicality of Dasein. Such an Interpretation is the constant goal
to  which  the  researches  of  Wilhelm  Dilthey  seek  to  bring  us  closer,  and
which  gets  illumined  in  a  more  penetrating  fashion  by  the  ideas  of  Count
Yorck von Wartenburg.

77.  The  Connection  of  the  Foregoing  Exposition  of  the  Problem  of
Historicality  with  the  Researches  of  Wilhelm  Dilthey  and  the  Ideas  of
Count Yorck
 

1. In this section we have relaxed some of our usual conventions in view of the special stylistic
character  of  the  quotations  from  Count  Yorck  and  Heidegger’s  own  minor  inconsistencies  in
punctuation.  In  particular,  we  shall  now  translate  ‘Historie’  as  ‘History’  with  a  capital  ‘H’,  rather
than as ‘historiology.’

The  analysis  of  the  problem  of  history  which  we  have  just  carried
through has arisen in the process of appropriating the labours of Dilthey. It
has been corroborated and at the same time strengthened, by the theses of
Count Yorck, which are found scattered through his letters to him.(xii)

The image of Dilthey which is still widely disseminated today is that of
the ‘sensitive’ interpreter of the history of the spirit, especially the history
of literature, who ‘also’ endeavours to distinguish between the natural and
the  humane  sciences,  thereby  assigning  [zuweist]  a  distinctive  role  to  the
history of the latter group and likewise to ‘psychology’, then allowing the
whole  to  merge  together  in  a  relativistic  ‘philosophy  of  life’.  Considered
superficially,  this  sketch  is  ‘correct’.  But  the  ‘substance’  eludes  it,  and  it
covers up more than it reveals.

H. 398

 

We  may  divide  Dilthey’s  researches  schematically  into  three  domains:
studies  on  the  theory  of  the  humane  sciences,  and  the  distinction  between
these and the natural sciences; researches into the history of the sciences of
man, society, and the state; endeavours towards a psychology in which the
‘whole  fact  of  man’  is  to  be  presented.  Investigations  in  the  theory  of
science,  in  historical  science,  and  in  psychological  hermeneutics  are
constantly permeating and intersecting each other. Where any one point of
view  predominates,  the  others  are  the  motives  and  the  means.  What  looks
like  disunity  and  an  unsure,  ‘haphazard’  way  of  ‘trying  things  out’,  is  an
elemental  restlessness,  the  one  goal  of  which  is  to  understand  ‘life’
philosophically  and  to  secure  for  this  understanding  a  hermeneutical
foundation  in  terms  of  ‘life  itself’.  Everything  centres  in  psychology,  in
which ‘life’ is to be understood in the historical context of its development
and  its  effects,  and  understood  as  the  way  in  which  man,  as  the  possible
object of the humane sciences, and especially as the root of these sciences,
is. Hermeneutics  is  the  way  this  understanding  enlightens  itself;  it  is  also
the methodology of historiology, though only in a derivative form.

In the contemporaneous discussions, Dilthey’s own researches for laying
the basis for the humane sciences were forced one-sidedly into the field of

the  theory  of  science;  and  it  was  of  course  with  a  regard  for  such
discussions  that  his  publications  were  often  oriented  in  this  direction.  But
the  ‘logic  of  the  humane  sciences’  was  by  no  means  central  for  him—no
more  than  he  was  striving  in  his  ‘psychology’  ‘merely’  to  make
improvements in the positive science of the psychical.

Dilthey’s  friend,  Count  Yorck,  gives  unambiguous  expression  to
Dilthey’s ownmost philosophical tendency in the communications between
them,  when  he  alludes  to  ‘our  common  interest  in  understanding
historicality’ (italicized  by  the  author).(xiii)  Dilthey’s  researches  are  only
now  becoming  accessible  in  their  full  scope;  if  we  are  to  make  them  our
own, we need the steadiness and concreteness of coming to terms with them
in  principle.  This  not  the  place  [Ort]  for  discussing  in  detail  the  problems
which moved him, or how he was moved by them.(xiv) We shall, however,
describe  in  a  provisional  way  some  of  Count  Yorck’s  central  ideas,  by
selecting characteristic passages from the letters.
 

xiii. Briefwechsel, p. 185.
xiv.  We  can  forgo  this  all  the  more  because  we  are  indebted  to  G.  Misch  for  a  concrete
presentation  of  Dilthey  which  is  aimed  at  his  central  tendencies,  and  which  is  indispensable  for
coming to terms with Dilthey’s work. Cf. his introduction to Wilhelm Dilthey, Gesammelte Schriften,
vol. V (1924), pp. vii-cxvii.

H. 399

 

In these communications, Yorck’s own tendency is brought to life by the
labours of Dilthey and his ways of formulating questions, and it shows itself
when Yorck takes his stand as to the tasks of the discipline which is to lay
the basis—analytical psychology. On Dilthey’s Academy paper, ‘Ideen über
eine beschreibende und zergliedernde Psycholgie’ (1894), he writes: ‘It gets
firmly laid down that the consideration of the Self is the primary means of
knowing, and that the primary procedure of knowing is analysis. From this
standpoint  principles  get  formulated  which  are  verified  by  their  own
findings. No progress is made towards critically breaking down constructive
psychology and its assumptions, or towards explaining it and  thus  refuting
it from within’ (Briefwechsel, p. 177). ‘...your disregard for breaking things
down 
their  provenience
psychologically, and carrying this out trenchantly in detail) is connected, in
my opinion, with your conception of the theory of knowledge and with the

for  demonstrating 

critically 

(that 

is, 

position  which  you  assign  [zuweisen]  to  it’  (p.  177).  ‘...only  a  theory  of
knowledge  gives  the explanation for  this  inapplicability  (the  fact  of  it  has
been laid down and made plain). It has to render account for the adequacy
of scientific methods; it has to provide the grounds for a doctrine of method,
instead  of  having  its  methods  taken—at  a  venture,  I  must  say—from
particular areas’ (pp. 179 f.).

At  bottom  Yorck  is  demanding  a  logic  that  shall  stride  ahead  of  the
sciences  and  guide  them,  as  did  the  logic  of  Plato  and  Aristotle;  and  this
demand  includes  the  task  of  working  out,  positively  and  radically,  the
different  categorial  structures  of  those  entities  which  are  Nature  and  of
those which are history  (Dasein).  Yorck  finds  that  Dilthey’s  investigations
‘put  too  little  stress  on  differentiation  generically  between  the  ontical  and
the  Historical’  (p.  191,  italicized  by  the  author).  ‘In  particular,  the
procedure  of  comparison  is  claimed  to  be  the  method  for  the  humane
sciences.  Here  I  disagree  with  you...  Comparison  is  always  aesthetic,  and
always  adheres  to  the  pattern  of  things.  Windelband  assigns  [weist...  zu]
patterns to history. Your concept of the type is an entirely inward one. Here
it is a matter of characteristics, not of patterns. For Windelband, history is a
series  of  pictures,  of  individual  patterns—an  aesthetic  demand.  To  the
natural  scientist,  there  remains,  beside  his  science,  as  a  kind  of  human
tranquillizer,  only  aesthetic  enjoyment.  But  your  conception  of  history  is
that  of  a  nexus  of  forces,  of  unities  of  force,  to  which  the  category  of
“pattern” is to be applicable only by a kind of transference’ (p. 193).

H. 400

 

In terms of his sure instinct for ‘differentiating between the ontical and
the Historical’, Yorck knew how strongly traditional historical research still
maintains itself in ‘purely ocular ways of ascertaining’ (p. 192), which  are
aimed at the corporeal and at that which has pattern.

‘Ranke  is  a  great  ocularist,  for  whom  things  that  have  vanished  can
the
never  become  actualities...  Ranke’s  whole 
explanation  for  the  way  the  material  of  history  has  been  restricted  to  the
political.  Only  the  political  is  dramatic’  (p.  60).  ‘The  modifications  which
the course of time has brought appear unessential to me, and I should like to
appraise this very differently. For instance, I regard the so-called Historical
school as a mere sidestream within the same river-bed, and as representing

tribe  also  provides 

only  one  branch  of  an  old  and  thoroughgoing  opposition.  The  name  is
somewhat  deceptive.  That  school  was  by  no  means  a  Historical  one
(italicized  by  the  author),  but  an  antiquarian  one,  construing  things
aesthetically,  while  the  great  dominating  activity  was  one  of  mechanical
construction.  Hence  what  it  contributed  methodologically—to  the  method
of rationality—was only a general feeling’ (pp. 68 f.).

H. 401

 

‘The  genuine  Philologus—he  conceives  of  History  as  a  cabinet  of
antiquities.(1)  Where  nothing  is  palpable—whither  one  has  been  guided
only  by  a  living  psychical  transposition—these  gentlemen  never  come.  At
heart  they  are  natural  scientists,  and  they  become  sceptics  all  the  more
because  experimentation  is  lacking.  We  must  keep  wholly  aloof  from  all
such  rubbish,  for  instance,  as  how  often  Plato  was  in  Magna  Graecia  or
Syracuse. On this nothing vital depends. This superficial affectation which I
have seen through critically, winds up at last with a big question-mark and
is  put  to  shame  by  the  great  Realities  of  Homer,  Plato,  and  the  New
Testament. Everything that is actually Real becomes a mere phantom when
one considers it as a “Thing in itself”—when it does not get Experienced’
(p. 61). ‘These “scientists” stand over against the powers of the times like
the  over-refined  French  society  of  the  revolutionary  period.  Here  as  there,
formalism, the cult of the form; the defining of relationship is the last word
in  wisdom.  Naturally,  thought  which  runs  in  this  direction  has  its  own
history,  which,  I  suppose,  is  still  unwritten.  The  groundlessness  of  such
thinking  and  of  any  belief  in  it  (and  such  thinking,  epistemologically
considered,  is  a  metaphysical  attitude)  is  a  Historical  product’  (p.  39).  ‘It
seems to me that the ground-swells evoked by the principle of eccentricity,
(2) which led to a new era more than four hundred years ago, have become
exceedingly broad and flat; that our knowledge has progressed to the point
of cancelling itself out; that man has withdrawn so far from himself that he
no longer sees himself at all. The “modern man”—that is to say, the post-
Renaissance  man—is  ready  for  burial’  (p.  83).  On  the  other  hand,  “All
History that is truly alive and not just reflecting a tinge of life, is a critique’
(p.  19).  ‘But  historical  knowledge  is,  for  the  best  part,  knowledge  of  the
hidden sources’ (p. 109). ‘With history, what makes a spectacle and catches
the eye is not the main thing. The nerves are invisible, just as the essentials

in general are invisible. While it is said that “if you were quiet, you would
be strong”, the variant is also true that “if you are quiet, you will perceive—
that is, understand” ’ (p. 26). ‘And then I enjoy the quietude of soliloquizing
and  communing  with  the  spirit  of  history.  This  spirit  is  one  who  did  not
appear  to  Faust  in  his  study,  or  to  Master  Goethe  either.  But  they  would
have felt no alarm in making way for him, however grave and compelling
such an apparition might be. For he is brotherly, akin to us in another and
deeper  sense  than  are  the  denizens  of  bush  and  field.  These  exertions  are
like  Jacob’s  wrestling—a  sure  gain  for  the  wrestler  himself.  Indeed  this  is
what matters first of all’ (p. 133).

platonischen Philosophie (Heidelberg, 1839) he has been reading.

H. 402

 

Yorck  gained  his  clear  insight  into  the  basic  character  of  history  as
‘virtuality’ from his knowledge of the character of the Being which human
Dasein itself possesses, not from the Objects of historical study, as a theory
of science would demand. ‘The entire psycho-physical datum is not one that
is  (Here  “Being”  equals  the  Being-present-at-hand  of  Nature.—Author’s
remark) but one that lives; this is the germinal point of historicality.(1) And
if  the  consideration  of the  Self  is  directed not  at  an abstract “I”  but  at  the
fulness of my Self, it will find me Historically determined, just as physics
knows me as cosmically determined. Just as I am Nature, so I am history...’
(p. 71). And Yorck, who saw through all bogus ‘defining of relationships’
and  ‘groundless’  relativisms,  did  not  hesitate  to  draw  the  final  conclusion
from his insight into the historicality of Dasein. ‘But, on the other hand, in
view  of  the  inward  historicality  of  self-consciousness,  a  systematic  that  is
divorced  from  History  is  methodologically  inadequate.  Just  as  physiology
cannot be studied in abstraction from physics, neither can philosophy from
historicality—especially  if  it  is  a  critical  philosophy.  Behaviour  and
historicality  are  like  breathing  and  atmospheric  pressure;  and—this  may
sound  rather  paradoxical—it  seems  to  me  methodologically  like  a  residue
from metaphysics not to historicize one’s philosophizing’ (p. 69). ‘Because
to  philosophize  is  to  live,  there  is,  in  my  opinion  (do  not  be  alarmed!),  a

philosophy of history—but who would be able to write it? Certainly it is not
the sort of thing it has hitherto been taken to be, or the sort that has so far
been attempted; you have declared yourself incontrovertibly against all that.
Up till now, the question has been formulated in a way which is false, even
impossible; but this is not the only way of formulating it. Thus there is no
longer  any  actual  philosophizing  which  would  not  be  Historical.  The
separation  between  systematic  philosophy  and  Historical  presentation  is
essentially incorrect’ (p. 251). ‘That a science can become practical is now,
of course, the real basis for its justification. But the mathematical praxis is
not  the  only  one.  The  practical  aim  of  our  standpoint  is  one  that  is
pedagogical in the broadest and deepest sense of the word. Such an aim is
the soul of all true philosophy, and the truth of Plato and Aristotle’ (pp. 42
f.). ‘You know my views on the possibility of ethics as a science. In spite of
that, this can always be done a little better. For whom are such books really
written? Registries about registries! The only thing worthy of notice is what
drives  them  to  come  from  physics  to  ethics’  (p.  73).  ‘If  philosophy  is
conceived  as  a  manifestation  of  life,  and  not  as  the  coughing  up  of  a
baseless kind of thinking (and such thinking appears baseless because one’s
glance gets turned away from the basis of consciousness), then one’s task is
as meagre in its results as it is complicated and arduous in the obtaining of
them. Freedom from prejudice is what it presupposes, and such freedom is
hard to gain’ (p. 250).
 

1.  Yorck’s  text  reads  as  follows:  ‘Das  die  gesammte  psychophysische  Gegebenheit  nicht    i  s  t
  sondern  lebt,  ist  der  Keimpunkt  der  Geschichtlichkeit’.  Heidegger  plausibly  changes  ‘Das’  to
‘...dass’ in the earlier editions, to ‘Dass’ in the later ones.

H. 403

 

It is plain from Yorck’s allusion to the kind of difficulty met with in such
investigations,  that  he  himself  was  already  on  the  way  to  bringing  within
our grasp categorially the Historical as opposed to the ontical (ocular), and
to  raising  up  ‘life’  into  the  kind  of  scientific  understanding  that  is
appropriate  to  it.  The  aesthetico-mechanistic  way  of  thinking(1)  ‘finds
verbal  expression  more  easily  than  does  an  analysis  that  goes  behind
intuition, and this can be explained by the wide extent to which words have
their  provenience  in  the  ocular...  On  the  other  hand,  that  which  penetrates
into  the  basis  of  vitality  eludes  an  exoteric  presentation;  hence  all  its

terminology  is  symbolic  and  ineluctable,  not  intelligible  to  all.  Because
philosophical  thinking  is  of  a  special  kind,  its  linguistic  expression  has  a
special  character’  (pp.  70  f.).  ‘But  you  are  acquainted  with  my  liking  for
paradox, which I justify by saying that paradoxicality is a mark of truth, and
that the communis  opinio  is  nowhere  in  the  truth,  but  is  like  an  elemental
precipitate of a halfway understanding which makes generalizations; in its
relationship  to  truth  it  is  like  the  sulphurous  fumes  which  the  lightning
leaves  behind.  Truth  is  never  an  element.  To  dissolve  elemental  public
opinion,  and,  as  far  as  possible,  to  make  possible  the  moulding  of
individuality  in  seeing  and  looking,  would  be  a  pedagogical  task  for  the
state. Then, instead of a so-called public conscience—instead of this radical
externalization—individual  consciences—that  is  to  say,  consciences—
would again become powerful’ (pp. 249 f.).
 

1.  Yorck  is  here  discussing  Lotze  and  Fechner,  and  suggesting  that  their  ‘rare  talent  for
expression’ was abetted by their ‘aesthetico-mechanistic way of thinking’, as Heidegger calls it. The
reader  who  is  puzzled  by  the  way  Yorck  lumps  together  the  ‘aesthetic’,  the  ‘mechanistic’,  and  the
‘intuitive’, should bear in mind that here the words ‘aesthetic’ and ‘intuition’ are used in the familiar
Kantian  sense  of  immediate  sensory  experience,  and  that  Yorck  thinks  of  ‘mechanism’  as  falling
entirely within the ‘horizon’ of such experience without penetrating beyond it.

the  ontical,  and  conceive 

If one has an interest in understanding historicality, one is brought to the
task  of  working  out  a  ‘generic  differentiation  between  the  ontical  and  the
Historical’.  The  fundamental  aim  of  the  ‘philosophy  of  life’(1)  is  tied  up
with  this.  Nevertheless,  the  formulation  of  the  question  needs  to  be
radicalized  in  principle.  How  are  we  to  get  historicality  into  our  grasp
philosophically  as  distinguished  from 
it
‘categorially’, except by bringing both the ‘ontical’ and the ‘Historical’ into
a more primordial unity, so  that  they  can  be  compared  and  distinguished?
But  that  is  possible  only  if  we  attain  the  following  insights:  (1)  that  the
question of historicality is an ontological question about the state of Being
of  historical  entities;  (2)  that  the  question  of  the  ontical  is  the  ontological
question  of  the  state  of  Being  of  entities  other  than  Dasein—of  what  is
present-at-hand in the widest sense; (3) that the ontical is only one domain
of  entities.  The  idea  of  Being  embraces  both  the  ‘ontical’  and  the
‘Historical’.  It  is  this  idea  which  must 
itself  be  ‘generically
differentiated’.

It is not by chance that Yorck calls those entities which are not historical,
simply  the  “ontical”.  This  just  reflects  the  unbroken  dominion  of  the
traditional ontology, which, as derived from the ancient way of formulating
the  question  of  Being,  narrows  down  the  ontological  problematic  in
principle  and  holds  it  fact.  The  problem  of  differentiating  between  the
ontical and the  Historical  cannot be worked  out  as a problem  for  research
unless we  have made  sure in  advance what is  the  clue to  it,  by clarifying,
through  fundamental  ontology,  the  question  of  the  meaning  of  Being  in
general.(xv)  Thus  it  becomes  plain  in  what  sense  the  preparatory
existential-temporal  analytic  of  Dasein  is  resolved  to  foster  the  spirit  of
Count Yorck in the service of Dilthey’s work.

VI: TEMPORALITY AND WITHIN-TIME-NESS AS THE

SOURCE OF THE ORDINARY CONCEPTION OF TIME

 

Dasein
 

78.  The  Incompleteness  of  the  Foregoing  Temporal  Analysis  of

To  demonstrate  that  temporality  is  constitutive  for  Dasein’s  Being  and
how  it  is  thus  constitutive,  we  have  shown  that  historicality,  as  a  state-of-
Being  which  belongs  to  existence,  is  ‘at  bottom’  temporality.  We  have
carried  through  our  Interpretation  of  the  temporal  character  of  history
without  regard  for  the  ‘fact’  that  all  historizing  runs  its  course  ‘in  time’.
Factically,  in  the  everyday  understanding  of  Dasein,  all  history  is  known
merely  as  that  which  happens  ‘within-time’;  but  throughout  the  course  of
our  existential-temporal  analysis  of  historicality,  this  understanding  has
been  ruled  out  of  order.  If  the  existential  analytic  is  to  make  Dasein
ontologically  transparent  in  its  very  facticity,  then  the  factical  ‘ontico-
temporal’ interpretation of history must also be explicitly given its due. It is
all  the  more  necessary  that  the  time  ‘in  which’  entities  are  encountered
should be analysed in principle, since not only history but natural processes
too are determined ‘by time’. But still more elemental than the circumstance
that  the  ‘time  factor’  is  one  that  occurs  in  the  sciences  of  history  and
Nature,  is  the  Fact  that  before  Dasein  does  any  thematical  research,  it
‘reckons with time’ and regulates itself according to it. And here again what
remains  decisive  is  Dasein’s  way  of  ‘reckoning  with  its  time’—a  way  of
reckoning which precedes any use of measuring equipment by which time
can be determined. The reckoning is prior to such equipment, and is what
makes anything like the use of clocks possible at all.

In  its  factical  existence,  any  particular  Dasein  either  ‘has  the  time’  or
‘does not have it’. It either ‘takes time’ for something or ‘cannot allow any
time for it’. Why does Dasein ‘take time’, and why can it ‘lose’ it? Where
does it take time from? How is this time related to Dasein’s temporality?

H. 405

 

Factical  Dasein  takes  time  into  its  reckoning,  without  any  existential
understanding of temporality. Reckoning with time is an elemental kind of
behaviour which must be clarified before we turn to the question of what it
means  to  say  that  entities  are  ‘in  time’.  All  Dasein’s  behaviour  is  to  be
Interpreted in terms of its Being—that is, in terms of temporality. We must
show  how  Dasein  as temporality  temporalizes  a  kind  of  behaviour  which
relates  itself  to  time  by  taking  it  into  its  reckoning.  Thus  our  previous
characterization of temporality is not only quite incomplete in that we have
not  paid  attention  to  all  the  dimensions  of  this  phenomenon;  it  also  is
defective  in  principle  because  something  like  world-time,  in  the  rigorous
sense  of  the  existential-temporal  conception  of  the  world,  belongs  to
temporality  itself.  We  must  come  to  understand  how  this  is  possible  and
why it is necessary. Thus the ‘time’ which is familiar to us in the ordinary
way—the  time  ‘in  which’  entities  occur—will  be  illuminated,  and  so  will
the within-time-ness of these entities.

Everyday  Dasein,  the  Dasein  which  takes  time,  comes  across  time
proximally  in  what  it  encounters  within-the-world  as  ready-to-hand  and
present-at-hand.  The  time  which  it  has  thus  ‘experienced’  is  understood
within the horizon of that way of understanding Being which is the closest
for  Dasein;  that  is,  it  is  understood  as  something  which  is  itself  somehow
present-at-hand.  How  and  why  Dasein  comes  to  develop  the  ordinary
conception  of  time,  must  be  clarified  in  terms  of  its  state-of-Being  as
concerning  itself  with  time—a  state-of-Being  with  a  temporal  foundation.
The  ordinary  conception  of  time  owes  its  origin  to  a  way  in  which
primordial  time  has  been  levelled  off.  By  demonstrating  that  this  is  the
source of the ordinary conception, we shall justify our earlier Interpretation
of temporality as primordial time.

In  the  development  of  this  ordinary  conception,  there  is  a  remarkable
vacillation as to whether the character to be attributed to time is ‘subjective’
or  ‘Objective’.  Where  time  is  taken  as  being  in  itself,  it  gets  allotted  pre-
eminently  to  the  ‘soul’  notwithstanding.  And  where  it  has  the  kind  of
character which belongs to ‘consciousness’, it still functions ‘Objectively’.
In Hegel’s Interpretation of time both possibilities are brought to the point
where, in a certain manner, they cancel each other out. Hegel tries to define
the  connection  between  ‘time’  and  ‘spirit’  in  such  a  manner  as  to  make

intelligible  why  the  spirit,  as  history,  ‘falls  into  time’.  We  seem  to  be  in
accord  with  Hegel  in  the  results  of  the  Interpretation  we  have  given  for
Dasein’s temporality and for the way world-time belongs to it. But because
our  analysis  differs  in  principle  from  his  in  its  approach,  and  because  its
orientation  is  precisely  the  opposite  of  his  in  that  it  aims  at  fundamental
ontology,  a  short  presentation  of  Hegel’s  way  of  taking  the  relationship
between time and spirit may serve to make plain our existential-ontological
Interpretation  of  Dasein’s  temporality,  of  world-time,  and  of  the  source  of
the ordinary conception of time, and may settle this in a provisional manner.

H. 406

The question of whether and how time has any ‘Being’, and of why and
in what sense we designate it as ‘being’, cannot be answered until we have
shown to what extent temporality itself, in the totality of its temporalizing
makes it possible  for  us  somehow  to  have  an  understanding  of  Being  and
address  ourselves  to  entities.  Our  chapter  will  be  divided  as  follows:
Dasein’s temporality, and our concern with time (Section 79); the time with
which  we  concern  ourselves,  and  within-time-ness  (Section  80);  within-
time-ness and the genesis of the ordinary conception of time (Section 81); a
comparison of the existential-ontological connection of temporality, Dasein,
and world-time, with Hegel’s way of taking the relation between time and
spirit  (Section  82);  the  existential-temporal  analytic  of  Dasein  and  the
question  of  fundamental  ontology  as  to  the  meaning  of  Being  in  general
(Section 83).

79. Dasein’s Temporality, and our Concern with Time

Dasein exists as an entity for which, in its Being, that Being is itself an
issue. Essentially ahead of itself, it has projected itself upon its potentiality-
for-Being  before  going  on  to  any  mere  consideration  of  itself.  In  its
projection it reveals itself as something which has been thrown. It has been
thrownly abandoned to the ‘world’, and falls into it concernfully.(1) As care
—that is, as existing in the unity of the projection which has been fallingly
thrown—this entity has been disclosed as a “there”. As being with Others, it
maintains itself in  an average way  of interpreting—a way  which has been

 

 

Articulated in discourse and expressed in language. Being-in-the-world has
always expressed itself, and as Being alongside entities encountered within-
the-world,  it  constantly  expresses  itself  in  addressing  itself  to  the  very
object  of  its  concern  and  discussing  it.  The  concern  of  circumspective
common  sense  is  grounded  in  temporality—indeed  in  the  mode  of  a
making-present  which  retains  and  awaits.  Such  concern,  as  concernfully
reckoning  up,  planning,  preventing,  or  taking  precautions,  always  says
(whether audibly or not) that something is to happen ‘then’, that something
else is to be attended to ‘beforehand’, that what has failed or eluded us ‘on
that former occasion’ is something that we must ‘now’ make up for.(2)
 

1. ‘Geworfen der “Welt” überlassen, verfällt es besorgend an sie.’
2.  ‘…“dann”—soll  das  geschehen,  “zuvor”—jenes  seine  Erledigung  finden,  “jezt”—das
nachgeholt werden, was “damals” misslang und entging.’ Notice that the German ‘dann’, unlike its
English cognate ‘then’, is here thought of as having primarily a future reference.

H. 407

 

In the ‘then’, concern expresses itself as awaiting; in the ‘on that former
occasion’, as retaining; in the ‘now’, as making present. In the ‘then’—but
mostly unexpressed—lies the ‘now-not-yet’; that is to say, this is spoken in
a  making-present  which  is  either  awaitingly  retentive  or  awaitingly
forgetful. In the ‘on that former occasion’ lurks the ‘now-no-longer’. With
this, retaining expresses itself as a making-present which awaits. The ‘then’
and  the  ‘on  that  former  occasion’  are  understood  with  regard  to  a  ‘now’;
that is to say, making present has a peculiar importance. Of course it always
temporalizes itself in a unity with awaiting and retaining, even if these may
take the modified form of a forgetting which does not await anything; in the
mode of such forgetting, temporality ensnares itself in the Present, which, in
making  present,  says  pre-eminently  ‘Now!  Now!’  That  which  concern
awaits  as  what  is  closest  to  it,  gets  addressed  in  the  ‘forthwith’  [im
“sogleich”];  what  has  been  made  proximally  available  or  has  been  lost  is
addressed  in  the  ‘just-now’  [im  “soeben”].  The  horizon  for  the  retaining
which expresses itself in the ‘on that former occasion’ is the ‘earlier’; the
horizon for the ‘then’ is the ‘later on’ (‘that which is to come’); the horizon
for the ‘now’ is the ‘today’.

Every  ‘then’,  however,  is,  as  such,  a  ‘then,  when...’;  every  ‘on  that
former occasion’ is an ‘on that former occasion, when...’; every ‘now’ is a

‘now  that...’.(1)  The  ‘now’,  the  ‘then’,  and  the  ‘on  that  former  occasion’
thus  have  a  seemingly  obvious  relational  structure  which  we  call
“datability”  [Datierbarkeit].  Whether  this  dating  is  factically  done  with
respect  to  a  ‘date’  on  the  calendar,  must  still  be  completely  disregarded.
Even  without  ‘dates’  of  this  sort,  the  ‘now’,  the  ‘then’,  and  the  ‘on  that
former occasion’ have been dated more or less definitely. And even if the
dating  is  not  made  more  definite,  this  does  not  mean  that  the  structure  of
datability is missing or that it is just a matter of chance.
 

1. ‘Jedes “dann” aber ist als solthes ein “dann, wann...”, jedes “damals” ein “damals, als...”, jedes

“jetzt” ein “jetzt, da…”.’
 

Wherein  is  such  datability  grounded,  and  to  what  does  it  essentially
belong? Can  any  more  superfluous  question  indeed  be  raised?  It  is  ‘well
known’ that what we have in mind with the ‘now that...’ is a ‘point of time’.
The ‘now’ is time. Incontestably, the ‘now that...’, the ‘then, when…’, and
the  ‘on  that  former  occasion’  are  things  that  we  understand.  And  we  also
understand in a certain way that these are all connected with ‘time’. But that
with this sort of thing one has ‘time’ itself in mind, and how this is possible,
and  what  ‘time’  signifies—these  are  matters  of  which  we  have  no
conception  in  our  ‘natural’  understanding  of  the  ‘now’  and  so  forth.  Is  it
indeed obvious, then, that something like the ‘then’, the ‘now’, and the ‘on
that  former  occasion’,  is  something  we  ‘understand  without  further  ado’,
and  ‘quite  naturally’  bring  to  expression?  Where  do  we  get  this  ‘now
that...’? Have we found this sort of thing among entities within-the-world—
among those that are present-at-hand? Manifestly not. Then have we found
it  at  all?  Have  we  ever  set  ourselves  to  search  for  this  and  establish  its
character?  We  avail  ourselves  of  it  ‘at  any  time’  without  having  taken  it
over  explicitly,  and  we  constantly  make  use  of  it  even  though  we  do  not
always make utterances about it. Even in the most trivial, offhand kind of
everyday talk (‘It’s cold’, for instance) we also have in mind a ‘now that...’.
Why is it that when Dasein addresses itself to the objects of its concern, it
also  expresses  a  ‘now  that...’,  a  ‘then,  when...’,  or  an  ‘on  that  former
occasion, when...’, even though it does so mostly without uttering it? First,
because in addressing itself to something interpretatively, it expresses itself
too;  that  is  to  say,  it  expresses  its  Being  alongside  the  ready-to-hand—a
Being  which understands circumspectively and which uncovers  the  ready-
to-hand  and  lets  it  be  encountered.  And  secondly,  because  this  very

addressing  and  discussing—which  interprets  itself  also—is  based  upon  a
making-present and is possible only as such.(i)
 

i. Cf. Section 33, H. 154 ff.

H. 408

 

The making-present which awaits and retains, interprets itself.  And this
in turn is possible only because, as something which in itself is ecstatically
open,  it  has  in  each  case  been  disclosed  to  itself  already  and  can  be
Articulated  in  the  kind  of  interpretation  which  is  accompanied  by
understanding  and  discourse.  Because  temporality  is  ecstatico-horizonally
constitutive  for  the  clearedness  of  the  “there”,  temporality  is  always
primordially interpretable in the “there” and is accordingly familiar to us.
The making-present which interprets itself—in other words, that which has
been interpreted and is addressed in the ‘now’—is what we call ‘time’. This
simply makes known to us that temporality—which, as ecstatically open, is
recognizable—is  familiar,  proximally  and  for  the  most  part,  only  as
interpreted  in  this  concernful  manner.(1)  But  while  time  is  ‘immediately’
intelligible  and  recognizable,  this  does  not  preclude  the  possibility  that
primordial temporality as such may remain unknown and unconceived, and
that  this  is  also  the  case  with  the  source  of  the  time  which  has  been
expressed—a source which temporalizes itself in that temporality.
 

1.  ‘Das  sich  auslegende  Gegenwärtigen,  das  heisst  das  im  “jetzt”  angesprochene  Ausgelegte
nennen  wir  “Zeit”.  Darin  bekundet  sich  lediglich,  dass  die  Zeitlichkeit,  als  ekstatisch  offene
kenntlich,  zunächst  und  zumeist  nur  in  dieser  besorgenden  Ausgelegtheit  bekannt  ist.’  The  older
editions have ‘ausgesprochene’ (‘expressed’) rather than ‘angesprochene’ (‘addressed’); the comma
after ‘Zeitlichkeit’ is missing, and the particle ‘ja’ appears just before ‘zunächst’.

The  fact  that  the  structure  of  datability  belongs  essentially  to  what  has
been  interpreted  with  the  ‘now’,  the  ‘then’,  and  the  ‘on  that  former
occasion’,  becomes  the  most  elemental  proof  that  what  has  thus  been
interpreted  has  originated  in  the  temporality  which  interprets  itself.  When
we say ‘now’, we always understand a ‘now that so and so...’(1) though we
do not say all this. Why? Because the “now” interprets a making-present of
entities. In the ‘now that...’ lies the ecstatical character of the Present. The
datability  of  the  ‘now’,  the  ‘then’,  and  the  ‘on  that  former  occasion’,

reflects the ecstatical constitution of temporality,  and is  therefore essential
for the time itself that has been expressed. The structure of the datability of
the  ‘now’,  the  ‘then’,  and  the  ‘on  that  former  occasion’,  is  evidence  that
these,  stemming  from  temporality,  are  themselves  time.  The  interpretative
expressing of the ‘now’, the ‘then’, and the ‘on that former occasion’, is the
most  primordial  way  of  assigning  a  time.(2)  In  the  ecstatical  unity  of
temporality—which  gets  understood 
along  with  datability,  but
unthematically and without being recognizable as such—Dasein has already
been disclosed to itself as Being-in-the-world, and entities within-the-world
have  been  discovered  along  with  it;  because  of  this,  interpreted  time  has
already been given a dating in terms of those entities which are encountered
in the disclosedness of the “there”: “now that—the door slams”; “now that
—my book is missing”, and so forth.(3)

H. 409

 

The  horizons  which  belong  to  the  ‘now’,  the  ‘then’,  and  the  ‘on  that
former occasion’, all have their source in ecstatical temporality; by reason
of  this,  these  horizons  too  have  the  character  of  datability  as  ‘today,
when...’, ‘later on, when...’, and ‘earlier, when…’(4)
 

1.  ‘  “Jetzt”-sagend  verstehen  wir  immer  auch  schon,  ohne  es  mitzusagen,  ein  “—da  das  und

das”…’

2. ‘…dass diese vom Stamme der Zeitlichkeit, selbst Zeit sind. Das auslegende Aussprechen der
“jetzt”,  “dann”  und  “damals”  ist  die  ursprünglichste  Zeitangabe.’  The  earlier  editions  have  ‘sie’
instead  of  ‘diese’.  (While  we  have  generally  tried  to  reserve  the  verb  ‘assign’  for  verbs  such  as
‘verweisen’ and ‘zuweisen’, it is convenient to use it in this chapter to translate such expressions as
‘angeben’, ‘Angabe’, and ‘Zeitangabe’.)

3. ‘…jetzt, da—die Tür schlägt; jetzt, da—mir das Buch fehlt, und dergleichen.’ While the phrase
‘jetzt’ da...’ ordinarily means ‘now that...’, Heidegger here seems to be interpreting it with an illusion
to the ‘da’ which we have usually translated as ‘there’—the ‘da’ of ‘Dasein’.

4. ‘ “Heute, wo...”, “Späterhin, wann...” und “Früher, da…”.’

If  awaiting  understands  itself  in  the  ‘then’  and  interprets  itself,  and
thereby,  as  making  present,  understands  that  which  it  awaits,  and
understands this in terms of its ‘now’, then the ‘and-now-not-yet’ is already
implied  when  we  ‘assign’  a  ‘then’.  The  awaiting  which  makes  present
is  Articulated  by
understands 
interpretation:  it  ‘has  its  time’  as  the  “in-between”,  which  likewise  has  a
relationship  of  datability.  This  relationship  gets  expressed  in  the  ‘during-

‘until-then’.  This 

‘until-then’ 

the 

this’  or  ‘meanwhile’  [“während  dessen...”].  The  ‘during’  can  itself  be
Articulated  awaitingly  by  concern,  by  assigning  some  more  ‘thens’.  The
‘until-then’  gets  divided  up  by  a  number  of  ‘from-then-till-thens’,  which,
however,  have  been  ‘embraced’  beforehand  in  awaitingly  projecting  the
primary ‘then’. ‘Enduring’ gets Articulated in the understanding one has of
the  ‘during’  when  one  awaits  and  makes  present.(1)  This  lasting[Dauern],
in turn, is the time which is manifest in temporality’s interpretation of itself;
in our concern this time thus gets currently, but unthematically, understood
as a ‘span’ [“Spanne”]. The making-present which awaits and retains, lays
‘out’ a ‘during’ with a span, only because it has thereby disclosed itself as
the  way  in  which  its  historical  temporality  has  been  ecstatically  stretched
along,  even  though  it  does  not  know  itself  as  this.(2)  But  here  a  further
peculiarity  of  the  time  which  has  been  ‘assigned’  shows  itself.  Not  only
does the ‘during’ have a span; but every ‘now’, ‘then’, and ‘on that former
occasion’ has, with its datability-structure, its own spanned character, with
the  width  of  the  span  varying:  ‘now’—in  the  intermission,  while  one  is
eating, in the evening, in summer; ‘then’—at breakfast, when one is taking
a climb, and so forth.
 

1.  ‘Mit  dem  gewärtigend-gegenwärtigenden  Verstehen  des  “während”  wird  das  “Währen”
artikuliert.’ ‘Währen’ of course means ‘enduring’ in the sense of lasting or continuing, not in that of
‘suffering’ or ‘tolerating’.

2.  ‘Das  gewärtigend-behaltende  Gegenwärtigen  legt  nur  deshalb  ein  gespanntes  “während”
“aus”, weil es dabei sich als die ekstatische Erstrecktheit der geschichtlichen Zeitlichkeit, wenngleich
als solche unerkannt, erschlossen ist.’ Our translation of ‘gespanntes’ as ‘with a span’ preserves the
connection with ‘Spanne’ but misses the connotation of ‘tenseness’, which Heidegger clearly has in
mind elsewhere (e.g. H. 261 f., 374) and is surely suggesting here. The pun on ‘auslegen’ (‘interpret’)
and ‘legt... “aus” ’ (‘lays “out” ’) also disappears in translation.

H. 410

 

The  concern  which  awaits,  retains,  and  makes  present,  is  one  which
‘allows  itself’  so  much  time;  and  it  assigns  itself  this  time  concernfully,
even  without  determining  the  time  by  any  specific  reckoning,  and  before
any  such  reckoning  has  been  done.  Here  time  dates  itself  in  one’s  current
mode of allowing oneself time concernfully; and it does so in terms of those
very matters with which one concerns oneself environmentally, and which
have  been  disclosed  in  the  understanding  with  its  accompanying  state-of-
mind—in  terms  of  what  one  does  ‘all  day  long’.  The  more  Dasein  is

awaitingly  absorbed  in  the  object  of  its  concern  and  forgets  itself  in  not
awaiting itself, the more does even the time which it ‘allows’ itself remain
covered up by this way of ‘allowing’. When Dasein is ‘living along’ in an
everyday  concernful  manner,  it  just  never  understands  itself  as  running
along  in  a  Continuously  enduring  sequence  of  pure  ‘nows’.  By  reason  of
this  covering  up,  the  time  which  Dasein  allows  itself  has  gaps  in  it,  as  it
were. Often we do not bring a ‘day’ together again when we come back to
the time which we have ‘used’. But the time which has gaps in it does not
go  to  pieces  in  this  lack-of-togetherness,  which  is  rather  a  mode  of  that
temporality  which  has  already  been  disclosed  and  stretched  along
ecstatically.  The  manner  in  which  the  time  we  have  ‘allowed’  ‘runs  its
course’, and the way in which concern more or less explicitly assigns itself
that time, can be properly explained as phenomena only if, on the one hand,
we avoid the theoretical ‘representation’ of a Continuous stream of “nows”,
and if, on the other hand, the possible ways in which Dasein assigns itself
time and allows itself time are to be conceived of as determined primarily in
terms  of how  Dasein,  in  a  manner  corresponding  to  its  current  existence,
‘has’ its time.

In  an  earlier  passage  authentic  and  inauthentic  existing  have  been
characterized  with  regard  to  those  modes  of  the  temporalizing  of
temporality  upon  which  such  existing  is  founded.  According  to  that
characterization,  the  irresoluteness  of  inauthentic  existence  temporalizes
itself in the mode of a making-present which does not await but forgets. He
who is irresolute understands himself in terms of those very closest events
and  be-fallings  which  he  encounters  in  such  a  making-present  and  which
thrust  themselves  upon  him  in  varying  ways.  Busily  losing  himself  in  the
object  of  his  concern,  he  loses  his  time  in  it  too.  Hence  his  characteristic
way of talking—‘I have no time’. But just as he who exists inauthentically
is  constantly  losing  time  and  never  ‘has’  any,  the  temporality  of  authentic
existence  remains  distinctive  in  that  such  existence,  in  its  resoluteness,
never loses time and ‘always has time’. For the temporality of resoluteness
has, with relation to its Present, the character of a moment of vision.  When
such  a  moment  makes  the  Situation  authentically  present,  this  making-
present does not itself take the lead, but is held in that future which is in the
process  of  having-been.  One’s  existence  in  the  moment  of  vision
temporalizes  itself  as  something  that  has  been  stretched  along  in  a  way
which is fatefully whole in the sense of the authentic historical constancy of

the Self. This kind of temporal existence has its time for what the Situation
demands  of  it,  and  it  has  it  ‘constantly’.  But  resoluteness  discloses  the
“there” in this way only as a Situation. So if he who is resolute encounters
anything  that  has  been  disclosed,  he  can  never  do  so  in  such  a  way  as  to
lose his time on it irresolutely.

The  “there”  is  disclosed  in  a  way  which  is  grounded  in  Dasein’s  own
temporality as ecstatically stretched along, and with this disclosure a ‘time’
is allotted to Dasein; only because of this can Dasein, as factically thrown,
‘take’ its time and lose it.

H. 411

As  something  disclosed,  Dasein  exists  factically  in  the  way  of  Being
with  Others.  It  maintains  itself  in  an  intelligibility  which  is  public  and
average. When the ‘now that...’ and the ‘then when...’ have been interpreted
and  expressed  in  our  everyday  Being  with  one  another,  they  will  be
understood in principle, even though their dating is unequivocal only within
certain  limits.  In  the  ‘most  intimate’  Being-with-one-another  of  several
people, they can say ‘now’ and say it ‘together’, though each of them gives
a different date to the ‘now’ which he is saying: “now that this or that has
come  to  pass...”  The  ‘now’  which  anyone  expresses  is  always  said  in  the
publicness  of  Being-in-the-world  with  one  another.  Thus  the  time  which
any Dasein has currently interpreted and expressed has as such already been
given a public character  on  the  basis  of  that  Dasein’s  ecstatical  Being-in-
the-world. In so far, then, as everyday concern understands itself in terms of
the ‘world’ of its concern and takes its ‘time’, it does not know this ‘time’
as its own, but concernfully utilizes the time which ‘there is’ [“es gibt”]—
the time with which “they” reckon. Indeed the publicness of ‘time’ is all the
more  compelling,  the  more  explicitly  factical  Dasein  concerns  itself  with
time in specifically taking it into its reckoning.

80. The Time with which we Concern Ourselves, and Within-time-ness

So  far  we  have  only  had  to  understand  provisionally  how  Dasein,  as
grounded in  temporality, is,  in  its very existing, concerned with  times and
how, in such interpretative concern, time makes itself public for Being-in-

 

 

the-world.  But  the  sense  in  which  time  ‘is’  if  it  is  of  the  kind  which  is
public  and  has  been  expressed,  remains  completely  undefined,  if  indeed
such  time  can  be  considered  as  being  at  all.  Before  we  can  make  any
decision  as  to  whether  public  time  is  ‘merely  subjective’  or  ‘Objectively
actual’,  or  neither  of  these,  its  phenomenal  character  must  first  be
determined more precisely.

When  time  is  made  public,  this  does  not  happen  just  occasionally  and
subsequently.  On  the  contrary,  because  Dasein,  as  something  ecstatic-
temporal, is already disclosed, and because understanding and interpretation
both  belong  to  existence,  time  has  already  made  itself  public  in  concern.
One directs oneself according to it, so that it must somehow be the sort of
thing which Everyman can come across.

H. 412

 

Although  one  can  concern  oneself  with  time  in  the  manner  which  we
have characterized—namely, by dating in terms of environmental events—
this  always  happens  basically  within  the  horizon  of  that  kind  of  concern
with time which we know as astronomical and calendrical time-reckoning.
Such  reckoning  does  not  occur  by  accident,  but  has  its  existential-
ontological  necessity  in  the  basic  state  of  Dasein  as  care.  Because  it  is
essential to Dasein that it exists fallingly as something thrown, it interprets
its time concernfully by way of time-reckoning. In this,  the  ‘real’ making-
public  of  time  gets  temporalized,  so  that  we  must  say  that  Dasein’s
thrownness  is  the  reason  why  ‘there  is’  time  publicly.(1)  If  we  are  to
demonstrate that public time has its source in factical temporality, and if we
are to assure ourselves that this demonstration is as intelligible as possible,
the time which has been interpreted in the temporality of concern must first
be characterized, if only in order to make clear that the essence of concern
with time does not lie in the application of numerical procedures in dating.
Thus  in  time-reckoning,  what  is  decisive  from  an  existential-ontological
standpoint  is  not  to  be  seen  in  the  quantification  of  time  but  must  be
conceived  more  primordially  in  terms  of  the  temporality  of  the  Dasein
which reckons with time.
 

1. ‘In ihr zeitigt sich die “eigentliche” Veröffentlichung der Zeit, sodass gesagt werden muss: die
Geworfenheit des Daseins ist der Grund dafür, dass es öffentlich Zeit “gibt”.’ Heidegger’s quotation

marks around ‘gibt’ suggest an intentional pun which would permit the alternative translation: ‘...the
reason why Dasein “gives” time publicly.’

‘Public  time’  turns  out  to  be  the  kind  of  time  ‘in  which’  the  ready-to-
hand  and  the  present-at-hand  within-the-world  are  encountered.  This
requires that these entities which are not of the character of Dasein, shall be
called entities “within-time”. The Interpretation of within-time-ness gives us
a  more  primordial  insight  into  the  essence  of  ‘public  time’  and  likewise
makes it possible to define its ‘Being’.

The  Being  of  Dasein  is  care.  This  entity  exists  fallingly  as  something
that  has  been  thrown.  Abandoned  to  the  ‘world’  which  is  discovered  with
its  factical  “there”,  and  concernfully  submitted  to  it,  Dasein  awaits  its
potentiality-for-Being-in-the-world;  it  awaits  it  in  such  a  manner  that  it
‘reckons’ on and ‘reckons’ with whatever has an involvement for the sake of
this  potentiality-for-Being—an  involvement  which,  in  the  end,  is  a
distinctive  one.(1)  Everyday  circumspective  Being-in-the-world  needs  the
possibility of sight  (and this means that it needs brightness) if  it is  to  deal
concernfully  with  what  is  ready-to-hand  within  the  present-at-hand.  With
the factical disclosedness of Dasein’s world, Nature has been uncovered for
Dasein.  In  its  thrownness  Dasein  has  been  surrendered  to  the  changes  of
day and night. Day with its brightness gives it the possibility of sight; night
takes this away.

H. 413

 

Dasein awaits with circumspective concern the possibility of sight, and it
understands  itself  in  terms  of  its  daily  work;  in  thus  awaiting  and
understanding,  it  gives  its  time  with  the  ‘then,  when  it  dawns…’(2)  The
‘then’ with which Dasein concerns itself gets dated in terms of something
which  is  connected  with  getting  bright,  and  which  is  connected  with  it  in
the  closest  kind  of  environmental  involvement—namely,  the  rising  of  the
sun. “Then, when the sun rises, it is time for so and so.” Thus Dasein dates
the time which it must take, and dates it in terms of something it encounters
within the world and within the horizon of its abandonment to the world—
in terms of something encountered as having a distinctive involvement for
its  circumspective  potentiality-for-Being-in-the-world.  Concern  makes  use
of  the  ‘Being-ready-to-hand’  of  the  sun,  which  sheds  forth  light  and

warmth. The sun dates the time which is interpreted in concern. In terms of
this dating arises the ‘most natural’ measure of time—the day. And because
the temporality of that Dasein which must take its time is finite, its days are
already  numbered.  Concernful  awaiting  takes  precaution  to  define  the
‘thens’ with which it is to concern itself—that is, to divide up the day. And
the  ‘during-the-daytime’  makes  this  possible.  This  dividing-up,  in  turn,  is
done with regard to that by which time is dated—the journeying sun. Sunset
and  midday,  like  the  sunrise  itself,  are  distinctive  ‘places’  which  this
heavenly body occupies. Its regularly recurring passage is something which
Dasein,  as  thrown  into  the  world  and  giving  itself  time  temporalizingly,
takes into its reckoning. Dasein historizes from day to day by reason  of its
way  of  interpreting  time  by  dating  it—a  way  which  is  adumbrated  in  its
thrownness into the “there”. 

1.  ‘…dass  es  mit dem  und  auf  das  “rechnet”,  womit  es  umwillen  dieses  Seinkönnens  eine  am

 

Ende ausgezeichnete Bewandtnis hat.’

2. ‘…mit dem “dann, wann es tagt”…’

This  dating  of  things  in  terms  of  the  heavenly  body  which  sheds  forth
light and warmth, and in terms of its distinctive ‘places’ in the sky, is a way
of assigning time which can be done in our Being with one another ‘under
the  same  sky’,  and  which  can  be  done  for  ‘Everyman’  at  any  time  in  the
same way, so that within certain limits everyone is proximally agreed upon
it. That by which things are thus dated is available environmentally and yet
not restricted to the world of equipment with which one currently concerns
oneself. It is rather the case that in the world the environing Nature and the
public  environment  are  always  discovered  along  with  it.(ii)  This  public
dating, in which everyone assigns himself his time, is one which everyone
can ‘reckon’ on simultaneously; it uses a publicly available measure. This
dating  reckons  with  time  in  the  sense  of  a  measuring  of  time;  and  such
measuring requires something by which time is to be measured—namely, a
clock.  This  implies  that  along  with  the  temporality  of  Dasein  as  thrown,
abandoned to the ‘world’, and giving itself time, something like a ‘clock’ is
also  discovered—that  is,  something  ready-to-hand  which  in  its  regular
recurrence has become accessible in one’s making present awaitingly. The
Being  which  has  been  thrown  and  is  alongside  the  ready-to-hand  is
grounded  in  temporality.  Temporality  is  the  reason  for  the  clock.  As  the

condition for the possibility that a clock is factically necessary, temporality
is likewise the condition for its discoverability. For while the course of the
sun  is  encountered  along  with  the  discoveredness  of  entities  within-the-
world, it is only by making it present in awaitingly retaining, and by doing
so in a way which interprets itself, that dating in terms of what is ready-to-
hand environmentally in a public way is made possible and is also required.
 

ii. Cf. Section 15, H. 66 ff.

H. 414

 

Dasein  has  its  basis  in  temporality,  and  the  ‘natural’  clock  which  has
already been discovered along with Dasein’s factical thrownness furnishes
the  first  motivation  for  the  production  and  use  of  clocks  which  will  be
somewhat  more  handy;  it  also  makes  this  possible.  Indeed  it  does  this  in
such  a  manner  that  these  ‘artificial’  clocks  must  be  ‘adjusted’  to  that
‘natural’ one if the time which is primarily discoverable in the natural clock
is to be made accessible in its turn.

Before  describing  the  chief  features  in  the  development  of  time-
reckoning and the use of clocks in their existential-ontological meaning, we
must  first  characterize  more  completely  the  time  with  which  we  are
concerned  when  we  measure  it.  If  the  time  with  which  we  concern
ourselves is ‘really’ made public only when it gets measured, then if public
time is to be accessible in a way which has been phenomenally unveiled, we
must  have  access  to  it  by  following  up  the  way  in  which  that  which  has
been dated shows itself when dated in this ‘reckoning’ manner.

When the ‘then’ which interprets itself in concernful awaiting gets dated,
this  dating  includes  some  such  statement  as  “then—when  it  dawns—it  is
time  for  one’s  daily  work”.  The  time  which  is  interpreted  in  concern  is
already  understood  as  a  time  for  something.  The  current  ‘now  that  so  and
so...’ is as such either appropriate or inappropriate. Not  only  is  the  ‘now’
(and so too any mode of interpreted time) a ‘now that...’ which is essentially
datable;  but  as  such  it  has  essentially,  at  the  same  time,  the  structure  of
appropriateness or inappropriateness. Time which has been interpreted has
by  its  very  nature  the  character  of  ‘the  time  for  something’  or  ‘the  wrong
time  for  something’.(1)  When  concern  makes  present  by  awaiting  and
retaining, time is understood in relation to a “for-which”;(2) and this in turn

is ultimately tied up with a “for-the-sake-of-which” of Dasein’s potentiality-
for-Being.  With  this  “in-order-to”  relation,  the  time  which  has  been  made
public makes manifest that structure with which we have earlier(iii) become
acquainted  as  significance,  and  which  constitutes  the  worldhood  of  the
world.  As  ‘the  time  for  something’,  the  time  which  has  been  made  public
has essentially a world-character. Hence the time which makes itself public
in  the  temporalizing  of  temporality  is  what  we  designate  as  “world-time”.
And  we  designate  it  thus  not  because  it  is  present-at-hand  as  an  entity
within-the-world  (which  it  can  never  be),  but  because  it  belongs  to  the
world  [zur  Welt]  in  the  sense  which  we  have  Interpreted  existential-
ontologically.  In  the  following  pages  we  must  show  how  the  essential
relations  of  the  world-structure  (the  ‘in-order-to’,  for  example)  are
connected with public time (the ‘then, when...’, for example) by reason of
the  ecstatico-horizonal  constitution  of  temporality.  Only  now,  in  any  case,
can the time with which we concern ourselves be completely characterized
as  to  its  structure:  it  is  datable,  spanned,  and  public;  and  as  having  this
structure, it belongs to the world itself. Every ‘now’, for instance, which is
expressed  in  a  natural  everyday  manner,  has  this  kind  of  structure,  and  is
understood  as  such,  though  pre-conceptually  and  unthematically,  when
Dasein concernfully allows itself time.
 

iii. Cf. Section 18, H. 83 ff., and Section 69c, H. 364 ff.

1. ‘…den Charakter der “Zeit zu...” bzw. der “Unzeit für…’
2. ‘…ein Wozu...’ Here English idiom calls for the expression ‘for-which’ rather than ‘towards-
which’, though the latter expression has served us fairly well in similar context such as those cited in
Heidegger’s note iii below. (See also our note 1, H. 78 above.)

 

 

H. 415

The  disclosedness  of  the  natural  clock  belongs  to  the  Dasein  which
exists as thrown and falling; and in this disclosedness factical Dasein has at
the same time already given a distinctive public character to the time with
which  it  concerns  itself.  As  time-reckoning  is  perfected  and  the  use  of
clocks  becomes  more  refined,  this  making-public  gets  enhanced  and
strengthened.  We  shall  not  give  here  a  historiological  presentation  of  the
historical  evolution  of  time-reckoning  and  the  use  of  clocks,  with  all  its
possible  variations.  We  must  rather  ask  in  an  existential-ontological  way

what mode of the temporalizing of Dasein’s temporality becomes manifest
in the direction which  the  development  of  time-reckoning  and  clock-using
has  taken.  When  this  question  is  answered,  there  must  arise  a  more
primordial understanding of the fact that the measurement of time—and this
means also the explicit making-public of time as an object of concern—is
grounded  in  the  temporality  of  Dasein,  and  indeed  in  a  quite  definite
temporalizing of that temporality.

Comparison  shows  that  for  the  ‘advanced’  Dasein  the  day  and  the
presence of sunlight no longer have such a special function as they have for
the ‘primitive’ Dasein on which our analysis of ‘natural’ time-reckoning has
been  based;  for  the  ‘advanced’  Dasein  has  the  ‘advantage’  of  even  being
able to turn night into day. Similarly we no longer need to glance explicitly
and  immediately  at  the  sun  and  its  position  to  ascertain  the  time.  The
manufacture and use of measuring-equipment of one’s own permits one to
read  off  the  time  directly  by  a  clock  produced  especially  for  this  purpose.
The “what o’clock is it?” is the ‘what time is it?’ Because the clock—in the
sense of that which makes possible a public way of time-reckoning—must
be regulated by the ‘natural’ clock, even the use of clocks as equipment is
based  upon  Dasein’s  temporality,  which,  with  the  disclosedness  of  the
“there”,  first  makes  possible  a  dating  of  the  time  with  which  we  concern
ourselves; this is a fact, even if it is covered up when the time is read off.
Our  understanding  of  the  natural  clock  develops  with  the  advancing
discovery  of Nature, and  instructs  us  as  to  new  possibilities  for  a  kind  of
time-measurement  which  is  relatively  independent  of  the  day  and  of  any
explicit observation of the sky.

H. 416

 

But in a certain manner even ‘primitive’ Dasein makes itself independent
of reading off the time directly from the sky, when instead of ascertaining
the  sun’s  position  it  measures  the  shadow  cast  by  some  entity  available  at
any time. This can happen in the first instance in the simplest form of the
ancient  ‘peasant’s  clock’.  Everyman  is  constantly  accompanied  by  a
shadow;  and  in  the  shadow  the  sun  is  encountered  with  respect  to  its
changing  presence  at  different  places.  In  the  daytime,  shadows  have
different lengths which can be paced off ‘at any time’. Even if individuals
differ in the lengths of their bodies and feet, the relationship between them

remains constant within certain limits of accuracy. Thus, for example, when
one  is  concerned  with  making  an  appointment,  one  designates  the  time
publicly by saying, ‘When the shadow is so many feet long, then we shall
meet  yonder.’  Here  in  Being  with  one  another  within  the  rather  narrow
boundaries  of  an  environment  which  is  very  close  to  us,  it  is  tacitly
presupposed that the ‘locations’ at which the shadow gets paced off are at
the  same  latitude.  This  clock  is  one  which  Dasein  does  not  have  to  carry
around with it; in a certain manner Dasein itself is the clock.

The public sundial, in which the line of a shadow is counterposed to the
course  of  the  sun  and  moves  along  a  numbered  track,  needs  no  further
description. But why is it that at the position which the shadow occupies on
the  dial  we  always  find  something  like  time?  Neither  the  shadow  nor  the
divided  track  is  time  itself,  nor  is  the  spatial  relationship  between  them.
Where,  then,  is  the  time,  which  we  thus  read  off  directly  not  only  on  the
‘sundial’ but also on any pocket watch?

What  does  “reading  off  the  time”  signify?  ‘Looking  at  the  clock’  does
indeed  amount  to  more  than  observing  the  changes  in  some  item  of
equipment which is ready-to-hand, and following the positions of a pointer.
When  we  use  a  clock  in  ascertaining  what  o’clock  it  is,  we  say—whether
explicitly or not—“It is now such and such an hour and so many minutes;
now is the time for...” or “there is still time enough now until...”. Looking at
the clock is based on taking our time, and is guided by it. What has already
shown  itself  in  the  most  elementary  time-reckoning  here  becomes  plainer:
when we look at the clock and regulate ourselves according to the time, we
are essentially saying “now”. Here the “now” has in each case already been
understood  and  interpreted  in  its  full  structural  content  of  datability,
spannedness, publicness, and worldhood. This is so ‘obvious’ that we take
no note of it whatsoever; still less do we know anything about it explicitly.

H. 417

 

Saying  “now”,  however,  is  the  discursive  Articulation  of  a  making-
present which  temporalizes  itself  in  a  unity  with  a  retentive  awaiting.  The
dating  which  is  performed  when  one  uses  a  clock,  turns  out  to  be  a
distinctive way in which something present-at-hand is made present. Dating
does  not  simply  relate  to  something  present-at-hand;  this  kind  of  relating
has itself the character of measuring. Of course the number which we get by

measuring can be read off immediately. But this implies that when a stretch
is to be measured, we understand that our standard is, in a way, contained in
it;  that  is,  we  determine  the  frequency  of  its  presence  in  that  stretch.
Measuring is constituted temporally when a standard which has presence is
made present in a stretch which has presence. The idea of a standard implies
unchangingness; this means that for everyone at any time the standard, in its
stability, must be present-at-hand. When the time with which one concerns
oneself  is  dated  by  measuring,  one  interprets  it  by  looking  at  something
present-at-hand  and  making  it  present—something  which  would  not
become  accessible  as  a  standard  or  as  something  measured  except  by  our
making it present in this distinctive manner. Because the making-present of
something  having  presence  has  a  special  priority  in  dating  by  measuring,
the  measurement  in  which  one  reads  off  the  time  by  the  clock  also
expresses  itself  with  special  emphasis  in  the  “now”.  Thus  when  time  is
measured, it  is  made  public in  such  a  way  that  it  is  encountered  on  each
occasion  and  at  any  time  for  everyone  as  ‘now  and  now  and  now’.  This
time which is ‘universally’ accessible in clocks is something that we come
across as a present-at-hand multiplicity of “nows”, so to speak, though the
measuring of time is not directed thematically towards time as such.

The  temporality  of  factical  Being-in-the-world  is  what  primordially
makes the disclosure of space possible; and in each case spatial Dasein has
—out  of  a  “yonder”  which  has  been  discovered—allotted  itself  a  “here”
which is of the character of Dasein. Because of all this the time with which
Dasein concerns itself in its temporality is, as regards its datability, always
bound up with some location of that Dasein. Time itself does not get linked
to a location; but temporality is the condition for the possibility that dating
may  be  bound  up  with  the  spatially-local  in  such  a  way  that  this  may  be
binding  for  everyone  as  a  measure.  Time  does  not  first  get  coupled  with
space;  but  the  ‘space’  which  one  might  suppose  to  be  coupled  with  it,  is
encountered only on the basis of the temporality which concerns itself with
time. Inasmuch as both time-reckoning and the clock are founded upon the
temporality of  Dasein,  which  is  constitutive  for  this  entity  as  historical,  it
may  be  shown  to  what  extent,  ontologically,  the  use  of  clocks  is  itself
historical, and to what extent every clock as such ‘has a history’.(iv)
 

iv. Here we shall not go into the problem of the measurement of time as treated in the theory of
relativity.  If  the  ontological  foundations  of  such  measurement  are  to  be  clarified,  this  presupposes
that  world-time  and  within-time-ness  have  already  been  clarified  in  terms  of  Dasein’s  temporality,

and that light has also been cast on the existential-temporal Constitution of the discovery of Nature
and  the  temporal  meaning  of  measurement.  Any  axiomatic  for  the  physical  technique  of
measurement must rest upon such investigations, and can never, for its own part, tackle the problem
of time as such.

H. 418

 

The  time  which  is  made  public  by  our  measuring  it,  does  not  by  any
means turn into space because we date it in terms of spatial measurement-
relations.  Still  less  is  what  is  existential-ontologically  essential  in  the
measuring  of  time to  be  sought  in  the  fact  that  dated  ‘time’  is  determined
numerically in terms of spatial stretches  and  in  changes  in  the location of
some spatial Thing. What is ontologically decisive lies rather in the specific
kind  of  making-present  which  makes  measurement  possible.  Dating  in
terms of what is ‘spatially’ present-at-hand is so far from a spatializing of
time  that  this  supposed  spatialization  signifies  nothing  else  than  that  an
entity which is present-at-hand for everyone in every “now” is made present
in its own presence. Measuring time is essentially such that it is necessary
to say “now”; but in obtaining the measurement, we, as it were, forget what
has been measured as such, so that nothing is to be found except a number
and a stretch.

When Dasein concerns itself with time, then the less time it has to lose,
the more ‘precious’ does that time become, and the handier the clock must
be. Not only should we be able to assign the time ‘more precisely’, but the
very determining of the time should claim as little time as possible, though
it must still agree with the ways in which Others assign time.

Provisionally it was enough for us to point out the general ‘connection’
of the use of clocks with that temporality which takes its time. Just as the
concrete  analysis  of  astronomical  time-reckoning  in  its  full  development
belongs  to  the  existential-ontological  Interpretation  of  how  Nature  is
discovered, the foundations of historiological and calendrical ‘chronology’
can  be  laid  bare  only  within  the  orbit  of  the  tasks  of  analysing
historiological cognition existentially.(v)
 

v.  As  a  first  attempt  at  the  Interpretation  of  chronological  time  and  ‘historical  numeration’
[“Geschichtszahl”], cf. the author’s habilitation-lecture at Freiburg in the summer semester of 1915:
‘Der  Zeitbegriff  in  der  Geschichtswissenschaft’  (published  in  Zeitschrift  für  Philosophie  und
Philosophische Kritik, vol.  161,  1916,  pp.  173  ff.)  The  connections  between  historical  numeration,
world-time as calculated astronomically, and the temporality and historicality of Dasein need a more
extensive investigation.

The measurement of time gives it a marked public character, so that only
in this way does what we generally call ‘the time’ become well known. In
concern every Thing has ‘its time’ attributed to it. It ‘has’ it, and, like every
entity within-the-world, it can ‘have’ it only because after all it is ‘in time’.
That time ‘wherein’ entities within-the-world are encountered, we know as
“world-time”.  By  reason  of  the  ecstatico-horizonal  constitution  of  the
temporality  which  belongs  to  it,  this  has  the  same  transcendence  as  the
world itself. With the disclosedness of the world, world-time has been made
public, so that every temporally concernful Being alongside entities within-
the-world  understands  these  entities  circumspectively  as  encountered  ‘in
time’.

The  time  ‘in  which’  the  present-at-hand  is  in  motion  or  at  rest  is  not
‘Objective’, if  what  we  mean  by  that  is  the  Being-present-at-hand-in-itself
of  entities  encountered  within-the-world.  But  just  as  little  is  time
‘subjective’, if  by  this  we  understand  Being-present-at-hand  and  occurring
in  a  ‘subject’.  World-time  is  ‘more  Objective’  than  any  possible  Object
because,  with  the  disclosedness  of  the  world,  it  already  becomes
‘Objectified’  in  an  ecstatico-horizonal  manner  as  the  condition  for  the
possibility  of  entities  within-the-world.  Thus,  contrary  to  Kant’s  opinion,
one  comes  across  world-time just  as  immediately in  the  physical  as  in  the
psychical,  and  not  just  roundabout  by  way  of  the  psychical.  ‘Time’  first
shows  itself  in  the  sky—precisely  where  one  comes  across  it  when  one
regulates  oneself  naturally  according  to  it—so  that  ‘time’  even  becomes
identified with the sky.

H. 420

 

World-time,  moreover,  is  also  ‘more  subjective’  than  any  possible
subject; for it is what first makes possible the Being of the factically existing
Self—that Being which, as is now well understood, is the meaning of care.
‘Time’ is present-at-hand neither in the ‘subject’ nor in the ‘Object’, neither
‘inside’  nor  ‘outside’;  and  it  ‘is’  ‘earlier’  than  any  subjectivity  or
Objectivity, because it presents the condition for the very possibility of this
‘earlier’. Has it then any ‘Being’? And if not, is it then a mere phantom, or
is it something that has ‘more Being’ [“seiender”] than any possible entity?
Any investigation which goes further in the direction of questions such as
these, will come up against the same ‘boundary’ which has already set itself
up to our provisional discussion of the connection between truth and Being.
(vi) In whatever way these questions may be answered in what follows—or
in whatever way they may first of all get primordially formulated—we must
first  understand  that  temporality,  as  ecstatico-horizonal,  temporalizes
something  like  world-time,  which  constitutes  a  within-time-ness  of  the
ready-to-hand  and  the  present-at-hand.  But  in  that  case  such  entities  can
never be designated as ‘temporal’ in the strict sense. Like every entity with
a character other than that of Dasein, they are non-temporal, whether they
Really occur, arise and pass away, or subsist ‘ideally’.

If  world-time  thus  belongs  to  the  temporalizing  of  temporality,  then  it
can  neither  be  volatilized  ‘subjectivistically’  nor  ‘reified’  by  a  vicious
‘Objectification’. These two possibilities can be avoided with a clear insight
—not  just  by  wavering  insecurely  between  them—only  if  we  can
understand how everyday Dasein conceives of ‘time’ theoretically in terms
of an understanding of time in the way which is closest to it, and if we can
also understand to what extent this conception of time and the prevalence of
this  concept  obstruct  the  possibility  of  our  understanding  in  terms  of
primordial time what is meant by this conception—that is, the possibility of
understanding  it  as  temporality.  The  everyday  concern  which  gives  itself
time,  finds  ‘the  time’  in  those  entities  within-the-world  which  are
encountered  ‘in  time’.  So  if  we  are  to  cast  any  light  on  the  genesis  of  the
ordinary conception of time, we must take within-time-ness as our point of
departure.

H. 421

How  does  something  like  ‘time’  first  show  itself  for  everyday
circumspective  concern?  In  what  kind  of  concernful  equipment-using
dealings  does  it  become  explicitly  accessible?  If  it  has  been  made  public
with the disclosedness of the world, if it has always been already a matter of
concern  with 
the  discoveredness  of  entities  within-the-world—a
discoveredness  which  belongs  to  the  world’s  disclosedness—and  if  it  has
been  a  matter  of  such  concern  in  so  far  as  Dasein  calculates  time  in
reckoning  with itself, then  the  kind  of  behaviour  in  which  ‘one’  explicitly
regulates  oneself  according  to  time,  lies  in  the  use  of  clocks.  The
existential-temporal meaning of this turns out to be a making-present of the
travelling pointer. By following the positions of the pointer in a way which
makes present, one counts them. This making-present temporalizes itself in
the ecstatical unity of a retention which awaits. To retain the ‘on that former
occasion’  and  to  retain  it  by  making  it  present,  signifies  that  in  saying
“now” one is open for the horizon of the earlier—that is, of the “now-no-
longer”.  To  await  the  ‘then’  by  making  it  present,  means  that  in  saying
“now”  one  is  open  for  the  horizon  of  the  later—that  is,  of  the  “now-not-
yet”. Time is what shows itself in such a making-present. How then, are we
to  define  the  time  which  is  manifest  within  the  horizon  of  the
circumspective concernful clock-using in which one takes one’s time? This
time is that which is counted and which shows itself when one follows the
travelling  pointer,  counting  and  making  present  in  such  a  way  that  this
making-present temporalizes itself in an ecstatical unity with the retaining
and  awaiting  which  are  horizonally  open  according  to  the  “earlier”  and
“later”.  This,  however,  is  nothing  else  than  an  existential-ontological
interpretation of Aristotle’s definition of “time”: τοῦτο γάρ ἐστιν ὁ χρόνος,
ἀριθμὸς  κινήσεως  κατὰ  τὸ  πρότερον  καὶ  ὕστερον.  “For  this  is  time:  that
which is counted in the movement which we encounter within the horizon
of  the  earlier  and  later.”(vii)  This  definition  may  seem  strange  at  first
glance;  but  if  one  defines  the  existential-ontological  horizon  from  which
Aristotle  has  taken  it,  one  sees  that  it  is  as  ‘obvious’  as  it  at  first  seems
strange,  and  has  been  genuinely  derived.  The  source  of  the  time  which  is

thus manifest does not become a problem for Aristotle. His Interpretation of
time  moves  rather  in  the  direction  of  the  ‘natural’  way  of  understanding
Being.  Yet  because  this  very  understanding  and  the  Being  which  is  thus
understood  have  in  principle  been  made  a  problem  for  the  investigation
which  lies  before  us,  it  is  only  after  we  have  found  a  solution  for  the
question  of  Being  that  the  Aristotelian  analysis  of  time  can  be  Interpreted
thematically  in  such  a  way  that  it  may  indeed  gain  some  signification  in
principle, if the formulation of this question in ancient ontology, with all its
critical limitations, is to be appropriated in a positive manner.(viii)

Ever since Aristotle all discussions of the concept of time have clung in
principle to the Aristotelian definition; that is, in taking time as their theme,
they have taken it as it shows itself in circumspective concern. Time is what
is ‘counted’; that is to say, it is what is expressed and what we have in view,
even if unthematically, when the travelling pointer (or the shadow) is made
present. When one makes present that which is moved in its movement, one
says  ‘now  here,  now  here,  and  so  on’.  The  “nows”  are  what  get  counted.
And  these  show  themselves  ‘in  every  “now”  ’  as  “nows”  which  will
‘forthwith  be  no-longer-now’  and  “nows”  which  have  ‘just  been  not-yet-
now’.(1)  The  world-time  which  is  ‘sighted’  in  this  manner  in  the  use  of
clocks, we call the “now-time” [Jetzt-Zeit].

H. 422

When  the  concern  which  gives  itself  time  reckons  with  time,  the  more
‘naturally’ it does so, the less it dwells at the expressed time as such; on the
contrary, it is lost in the equipment with which it concerns itself, which in
each  case  has  a  time  of  its  own.  When  concern  determines  the  time  and
assigns  it,  the  more  ‘naturally’  it  does  so—that  is,  the  less  it  is  directed
towards  treating  time  as  such  thematically—all  the  more  does  the  Being
which is alongside the object of concern (the Being which falls as it makes
present)  say  unhesitatingly  (whether  or  not  anything  is  uttered)  “now”  or
“then” or “on that former occasion”. Thus for the ordinary understanding of

time,  time  shows  itself  as  a  sequence  of  “flows”  which  are  constantly
‘present-at-hand’, simultaneously passing away and coming along. Time is
understood as a succession, as a ‘flowing stream’ of “nows”, as the ‘course
of time’. What  is  implied  by  such  an  interpretation  of  the  world-time  with
which we concern ourselves?

We get the answer if we go back to the full essential structure of world-
time and compare this with that with which the ordinary understanding of
time is acquainted. We have exhibited datability as the first essential item in
the time with which we concern ourselves. This is grounded in the ecstatical
constitution  of  temporality.  The  ‘now’  is  essentially  a  “now  that...”.  The
datable “now”, which is understood in concern even if we cannot grasp it as
such,  is  in  each  case  one  which  is  either  appropriate  or  inappropriate.
Significance  belongs  to  the  structure  of  the  “now”.  We  have  accordingly
called  the  time  with  which  we  concern  ourselves  “world-time”.  In  the
ordinary interpretations of time as a sequence of “nows”, both datability and
significance are missing. These two structures are not permitted to ‘come to
the  fore’  when  time  is  characterized  as  a  pure  succession.  The  ordinary
interpretation  of  time  covers  them  up.  When  these  are  covered  up,  the
ecstatico-horizonal  constitution  of  temporality,  in  which  the  datability  and
the  significance  of  the  “now”  are  grounded,  gets  levelled  off. The  “nows”
get shorn of these relations, as it were; and, as thus shorn, they simply range
themselves along after one another so as to make up the succession.

H. 423

 

It is no accident that world-time thus gets levelled off and covered up by
the  way  time  is  ordinarily  understood.  But  just  because  the  everyday
interpretation of time maintains itself by looking solely in the direction of
concernful common sense, and understands only what ‘shows’ itself within
the common-sense horizon, these structures must escape it. That which gets
counted  when  one  measures  time  concernfully,  the  “now”,  gets  co-
understood in one’s concern with the present-at-hand and the ready-to-hand.
Now  so  far  as  this concern  with  time  comes  back  to  the  time  itself  which
has been co-understood, and in so far as it ‘considers’ that time, it sees the
“nows” (which indeed are also somehow ‘there’) within the horizon of that
understanding-of-Being  by  which  this  concern  is  itself  constantly  guided.
(ix)  Thus  the  “nows”  are  in  a  certain  manner  co-present-at-hand:  that  is,

entities  are  encountered,  and  so  too is  the  “now”.  Although  it  is  not  said
explicitly  that  the  “nows”  are  present-at-hand  in  the  same  way  as  Things,
they still get ‘seen’ ontologically within the horizon of the idea of presence-
at-hand. The “flows” pass away, and those which have passed away make
up  the  past.  The  “nows”  come  along,  and  those  which  are  coming  along
define  the  ‘future’.  The  ordinary  interpretation  of  world-time  as  now-time
never  avails  itself  of  the  horizon  by  which  such  things  as  world,
significance,  and  datability  can  be  made  accessible.  These  structures
necessarily remain covered up, all the more so because this covering-up is
reinforced  by  the  way  in  which  the  ordinary  interpretation  develops  its
characterization of time conceptually.

The sequence of “nows” is taken as something that is somehow present-
at-hand,  for  it  even  moves  ‘i  n  t  o   time’.(1)  We  say:  ‘In every  “now”  is
now; in every “now” it is already vanishing.’ In every “now”  the  “now”  is
now  and  therefore  it  constantly  has  presence  as  something  selfsame, even
though in every “now” another may be vanishing as it comes along.(2) Yet
as  this  thing  which  changes,  it  simultaneously  shows  its  own  constant
presence. Thus even Plato, who directed his glance in this manner at time as
a sequence of “flows” arising and passing away, had to call time “the image
of  eternity”:  εἰκὼ  δ΄  ἐπενόει  κινητόν  τινα  αἰῶνος  ποιῆσαι͵  καὶ  διακοσμῶν
ἅμα  οὐρανὸν  ποιεῖ  μένοντος  αἰῶνος  ἐν  ἑνὶ  κατ΄  ἀριθμὸν  ἰοῦσαν  αἰώνιον
εἰκόνα͵ τοῦτον ὃν δὴ χρόνον ὠνομάκαμεν.(x)

The  sequence  of  “nows”  is  uninterrupted  and  has  no  gaps.  No  matter
how  ‘far’  we  proceed  in  ‘dividing  up’  the  “now”,  it  is  always  now.  The
continuity(3)  of  time  is  seen  within  the  horizon  of  something  which  is
indissolubly present-at-hand.

x. Cf. Plato, Timaeus 37 d. [‘But he decided to make a kind of moving image of the eternal; and
while setting the heaven in order, he made an eternal image, moving according to number—an image
of that eternity which abides in oneness. It is to this image that we have given the name of “time”.’—

‘stetig’  and  ‘Stetigkeit’  as  ‘continuous’  and  ‘continuity’  respectively,  saving  ‘Continuous’  and
‘Continuity’ for ‘kontinuierlich’ and ‘Kontinuität’.

H. 424

 

When  one  takes  one’s  ontological  orientation  from  something  that  is
constantly  present-at-hand,  one  either  looks  for  the  problem  of  the
Continuity  of  time  or  one  leaves  this  impasse  alone.  In  either  case  the
specific  structure  of  world-time  must  remain  covered  up.  Together  with
datability  (which  has  an  ecstatical  foundation)  it  has  been  spanned.  The
spannedness  of  time  is  not  to  be  understood  in  terms  of  the  horizonal
stretching-along of the ecstatical unity of that temporality which has made
itself  public  in  one’s  concern  with  time.  The  fact  that  in  every  “now”,  no
matter how momentary, it is in each case already  n o w, must be conceived
in terms of something which is ‘earlier’ still and from which every  “now”
stems:  that  is  to  say,  it  must  be  conceived  in  terms  of  the  ecstatical
stretching-along  of  that  temporality  which  is  alien  to  any  Continuity  of
something present-at-hand but which, for its part, presents the condition for
the possibility of access to anything continuous(1) that is present-at-hand.

The  principal  thesis  of  the  ordinary  way  of  interpreting  time—namely,
that time is ‘infinite’—makes manifest most impressively the way in which
world-time  and  accordingly  temporality  in  general  have  been  levelled  off
and covered up by such an interpretation. It is held that time presents itself
proximally  as  an  uninterrupted  sequence  of  “flows”.  Every  “now”,
moreover,  is  already  either  a  “just-now”  or  a  “forthwith”.(2)  If  in
characterizing time we stick primarily and exclusively to such a sequence,
then  in  principle  neither  beginning  nor  end  can  be  found  in  it.  Every  last
“now”,  as  “now”,  is  always  already  a  “forthwith”  that  is  no  longer  [ein
Sofort-nicht-mehr]; thus it is time in the sense of the “no-longer-now”—in
the sense of the past. Every first “now” is a “just-now” that is not yet [ein
Soeben-noch-nicht];  thus  it  is  time  in  the  sense  of  the  “not-yet-now”—in
the sense of the ‘future’. Hence time is endless ‘on both sides’. This thesis
becomes possible only on the basis of an orientation towards a free-floating
“in-itself” of a course of “nows” which is present-at-hand—an orientation
in  which  the  full  phenomenon  of  the  “now”  has  been  covered  up  with
regard to its datability, its worldhood, its spannedness, and its character of
having a location of the same kind as Dasein’s, so that it has dwindled to an
unrecognizable  fragment.  If  one  directs  one’s  glance  towards  Being-

present-at-hand  and  not-Being-present-at-hand,  and  thus  ‘thinks’  the
sequence of “nows” through ‘to the end’, then an end can never be found.
In this way of thinking time through to the end, one must always think more
time; from this one infers that time is infinite.

But  wherein  are  grounded  this  levelling-off  of  world-time  and  this
covering-up of temporality? In the Being of Dasein itself, which we have,
in a preparatory manner, Interpreted as care.(xi) Thrown and falling, Dasein
is proximally and for the most part lost in that with which it concerns itself.
In  this  lostness,  however,  Dasein’s  fleeing  in  the  face  of  that  authentic
existence  which  has  been  characterized  as  “anticipatory  resoluteness”,  has
made itself known; and this is a fleeing which covers up. In this concernful
fleeing lies a fleeing in the face of death—that is, a looking-away from the
end  of  Being-in-the-world.(xii)  This  looking-away  from  it,  is  in  itself  a
mode  of  that  Being-towards-the-end  which  is  ecstatically  futural.  The
inauthentic  temporality  of  everyday  Dasein  as  it  falls,  must,  as  such  a
looking-away  from  finitude,  fail  to  recognize  authentic  futurity  and
therewith temporality in general. And if indeed the way in which Dasein is
ordinarily understood is guided by the “they”, only so can the self-forgetful
‘representation’ of the ‘infinity’ of public time be strengthened. The “they”
never dies because it cannot die; for death is in each case mine, and only in
anticipatory  resoluteness  does  it  get  authentically  understood  in  an
existentiell  manner.  Nevertheless,  the  “they”,  which  never  dies  and  which
misunderstands Being-towards-the-end, gives a characteristic interpretation
to fleeing in the face of death. To the very end ‘it always has more time’.
Here a way of “having time” in the sense that one can lose it makes itself
known.  ‘Right  now,  this!  then  that!  And  that  is  barely  over,  when…’(1)
Here  it  is  not  as  if  the  finitude  of  time  were  getting  understood;  quite  the
contrary, for concern sets out to snatch as much as possible from the time
which still keeps coming and ‘goes on’. Publicly, time is something which
everyone takes and can take. In the everyday way in which we are with one
levelled-off  sequence  of  “nows”  remains  completely
another, 

the 

unrecognizable  as  regards  its  origin  in  the  temporality  of  the  individual
Dasein. How is ‘time’ in its course to be touched even the least bit when a
man who has been present-at-hand ‘in time’ no longer exists?(2) Time goes
on,  just  as  indeed  it  already  ‘was’  when  a  man  ‘came  into  life’.  The  only
time  one  knows  is  the  public  time  which  has  been  levelled  off  and  which
belongs to everyone—and that means, to nobody.

But just as he who flees in the face of death is pursued by it even as he
evades it, and just as in turning away from it he must see it none the less,
even  the  innocuous  infinite  sequence  of  “nows”  which  simply  runs  its
course, imposes itself ‘on’ Dasein in a remarkably enigmatical way.(3)
 

xi. Cf. Section 41, H. 191 ff.
xii. Cf. Section 51, H. 252 ff.

 

1. ‘…“jetzt erst noch das, dann das, und nur noch das und dann...” ’
2.  ‘Die  nivellierte  Jetztfolge  bleibt  völlig  unkenntlich  bezüglich  ihrer  Herkunft  aus  der
Zeitlichkeit  des  einzelnen  Daseins  im  alltäglichen  Miteinander.  Wie  soll  das  auch  “die  Zeit”  im
mindesten in ihrem Gang berühren, wenn ein “in der Zeit” vorhandener 
Mensch nicht mehr existiert?’

3.  ‘…so  legt  sich  auch  die  lediglich  ablaufende,  harmlose,  unendliche  Folge  der  Jetzt  doch  in

einer merkwürdigen Rätselhaftigkeit “über” das Dasein.’

Why do we say that time passes away, when we do not say with just as
much  emphasis  that  it  arises?  Yet  with  regard  to  the  pure  sequence  of
“nows” we have as much right to say one as the other. When Dasein talks of
time’s passing away, it understands, in the end, more of time than it wants
to  admit;  that  is  to  say,  the  temporality  in  which  world-time  temporalizes
itself has not  been  completely  closed  off, no  matter  how  much  it  may  get
covered  up.  Our  talk  about  time’s  passing-away  gives  expression  to  this
‘experience’: time does not let itself be halted. This ‘experience’ in turn is
possible only because the halting of time is something that we want. Herein
lies an inauthentic awaiting of ‘moments’—an awaiting in which these are
already forgotten as they glide by. The awaiting of inauthentic  existence—
the  awaiting  which  forgets  as  it  makes  present—is  the  condition  for  the
possibility  of  the  ordinary  experience  of  time’s  passing-away.  Because
Dasein  is  futural  in  the  “ahead-of-itself”,  it  must,  in  awaiting,  understand
the  sequence  of  “nows”  as  one  which  glides  by as  it  passes  away.  Dasein
knows fugitive time in terms of its ‘fugitive’ knowledge about its death. In
the kind of talk which emphasizes time’s passing away, the finite futurity of

Dasein’s temporality  is  publicly reflected. And because  even in  talk about
time’s  passing  away,  death  can  remain  covered  up,  time  shows  itself  as  a
passing-away ‘in itself’.

H. 426

 

But  even  in  this  pure  sequence  of  “nows”  which  passes  away  in  itself,
primordial  time  still  manifests  itself  throughout  all  this  levelling  off  and
covering up. In the ordinary interpretation, the stream of time is defined as
an irreversible succession. Why cannot time be reversed? Especially if one
looks  exclusively  at  the  stream  of  “nows”,  it  is  incomprehensible  in  itself
why  this  sequence  should  not  present  itself  in  the  reverse  direction.  The
impossibility of this reversal has its basis in the way public time originates
in temporality, the temporalizing of which is primarily futural and ‘goes’ to
its end ecstatically in such a way that it ‘is’ already towards its end.

The  ordinary  way  of  characterizing  time  as  an  endless,  irreversible
sequence  of  “nows”  which  passes  away,  arises  from  the  temporality  of
falling  Dasein.  The  ordinary  representation  of  time  has  its  natural
justification.  It  belongs  to  Dasein’s  average  kind  of  Being,  and  to  that
understanding of Being which proximally prevails. Thus proximally and for
the  most  part,  even  history  gets  understood  publicly  as  happening  within-
time.(1)  This  interpretation  of  time  loses  its  exclusive  and  pre-eminent
justification only if it claims to convey the ‘true’ conception of time and to
be  able  to  prescribe  the  sole  possible  horizon  within  which  time  is  to  be
Interpreted.  On  the  contrary,  it  has  emerged  that  why  and  how  world-time
belongs  to  Dasein’s  temporality  is  intelligible  only  in  terms  of  that
temporality  and  its  temporalizing.  From  temporality  the  full  structure  of
world-time  has  been  drawn;  and  only  the  Interpretation  of  this  structure
gives us the clue for ‘seeing’ at all that in the ordinary conception of time
something has been covered up, and for estimating how much the ecstatico-
horizonal constitution of temporality has been levelled off. This orientation
by Dasein’s temporality indeed makes it possible to exhibit the origin and
the factical necessity of this levelling off and covering up, and at the same
time to test the arguments for the ordinary theses about time.

On  the  other  hand,  within  the  horizon  of  the  way  time  is  ordinarily
understood, temporality is inaccessible in the reverse direction.(1) Not only
must  the  now-time  be  oriented  primarily  by  temporality  in  the  order  of
possible  interpretation,  but  it  temporalizes  itself  only  in  the  inauthentic
temporality  of  Dasein;  so  if  one  has  regard  for  the  way  the  now-time  is
derived from temporality, one is justified in considering temporality as the
time which is primordial.
 

1.  ‘Dagegen  bleibt  umgekehrt  die  Zeitlichkeit  im  Horizont  des  vulgären  Zeitverständnisses

unzugänglich.’

H. 427

 

Ecstatico-horizonal temporality temporalizes itself primarily in terms of
the  future.  In  the  way  time  is  ordinarily  understood,  however,  the  basic
phenomenon  of  time  is  seen  in  the  “now”, and  indeed  in  that  pure  “now”
which  has  been  shorn  in  its  full  structure—that  which  they  call  the
‘Present’. One can gather from this that there is in principle no prospect that
in  terms  of  this  kind  of  “now”  one  can  clarify  the  ecstatico-horizonal
phenomenon of the moment of vision which belongs to temporality, or even
that  one  can  derive  it  thus.  Correspondingly,  the  future  as  ecstatically
understood—the datable and significant ‘then’—does not coincide with the
ordinary conception of the ‘future’ in the sense of a pure “now” which has
not yet come along but is only coming along. And the concept of the past in
the  sense  of  the  pure  “now”  which  has  passed  away,  is  just  as  far  from
coinciding  with  the  ecstatical  “having-been”—the  datable  and  significant
‘on a former occasion’. The “now” is not pregnant with the “not-yet-now”,
but  the  Present  arises  from  the  future  in  the  primordial  ecstatical  unity  of
the temporalizing of temporality.(xiii)

Although,  proximally  and  for  the  most  part,  the  ordinary  experience  of
time  is  one  that  knows  only  ‘world-time’,  it  always  gives  it  a  distinctive
relationship  to  ‘soul’  and  ‘spirit’,  even  if  this  is  still  a  far  cry  from  a
the
inquiry  oriented  explicitly  and  primarily 
philosophical 
‘subject’.  As  evidence  for  this,  two  characteristic  passages  will  suffice.
Aristotle says: εἰ  δὲ  μηδὲν  ἄλλο  πέφυκεν  ἀριθμεῖν  ἢ  ψυχὴ  καὶ  ψυχῆς  νοῦς,
ἀδύνατον εἶναι χρόνον ψυχῆς μὴ οὔσης…(xiv) And Saint Augustine writes:
“inde mihi visum est, nihil esse aliud tempus quam distentionem; sed cuius

towards 

rei  nescio;  et  mirum  si  non  ipsius  animi.”(xv)  Thus  in  principle  even  the
Interpretation  of Dasein as temporality  does not  lie beyond the  horizon of
the ordinary conception of time. And Hegel has made an explicit attempt to
set forth the way in which time as ordinarily understood is connected with
spirit. In Kant, on the other hand, while time is indeed ‘subjective’, it stands
‘beside’ the ‘I think’ and is not bound up with it.(xvi) The  grounds which
Hegel has explicitly provided for the connection between time and spirit are
well suited to elucidate indirectly the foregoing Interpretation of Dasein as
temporality and our exhibition of temporality as the source of world-time.
 

xiii. The fact that the traditional conception of “eternity” as signifying the “standing “now” (nunc
stans), has been drawn from the ordinary way of understanding time and has been defined with an
orientation towards the idea of ‘constant’ presence-at-hand, does not need to be discussed in detail. If
God’s  eternity  can  be  ‘construed’  philosophically,  then  it  may  be  understood  only  as  a  more
primordial  temporality  which  is  ‘infinite’.  Whether  the  way  afforded  by  the  via  negationis  et
eminentiae is a possible one, remains to be seen.

82.  A  Comparison  of  the  Existential-ontological  Connection  of
Temporality,  Dasein,  and  World-time,  with  Hegel’s  Way  of  Taking  the
Relation between Time and Spirit
 

H. 428

 

History,  which  is  essentially  the  history  of  spirit,  runs  its  course  ‘in
time’.  Thus  ‘the  development  of  history  falls  into  time’.(xvii)(1) Hegel  is
not satisfied, however, with averring that the within-time-ness of spirit is a
Fact, but seeks to understand how it is possible for  spirit to  fall  into time,
which is ‘the non-sensuous sensuous’.(xviii) Time must be able, as it were,
to  take  in  spirit.  And  spirit  in  turn  must  be  akin  to  time  and  its  essence.
Accordingly two points come up for discussion: (1) how does Hegel define
the essence of time? (2) what belongs to the essence of spirit which makes

it possible for it to ‘fall into time’? Our answer to these questions will serve
merely to elucidate our Interpretation of Dasein as temporality, and to do so
by way of a comparison. We shall make no claim to give even a relatively
full treatment of the allied problems in Hegel, especially since ‘criticizing’
him will not help us. Because Hegel’s conception of time presents the most
radical  way  in  which  the  ordinary  understanding  of  time  has  been  given
form  conceptually,  and  one  which  has  received  too  little  attention,  a
comparison of this conception with the idea of temporality which we have
expounded is one that especially suggests itself.

attention  to  it  explicitly.  (In  this  quotation,  as  in  several  others,  Heidegger  has  taken  a  few  minor
liberties with Hegel’s text, which are too trivial for any special comment.)

(a) Hegel’s Conception of Time

 

 

H. 429

When a philosophical Interpretation of time is carried out, it gets a ‘locus
in a system’; this locus may be considered as criterial for the basic way of
treating time by which such an Interpretation is guided. In the ‘physics’ of
Aristotle—that  is,  in  the  context  of  an  ontology  of  Nature—the  ordinary
way  of  understanding  time  has  received  its  first  thematically  detailed
interpretation.  ‘Time’,  ‘location’,  and  ‘movement’  stand
traditional 
together.  True  to  tradition,  Hegel’s  analysis  of  time  has  its  locus  in  the
second  part  of  his  Encyclopedia  of  the  Philosophical  Sciences,  which  is
entitled ‘Philosophy of Nature’. The first portion of this treats of mechanics,
and of this the first division is devoted to the discussion of ‘space and time’.
He calls these ‘the abstract “outside-of-one-another” ’.(xix)

Though Hegel puts space and time together, this does not happen simply
because he has arranged them superficially one after the other: space, ‘and
time also’. ‘Philosophy combats such an “also”.’ The transition from space
to time does not signify that these are treated in adjoining paragraphs; rather
‘it is space itself that makes the transition’.(1) Space ‘is’ time; that is, time
is the ‘truth’ of space.(xx) If space is thought dialectically in  that which  it
is, then according to Hegel this Being of space unveils itself as time. How
must space be thought?

Space  is  ‘the  unmediated  indifference  of  Nature’s  Being-outside-of-
itself’.(xxi)  This  is  a  way  of  saying  that  space  is  the  abstract  multiplicity
[Vielheit]  of  the  points  which  are  differentiable  in  it.(2)  Space  is  not
interrupted by these; but neither does it arise from them by way of joining
them together. Though it is differentiated by differentiable points which are
space themselves, space remains, for its part, without any differences. The
differences  themselves  are  of  the  same  character  as  that  which  they
differentiate. Nevertheless, the point, in so far as it differentiates anything in
space,  is  the  negation  of  space,  though  in  such  a  manner  that,  as  this
negation, it itself remains in space; a point is space after all. The point does
not lift itself out of space as if it were something of another character. Space
is 
the  multiplicity  of  points
[Punktmannigfaltigkeit], and it is without any differences. But it is not as if
space  were  a  point;  space  is  rather,  as  Hegel  says,  ‘punctuality’
[“Punktualität”].(xxii)  This  is  the  basis  for  the  sentence  in  which  Hegel
thinks of space in its truth—that is, as time: ‘Negativity, which relates itself
as point to space, and which develops in space its determinations as line and
surface, is, however, just as much for itself in the sphere of Being-outside-
of-itself and so are its determinations therein, though while it is positing as
in the sphere of Being-outside-of-itself, it appears indifferent as regards the
things  that  are  tranquilly  side  by  side.  As  thus  posited  for  itself;  it  is
time.’(xxiii)

bezieht  und  in  ihm  ihre  Bestimmungen  als  Linie  und  Fläche  entwickelt,  ist  aber  in  der  Sphäre  des
Aussersichseins ebensowohl für sich und ihre Bestimmungen darin, aber zugleich als in der Sphäre

für sich gesetzt, ist sie die Zeit.’ This version differs somewhat from that given in the earlier editions

or  ‘discriminate’,  and  ‘Unterschied’  as  ‘distinction’  or  ‘difference’,  leaving  ‘differentiate’  and
‘differentiation’ for such words as ‘differenzieren’ and ‘Differenz’, etc. In this discussion of Hegel,
however,  it  will  be  convenient  to  translate  ‘unterscheiden’  as  ‘differentiate’,  ‘Unterschied’  as
‘difference’, ‘unterscheidbar’ as ‘differentiable’, ‘unterschiedslos’ as ‘without differences’. (We shall
continue to translate ‘gleichgültig as ‘indifferent’.)

H. 430

 

If  space  gets  represented—that  is,  if  it  gets  intuited  immediately  in  the
indifferent subsistence of its differences—then the negations are, as it were,
simply given. But by such a representation, space does not get grasped in its
Being. Only in thinking is it possible for this to be done—in thinking as the
synthesis  which  has  gone  through  thesis  and  antithesis  and  transmuted
them.  Only  if  the  negations  do  not  simply  remain  subsisting  in  their
indifference  but  get  transmuted—that  is,  only  if  they  themselves  get
negated—does  space  get  thought  and  thus  grasped  in  its  Being.  In  the
negation  of  the  negation  (that  is,  of  punctuality)  the  point  posits  itself  for
itself and thus emerges from the indifference of subsisting. As that which is
posited for itself, it differentiates itself from this one and from that one: it is
no  longer  this  and  not  yet  that.  In  positing  itself  for  itself,  it  posits  the
succession in which it stands—the sphere of Being-outside-of-itself, which
is  by  now  the  sphere  of  the  negated  negation.  When  punctuality  as
indifference gets transmuted, this signifies that it no longer remains lying in
the ‘paralysed tranquillity of space’. The point ‘gives itself airs’ before all
the  other  points.(1)  According  to  Hegel,  this  negation  of  the  negation  as
punctuality is time. If this discussion has any demonstrable meaning, it can
mean nothing else than that the positing-of-itself-for-itself of every point is
a “now-here”, “now-here”, and so on. Every point ‘is’ posited for itself as a
now-point. ‘In time the point thus has actuality.’ That  through  which  each
point,  as  this  one  here,  can  posit  itself  for  itself,  is  in  each  case  a  “now”.
The “now”  is  the  condition  for  the possibility  of the  point’s positing  itself

for  itself.  This  possibility-condition  makes  up  the  Being of  the  point,  and
Being  is  the  same  as  having  been  thought.  Thus  in  each  case  the  pure
thinking  of  punctuality—that  is,  of  space—‘thinks’  the  “now”  and  the
Being-outside-of-itself of the “now”; because of this, space ‘is’ time.  How
is time itself defined?
 

1. ‘Der Punkt “spreizt sich auf” gegenüber allen anderen Punkten.’ The verb ‘spreizen’ means ‘to
spread  apart’;  but  when  used  reflexively,  as  here,  it  takes  on  the  more  specific  connotation  of
swaggering, giving oneself airs.

H. 431

 

‘Time,  as  the  negative  unity  of  Being-outside-of-itself,  is  likewise
something simply abstract, ideal. It is that Being which, in that it is, is not,
and which, in that it is not, is: it is intuited becoming. This means that those
differences  which,  to  be  sure,  are  simply  momentary,  transmuting
themselves  immediately,  are  defined  as  external,  yet  as  external  to
themselves.(xxiv)  For  this  interpretation,  time  reveals  itself  as  ‘intuited
becoming’.  According  to  Hegel  this  signifies  a  transition  from  Being  to
nothing  or  from  nothing  to  Being.(xxv)  Becoming  is  both  arising  and
passing  away.  Either  Being  ‘makes  the  transition’,  or  not-Being  does  so.
What does this mean with regard to time? The Being of time is the “now”.
Every  “now”,  however,  either  ‘now’  is-no-longer,  or  now  is-not-yet;  so  it
can be taken also as not-Being.(1) Time is ‘intuited’ becoming—that  is  to
say, it is the transition which does not get thought but which simply tenders
itself  in  the  sequence  of  “nows”.  If  the  essence  of  time  is  defined  as
‘intuited  becoming’,  then  it  becomes  manifest  that  time  is  primarily
understood in terms of the “now”, and indeed in the very manner in which
one comes across such a “now” in pure intuition.

1. ‘Das Sein der Zeit ist das Jetzt; sofern aber jedes Jetzt “jetzt” auch schon nicht-mehr-bzw. je

jetzt zuvor noch-nicht-ist, kann es auch als Nichtsein gefasst werden.’

No  detailed  discussion  is  needed  to  make  plain  that  in  Hegel’s
Interpretation of time he is moving wholly in the direction of the way time

is ordinarily understood. When he characterizes time in terms of the “now”,
this presupposes that in its full structure the “now” remains levelled off and
covered up, so that it can be intuited as something present-at-hand, though
present-at-hand only ‘ideally’.

That  Hegel  Interprets  time  in  terms  of  this  primary  orientation  by  the
“now” which has been levelled off, is evidenced by the following sentences:
‘The  “now”  is  monstrously  privileged:  it  ‘is’  nothing  but  the  individual
“now”; but in giving itself airs, this thing which is so exclusive has already
been  dissolved,  diffused,  and  pulverized,  even  while  I  am  expressing
it.’(xxvi)  ‘In  Nature,  moreover,  where  time  is    n  o  w,  no  “stable”
[“bestehend”] difference between these dimensions’ (past and future) ‘ever
comes about’.(xxvii) ‘Thus in a positive sense one can say of time that only
the Present is; the “before” and “after” are not; but the concrete Present is
the result of the past and is pregnant with the future. Thus the true Present is
eternity.’(xxviii)

appears in a considerably less accurate form in the earlier editions of Heidegger’s work.—Tr.]

H. 432

 

If Hegel calls time ‘intuited becoming’, then neither arising nor passing
away  has  any  priority  in  time.  Nevertheless,  on  occasion  he  characterizes
time as the ‘abstraction of consuming’ [“Abstraktion des Verzehrens”]—the
most  radical  formula  for  the  way  in  which  time  is  ordinarily  experienced
and interpreted.(xxix) On the other hand, when Hegel really defines “time”,
he is consistent enough to grant no such priority to consuming and passing
away as that which the everyday way of experiencing time rightly adheres
to;  for  Hegel  can  no  more  provide  dialectical  grounds  for  such  a  priority
than he can for the ‘circumstance’ (which he has introduced as self-evident)
that the “now” turns up precisely in the way the point posits itself for itself.
So even when he characterizes time as “becoming”, Hegel understands this
“becoming” 
the
representation of the ‘stream’ of time. Thus the most appropriate expression
which the Hegelian treatment of time receives, lies in his defining it as “the

in  an  ‘abstract’  sense,  which  goes  well  beyond 

negation  of  a  negation”  (that  is,  of  punctuality).  Here  the  sequence  of
“nows” has been formalized in the most extreme sense and levelled off in
such  a  way  that  one  can  hardly  go  any  farther.(xxx)  Only  from  the
standpoint of this formal-dialectical conception of time can Hegel produce
any connection between time and spirit.
 

xxix. Ibid., Section 258, addendum. [The passage from Hegel reads as follows: ‘Time is not, as it
were, a receptacle in which everything has been put in a stream, and from which it gets swept away
and swept under. Time is only this abstraction of such consuming.’—Tr.]

xxx. The priority which Hegel has given to the “now” which has been levelled off; makes it plain
that in defining the concept of time he is under the sway of the manner in which time is ordinarily
understood; and this means that he is likewise under the sway of the traditional conception of it. It
can  even  be  shown  that  his  conception  of  time  has  been  drawn  directly  from  the  ‘physics’  of
Aristotle.

In  the  Jena  Logic  (Cf.  G.  Lasson’s  1923  edition),  which  was  projected  at  the  time  of  Hegel’s
habilitation, the analysis of time which we find in his Encyclopedia has already been developed in all
its essential parts. Even the roughest examination reveals that the section on time (pp. 202 ff.) is a
paraphrase of Aristotle’s essay on time. In the Jena Logic Hegel has already developed his view of
time  within  the  framework  of  his  philosophy  of  Nature  (p.  186),  the  first  part  of  which  is  entitled
‘System of the Sun’ (p. 195). Hegel discusses the concept of time in conjunction with defining the
concepts  of  aether  and  motion.  Here  too  his  analysis  of  space  comes  later.  Though  the  dialectic
already emerges, it does not have as yet the rigid schematic form which it will have afterward, but
still makes it possible to understand the phenomena in a fairly relaxed manner. On the way from Kant
to  Hegel’s  developed  system,  the  impact  of  the  Aristotelian  ontology  and  logic  has  again  been
decisive. The Fact of this impact has long been well known. But the kind of effect it has had, the path
it has taken, even its limitations, have hitherto been as obscure as the Fact itself has been familiar. A
concrete  philosophical  Interpretation  comparing  Hegel’s  Jena  Logic  with  the  ‘physics’  and
‘metaphysics’  of  Aristotle  will  bring  new  light.  For  the  above  considerations,  some  rough
suggestions will suffice.

Aristotle sees the essence of time in the νῦν, Hegel in the “now”. Aristotle takes the νῦν as όρος;
Hegel takes the “now” as a ‘boundary’. Aristotle understands the νῦν as στιγμή; Hegel interprets the
“now”  as  a  point.  Aristotle  describes  the  νῦν  as  τόδε  τι;  Hegel  calls  the  “now”  the  ‘absolute  this’
Aristotle follows tradition in connecting χρόνος with the σφαίρα; Hegel stresses the ‘circular course’
of time. To be sure, Hegel escapes the central tendency of the Aristotelian analysis—the tendency to
expose a foundational connection (ακολουθείν) between the νῦν, the όρος, the στιγμή, and the τόδε τι.
In its results, Bergson’s view is in accord with Hegel’s thesis that space ‘is’ time, in spite of the
very different reasons they have given. Bergson merely says the reverse: that time (temps) is  space.
Bergson’s view of time too has obviously arisen from an Interpretation of the Aristotelian essay on
time. That a treatise of Bergson with the title Quid Aristoteles de loco senserit should have appeared
at  the  same  time  as  his  Essai  sur  les  données  immédiates  de  la  conscience, where  the  problem  of
temps  and  durée  is  expounded,  is  not  just  a  superficial  literary  connection.  Having  regard  to
Aristotle’s definition of time as the αριθμός κινήσεως, Bergson prefaces his analysis of time with an
analysis  of  number.  Time  as  space  (Cf.  Essai,  p.  69)  is  quantitative  Succession.  By  a  counter-
orientation to this conception of time, duration gets described as qualitative Succession. This is not
the  place  [Ort]  for  coming  to  terms  critically  with  Bergson’s  conception  of  time  or  with  other
Present-day  views  of  it.  So  far  as  anything  essential  has  been  achieved  in  to-day’s  analyses  which
will  take  us  beyond  Aristotle  and  Kant,  it  pertains  more  to  the  way  time  is  grasped  and  to  our

‘consciousness of time’. We shall come back to this in the first and third divisions of Part Two. [The
preceding sentence has been deleted in the later editions.—Tr.]

In suggesting a direct connection between Hegel’s conception of time and Aristotle’s analysis, we
are not accusing Hegel of any ‘dependence’ on Aristotle, but are calling attention to the ontological
import which this filiation has in principle, for the Hegelian logic.

On ‘Aristotle and Hegel’, cf. Nicolai Hartmann’s paper with this title in Beiträge zur Philosophie

des deutschen Idealismus, vol. 3, 1923, pp. 1-36.

 

 

 

(b) Hegel’s Interpretation of the Connection between Time and Spirit

H. 433

If Hegel can say that when spirit gets actualized, it accords with it to fall
into  time,  with  “time”  defined  as  a  negation  of  a  negation,  how  has  spirit
itself been understood? The essence of spirit is the concept. By  this Hegel
understands  not  the  universal  which  is  intuited  in  a  genus  as  the  form  of
something  thought,  but  rather  the  form  of  the  very  thinking  which  thinks
itself: the conceiving of oneself—as the grasping of the not-I. Inasmuch as
the  grasping  of  the  not-I  presents  a  differentiation,  there  lies  in  the  pure
concept,  as  the  grasping  of  this  differentiation,  a  differentiation  of  the
difference.  Thus  Hegel  can  define  the  essence  of  the  spirit  formally  and
apophantically  as  the  negation  of  a  negation.  This  ‘absolute  negativity’
gives a logically formalized Interpretation of Descartes’ “cogito me cogitare
rem”, wherein he sees the essence of the conscientia.

The concept is accordingly a self-conceiving way in which the Self has
been conceived; as thus conceived, the Self is authentically as it can be—
that  is  free.(1)  ‘The  “I”  is  the  pure  concept  itself,  which  as  concept  has
come into Dasein.(xxxi) The “I”, however, is this initially pure unity which
relates  itself  to  itself—not  immediately,  but  in  that  it  abstracts  from  all
determinateness  and  content,  and  goes  back  to  the  freedom  of  its
unrestricted  self-equality.(xxxii)  Thus  the  “I”  is  ‘universality’,  but  it  is
‘individuality’(2) just as immediately.
 

xxxi. Cf. Hegel, Wissenschaft der Logik, vol. II (ed. Lasson, 1923), Part 2, p. 220.
xxxii. Ibid.

1.  ‘Der  Begriff  ist  sonach  die  sich  begreifende  Begriffenheit  des  Selbst,  als  welche  das  Selbst
eigentlich ist, wie es sein kann, das heisst frei.’ The noun ‘Begriffenheit’ is of course derived from
‘begriffen’, the past participle of ‘begreifen’ (‘to conceive’ or ‘to grasp’). ‘Begriffen’, however, may

also be used when we would say that someone is ‘in the process of’ doing something. This would
suggest the alternative translation: ‘The concept is accordingly a self-conceiving activity of the Self
—an activity of such a nature that when the Self performs it, it is authentically as it can be—namely,
free.’

2. ‘ “Einzelheit” ’.We take this reading from Lasson’s edition of Hegel, which Heidegger cites.
The  older  editions  of  Heidegger’s  work  have  ‘Einzelnheit’;  the  newer  ones  have  ‘Einzenheit’.

This negating of the negation is both that which is ‘absolutely restless’ in
the spirit and also its self-manifestation, which belongs to  its essence. The
‘progression’ of the spirit which actualizes itself in history, carries with it ‘a
principle  of  exclusion’.(xxxiii)  In  this  exclusion,  however,  that  which  is
excluded does not get detached from the spirit; it gets surmounted. The kind
of  making-itself-free  which  overcomes  and  at  the  same  time  tolerates,  is
characteristic of the freedom of the spirit. Thus ‘progress’ never signifies a
merely quantitative “more”, but is essentially qualitative and indeed has the
quality  of  spirit.  ‘Progression’  is  done  knowingly  and  knows  itself  in  its
goal.  In  every  step  of  its  ‘progress’  spirit  has  to  overcome  ‘itself’  “as  the
truly malignant obstacle to that goal”.(xxxiv) In its development spirit aims
‘to  reach  its  own  concept’.(xxxv)  The  development  itself  is  ‘a  hard,
unending battle against itself’.(xxxvi)

Because the restlessness with which spirit develops in bringing itself to
its  concept  is  the  negation  of  a  negation,  it  accords  with  spirit,  as  it
actualizes itself, to fall ‘into time’ as the immediate negation of a negation.
For ‘time is the concept itself, which is there [da ist] and which represents
itself  to  the  consciousness  as  an  empty  intuition;  because  of  this,  spirit
necessarily  appears  in  time,  and  it  appears  in  time  as  long  as  it  does  not
grasp its pure concept—that is, as long as time is not annulled by it. Time is
the pure Self-external, intuited, not grasped by the Self—the concept which
is  merely  intuited.’(xxxvii)  Thus  by  its  very  essence  spirit  necessarily
appears in time. ‘World-history is therefore, above all, the interpretation of
spirit in time, just as in space the idea interprets itself as Nature.’(xxxviii)
The  ‘exclusion’  which  belongs  to  the  movement  of  development  harbours
in itself a relationship to not-Being. This is time, understood in terms of the
“now” which gives itself airs.

Time  is  ‘abstract’  negativity.  As  ‘intuited  becoming’,  it  is  the
differentiated self-differentiation which one comes across immediately; it is
the concept which ‘is there’ [“daseiende”]—but this means present-at-hand.
As something present-at-hand and thus external to spirit, time has no power
over the concept, but the concept is rather ‘the power of time’.(xxxix)

By  going  back  to  the  selfsameness  of  the  formal  structure  which  both
spirit and time possess as the negation of a negation, Hegel shows how it is
possible for spirit to be actualized historically ‘in time’. Spirit and time get
disposed  of  with  the  very  emptiest  of  formal-ontological  and  formal-
apophantical  abstractions,  and  this  makes  it  possible  to  produce  a  kinship
between them. But because time simultaneously gets conceived in the sense
of  a  world-time  which  has  been  utterly  levelled  off,  so  that  its  origin
remains  completely  concealed,  it  simply  gets  contrasted  with  spirit—
contrasted as something that is present-at-hand. Because of this, spirit must
first  of  all  fall  ‘into  time’.  It  remains  obscure  what  indeed  is  signified
ontologically  by  this  ‘falling’  or  by  the  ‘actualizing’  of  a  spirit  which  has
power  over  time  and  really  ‘is’  [“seienden”]  outside  of  it.  Just  as  Hegel
casts little light on the source of the time which has thus been levelled off,
he  leaves  totally  unexamined  the  question  of  whether  the  way  in  which
spirit is essentially constituted as the negating of a negation, is possible in
any other manner than on the basis of primordial temporality.

We  cannot  as  yet  discuss  whether  Hegel’s  Interpretation  of  time  and
spirit and the connection between them is correct and rests on foundations
which  are  ontologically  primordial.  But  the  very  fact  that  a  formal-
dialectical  ‘construction’  of  this  connection  can  be  ventured  at  all,  makes
manifest  that  these  are  primordially  akin.  Hegel’s  ‘construction’  was

prompted by his arduous struggle to conceive the ‘concretion’ of the spirit.
He makes this known in the following sentence from the concluding chapter
of his Phenomenology of the Spirit: ‘Thus time appears as the very fate and
necessity which spirit has when it is not in itself complete: the necessity of
its giving self-consciousness a richer share in consciousness, of its setting in
motion the immediacy of the “in-itself” (the  form in  which substance is  in
consciousness), or, conversely, of its realizing and making manifest the “in-
itself”  taken  as  the  inward  (and  this  is  what  first  is  inward)—that  is,  of
vindicating it for its certainty of itself.’(xl)

Our  existential  analytic  of  Dasein,  on  the  contrary,  starts  with  the
‘concretion’  of  factically  thrown  existence  itself  in  order  to  unveil
temporality  as  that  which  primordially  makes  such  existence  possible.
‘Spirit’  does  not  first  fall  into  time,  but  it  exists  as  the  primordial
temporalizing of temporality. Temporality  temporalizes world-time,  within
the  horizon  of  which  ‘history’  can  ‘appear’  as  historizing  within-time.
‘Spirit’ does not fall into time; but factical existence ‘falls’ as falling from
primordial, authentic temporality.(1) This ‘falling’ [“Fallen”], however, has
itself  its  existential  possibility  in  a  mode  of  its  temporalizing—a  mode
which belongs to temporality.
 

1. ‘Der “Geist” fällt nicht in die Zeit, sondern: die faktische Existenz “fällt” als verfallende aus
der  ursprünglichen,  eigentlichen  Zeitlichkeit.’  The  contrast  between  Hegel’s  verb  ‘fallen’  and
Heidegger’s ‘verfallen’ is obscured by our translating them both as ‘fall’. Cf. our note 1, H. 428.

83. The Existential-temporal Analytic of Dasein, and the Question of

Fundamental Ontology as to the Meaning of Being in General
 

In  our  considerations  hitherto,  our  task  has  been  to  Interpret  the
primordial  whole  of  factical  Dasein  with  regard  to  its  possibilities  of
authentic and inauthentic existing, and to do so in an existential-ontological
manner in terms of its very basis. Temporality has manifested itself as this

basis  and  accordingly  as  the  meaning  of  the  Being  of  care.  So  that  which
our  preparatory  existential  analytic  of  Dasein  contributed  before
temporality was laid bare, has now been taken back into temporality as the
primordial structure of Dasein’s totality of Being. In terms of the possible
ways in which primordial time can temporalize itself, we have provided the
‘grounds’  for  those  structures  which  were  just  ‘pointed  out’  in  our  earlier
treatment. Nevertheless, our way of exhibiting the constitution of Dasein’s
Being remains only one way which we may take. Our aim is to work out the
question of Being in general. The thematic analytic of existence, however,
first needs the light of the idea of Being in general, which must be clarified
beforehand. This holds particularly if we adhere to the principle which we
expressed  in  our  introduction  as  one  by  which  any  philosophical
investigation  may 
universal
phenomenological  ontology,  and  takes  its  departure  from  the  hermeneutic
of Dasein, which, as an analytic of existence, has made fast the guiding-line
for  all  philosophical  inquiry  at  the  point  where  it  arises  and  to  which  it
returns.”(xli) This  thesis,  of course,  is  to  be regarded not  as a dogma,  but
rather  as  a  formulation  of  a  problem  of  principle  which  still  remains
‘veiled’: can one provide ontological grounds for ontology, or does it also
require an ontical foundation? and which entity must take over the function
of poviding this foundation?

The  distinction  between  the  Being  of  existing  Dasein  and  the  Being  of
entities,  such  as  Reality,  which  do  not  have  the  character  of  Dasein,  may
appear  very  illuminating;  but  it  is  still  only  the  point of  departure  for  the
ontological  problematic;  it  is  nothing  with  which  philosophy  may
tranquillize itself. It has long been known that ancient ontology works with
‘Thing-concepts’ and that there is a danger of ‘reifying consciousness’. But
what does this “reifying” signify? Where does it arise? Why does Being get
‘conceived’ ‘proximally’ in terms of the present-at-hand and not in terms of
the  ready-to-hand,  which  indeed  lies  closer  to  us?  Why does  this  reifying
always keep coming back to exercise its dominion? What positive structure
does the Being of ‘consciousness’ have, if reification remains inappropriate

to it? Is the ‘distinction’ between ‘consciousness’ and ‘Thing’ sufficient for
tackling  the  ontological  problematic  in  a  primordial  manner?  Do  the
answers  to  these  questions  lie  along  our  way?  And  can  we  even  seek  the
answer  as  long  as  the  question  of  the  meaning  of  Being  remains
unformulated and unclarified?

One can never carry on researches into the source and the possibility of
the  ‘idea’  of  Being  in  general  simply  by  means  of  the  ‘abstractions’  of
formal logic—that is, without any secure horizon for question and answer.
One  must  seek  a  way  of  casting  light  on  the  fundamental  question  of
ontology, and this is the way one must go. Whether this is the only way  or
even the right one at all, can be decided only after  one has gone along  it.
The conflict as to the Interpretation of Being cannot be allayed, because  it
has not yet been enkindled. And in  the  end this is  not  the  kind  of conflict
one  can  ‘bluster  into’;  it  is  of  the  kind  which  cannot  get  enkindled  unless
preparations are made for it. Towards this alone the foregoing investigation
is on the way. And where does this investigation stand?

Something  like  ‘Being’  has  been  disclosed  in  the  understanding-of-
Being which belongs to existent Dasein as a way in which it understands.
Being  has  been  disclosed  in  a  preliminary  way,  though  non-conceptually;
and  this  makes  it  possible  for  Dasein  as  existent  Being-in-the-world  to
comport itself towards entities—towards those which it encounters within-
the-world  as  well  as  towards  itself  as  existent.  How  is  this  disclosive
understanding  of  Being  at  all  possible  for  Dasein?  Can  this  question  be
answered  by  going  back  to  the  primordial  constitution-of-Being  of  that
Dasein  by  which  Being 
is  understood?  The  existential-ontological
constitution  of  Dasein’s  totality  is  grounded  in  temporality.  Hence  the
ecstatical  projection  of  Being  must  be  made  possible  by  some  primordial
way in which ecstatical temporality temporalizes. How is this mode of the
temporalizing of temporality to be Interpreted? Is there a way which leads
from  primordial  time  to  the  meaning  of  Being?  Does  time  itself  manifest
itself as the horizon of Being?

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

 

Martin Heidegger (September 26, 1889 – May 26, 1976) was a German
philosopher known for his existential and phenomenological explorations of
the “question of Being”.

His  best  known  book,  Being  and  Time,  is  considered  one  of  the  most
important  philosophical  works  of  the  20th  century.  In  it  and  later  works,
Heidegger  maintained that our way  of questioning defines our nature. But
philosophy,  Western  Civilization’s  chief  way  of  questioning,  had  in  the
process  of  philosophizing  lost  sight  of  the  being  it  sought.  Finding
ourselves  “always  already”  fallen  in  a  world  of  presuppositions,  we  lose
touch  with  what  being  was  before  its  truth  became  “muddled”.  As  a
solution  to  this  condition,  Heidegger  advocated  a  return  to  the  practical
being  in  the  world,  allowing  it  to  reveal,  or  “unconceal”  itself  as
concealment.

Writing  extensively  on  Nietzsche  in  his  later  career,  and  offering  a
“phenomenological  critique  of  Kant”  in  his  Kant  and  the  Problem  of
Metaphysics,  Heidegger  is  known  for  his  post-Kantian  philosophy.
Heidegger’s influence has been far reaching, from philosophy to theology,
deconstructionism, literary theory, architecture, and artificial intelligence.

Heidegger  is  a  controversial  figure,  largely  for  his  affiliation  with
Nazism,  for  which  he  never  apologized  nor  expressed  regret,  except  in
private  when  he  called  it  “the  biggest  stupidity  of  his  life”  (die  größte
Dummheit  seines  Lebens).  The  so-called  Heidegger  controversy  raises
general  questions  about  the  relation  between  Heidegger’s  thought  and  his
connection to National Socialism.

a  New  Suburban  Community

Ways of Life and Politics 
in a New Suburban Community 


Introduction 

they lived in, driven into a  never ending round of group activity 
ruled by the strictest conformity. Suburbanites were incapable of 
real  friendships;  they were bored and lonely, alienated, atomized, 
and depersonalized. As  the myth grew,  it added yet  more disturb-
ing  elements:  the  emergence  of  a  matriarchal  family  of  domi-
neering  wives,  absent  husbands,  and  spoiled  children,  and  with 
it,  rising  marital  friction,  adultery,  divorce,  drunkenness,  and 
mental  illness.~  In  unison,  the  authors  chanted  that  individual-
ism  was  dying,  suburbanites  were  miserable,  and  the  fault  lay 
with  the  homogeneous  suburban  landscape  and  its  population. 
John  Keats,  perhaps  the  most  hysterical  of  the  mythmakers, 
began his  book as  follows:  "For literally  nothing down  ... you 
too can find a  box of your own in one of the fresh-air slums we're 
building around  the  edges  of American cities  .  .  .  inhabited by 
people whose  age  income,  number of children,  problems,  habits, 
conversation,  dress,  possessions  and  perhaps  even  blood  type  are 
also  precisely  like  yours . . . .  )They  are[  developments  con-
ceived  in  error,  nurtured  by  greed,  corroding  everything  they 
touch.  They  . . .  actually drive mad myriads of  housewives shut 
up in  them." e 

Subsequently,  literary  and  social  critics  chimed  in.  Although 
they  wrote  little  about  suburbia  per  se,  articles  and  reviews  on 
other  subjects  repeated  what  they  had  learned  from  the  mass 
media, dropping asides  that suburbia was  intellectually debilitat-
ing,  culturally  oppressive,  and  politically  dangerous,  breeding 
bland mass men without respect for  the arts or democracy. 7  They 
were  joined by architects and city planners who accused  the sub-
urbs and their builders of ruining the countryside, strangling the 
cities,  causing  urban  sprawl,  and  threatening  to  make  America 
into one vast Los Angeles by the end of the century. 8 

I  watched  the  growth  of  this  mythology  with  misgivings,  for 
my  observations  in  various  new  suburbs  persuaded  me  neither 
that  there  was  much  change  in  people  when  they  moved  to  the 
suburbs nor that  the change which  took  place could  be  traced  to 
the  new  environment.  And  if  suburban  life  was  as  undesirable 
and unhealthy as  the critics charged, the suburbanites themselves 
were  blissfully  unaware  of  it;  they  were  happy  in  their  new 
homes  and  communities,  much  happier  than  they  had  been  in 
the city.  Some of the observations about suburbia were quite ac-
curate, and  the  critics  represented  a  wide  range of  political  and 
cultural viewpoints, so  that it is  perhaps unfair to lump them all

together-although  I  do  so  as  a  shorthand  in  the  chapters  that 
follow.  Nevertheless,  it seemed  to me  that a  basic  inaccuracy was 
being perpetrated by those  who give American society its  picture 
of itself, and when I learned that city planners also swallowed the 
suburban  myth  and  were  altering  their  professional  recommen-
dations  accordingly,  I  felt  it  was  time  to  do  a  study  of  the  new 
suburbs.  Lacking  the  grants  to do  a  large  comparative  study  of 
several  communities  that  was-and still  is--needed,  and  leaning 
toward participant-observation by my training, I  decided the best 
way  to do the  research was  to live  in  one such community.  That 
community turned out to be Levittown, New Jersey. 

THE  SETI'ING 

When  I  first  began  to  think  about  the  study,  I  learned  that 
Levitt  and  Sons,  Inc.,  then  building  Levittown,  Pennsylvania, 
were planning to build yet another new community in the Phila-
delphia area.  The  firm  was  then,  as  now,  the  largest  builder  in 
the eastern  United States, and Levittown was  even  then a  proto-
type  of  postwar  suburbia.9  Hair raising  stories  about  the  homo-
geneity  of  people  and  conformity  of  life  in  the  first  two  Levit-
towns made it clear that if any of the evils described by the critics 
of suburbia actually existed, they would be found in a Levittown. 
Moreover,  Levitt  was  building  communities  and  not  just  sub-
divisions,  which  meant that  the entire range  of local  institutions 
and  facilities  typically associated with a  community would be es-
tablished  de  novo;  the  firm  was  offering  relatively  inexpensive 
houses,  which  meant  that  the  community  would  attract  both 
middle  and working class  people. 10 

In  I955· Levitt announced that he had purchased almost all of 
Willingboro  Township,  New  Jersey,  a  sparsely  settled  agricul-
tural  area  seventeen  miles  from  Philadelphia,  and  that  building 
would begin as  soon  as  Levittown,  Pennsylvania,  was  completed. 
The newest  Levittown was  to  be a  full-fledged  community,  with 
at least  I 2,ooo  houses,  and because Levitt had bought almost  the 
entire  township,  with  its  own  government  as  well.  Three  basic 
house  types,  costing  from  $I I,5oo  to  $I4,500  would  be  built  on 
the  same  street  and  organized  into  separate  neighborhoods  of 
about  I 200  homes,  each  served  by  an  elementary  school,  play-
ground,  and  swimming  pool.  The  complex  of  ten  or  twelve 
neighborhoods  would  be complemented  by  a  set  of community-

Introduction 

wide  facilities,  including a  large  shopping  center,  some  smaller 
oqes, and of course high schools,  a library, and parks; and some of 
these would be provided by the builder. 

On  a  sunny  Saturday  in  June  1958,  Levittown  was  officially 
opened to  potential  purchasers, and that day my wife and I  were 
among  hundreds  of  others  who  looked  over  the  houses.  Since  I 
wanted  to  be  among  the  very  first  residents,  we  selected  the 
model we  liked best,  a  four-bedroom  "Cape Cod,"  and made the 
required  down  payment  of  $100.  A  few  weeks  later,  the  first 
group of about  100 purchasers was asked to come to Levittown to 
pick a  lot,  and we  chose  one  in  the  middle  of  a  short block-to 
make  sure  that  we  would  literally  be  in  the  middle  of  things. 
During the second week of October, we  were among the first  25 
families  who  moved  into  the  new community-none of  them,  I 
was pleased to discover, coming to study it. 11 

THE  THEORY  OF  THE  STUDY 

The  study  I  ·Wanted  to  do  focused  around  three  major  but  in-
terrelated questions:  the origin of a new community,  the quality 
of suburban life, and the effect of suburbia on the behavio:rof.its 
residents. Later, I  added a  fourth question on the quality of pol-
itics and decision-making. 

My first  task was  to determine the processes which transform a 
group of strangers into a community, to see if I couldide11tify the 
essential prerequisites for "community." But I also wanted to test 
the  critics'  charge  that  the  Levittowns  were  inflicted  on  pur-
chasers  with  little  choice  of  other  housing  by  a  profit-minded 
builder  unwilling  to  provide  them  with  a  superior  home  and 
community.  Consequently,  I  intended  to  study how  the commu-
nity  was  planned:  to  what  extent  the  plans  were  shaped  by 
Levitt's  goals  and  to  what  extent  by  the  goals  of  the  expected 
purchasers.  For  this  purpose,  I  needed  also  to  study  the  pur-
chasers-why  they  were  moving  to  Levittown  and  what  aspira-
tions  they  had  for  life  in  the  new  community.  Once  they  had 
moved in,  I  wanted to  observe the community formation  process 
from  the  same  perspective:  how  much  specific  groups  were 
shaped by their founders,  how much by their members, and how 
much by the group's function for  the larger community.  I  hoped 
to know after several  years  to what extent the emerging commu-
nity reflected  the priorities of  builder, founders,  and other com-

munity  leaders  and  to  what  extent  the  goals  for  which  people 
said they had moved to Levittown. 

These questions were grounded in a  set of theoretical issues of 
relevance  to  both  social  science  and  public  policy.  Sociologists 
have long been asking what and who bring about innovation and 
social change, and what role elite leaders and experts, on the one 
hand,  and  the  rank·and-file citizenry,  on  the  other,  play  in  this 
process.  As a  policy matter,  the same question has been raised by 
the concept of mass  society, which  implies that many features  of 
American  society-whether  television  programs,  Levittowns,  or 
Pentagon  policies-are  imposed  by  an  intentional  or  uninten-
tional conspiracy of business and governmental leaders acting on 
passive  or resigned  Americans who  actually  want something en-
tirely different. 

This issue is  of more than academic interest to makers of com-
munity  policy,  be  they  politicians  or  city  planners.  The  city 
planner  is  an  expert with  a  conception  of  the  ideal  community 
and good life, which he seeks  to translate into reality through his 
professional  activities.  If a  small  number  of  leaders  shape  the 
community, he need only proselytize them effectively to establish 
his  conception.  If the  residents  themselves  determine  the  com-
munity,  however,  he is  faced  with a  more difficult  task:  persuad-
ing  them  of  the  desirability  of  his  plans  or  somehow  changing 
their  behavior  to  accord  with  them.  The further and normative 
issue  is  even  more  perplexing:  whose  values  should  shape  the 
new community, the residents' or the planner's? 12 

The second question of  the study sought to  test  the validity of 
the  suburban  critique,  whether  suburban  ways  of  life  were  as 
undesirable  as  had  been  claimed.  Are  people  status-seekers,  do 
they engage in a  hyperactive social  life  which  they  do not really 
enjoy,  do  they  conform  unwillingly  to  the  demands  of  their 
neighbors,  is  the  community a  dull  microcosm  of  mass  society? 
Are  the women  bored and lonely matriarchs, and does  suburban 
life produce the malaise and mental  illness which  the critics pre-
dicted?  And  if  not,  what  dissatisfactions  and  problems  do  de-
velop? 

The  third  question  followed  logically  from  the  second:  were 
undesirable  changes  (and  desirable  ones  too)  an  effect  ofthe 
move  from  city  to  suburb  or  of  causes  unrelated  to  either  the 
move  or  suburbia?  My  previous  observations  led  me  to  suspect 
that the changes were less  a  result of suburban residence than of

aspirations  for  individual  and  family  life  which  enco!JJ'(l_ged 
people to move  to the suburbs in the first  place.  Consequently, I 
wanted  to  discover  whether  the  changes  people  rePQ!!_~ after 
coming to Levittown were intended, planned by them before the 
move,  or  unintended,  encouraged or forced  on  them afterwards 
by  the  community.  If unintended changes outweighed  intended 
ones,  the_community  probably  had  significant effects  on J~ resi-
dents.  And if so,  what sources  and agents within  the community 
created them-the physical environment of suburbia, the distance 
from  urban  facilities,  the  social  structure  and  the  people  who 
made  it,  andjor the  builder or organizational  founder? 

The  theoretical  issue  about  the  impact of  the community has 
long  been  debated  within  sociology,  the  ecologists  arguing  that 
the local  economy and geography shape the behavior of the com-
munity's  residents;  the  cultural  sociologists  suggesting- ihat  the 
c~mmunity and  its residents'  behavior are  largely a  reflection  of 
regional  and  national social  structures.18  The policy issue  is  re-
lated  to  the  previous  one.  If there  is  no change  in  people's  be-
havior when they move  to the suburbs,  then public policy which 
alters only the community, such as city planning, may be ineffec-
tive.  The same is  true if changes are mainly intended. If they are 
mainly unintended, however, and  the community has  impact on 
people's  lives,  then  policy  to  change  the  community  will  also 
change  their lives.  And  if the sources of change can be traced  to 
the  physical  environment,  the  city  planner's concern  with  alter-
ing that ehironment is justified;  if they lie in the social environ-
ment,  then  social  planning  would  be  more  effective.  But  if  in-
tended changes  predominate,  public  policy would  have  to affect 
the  aspirations  with  which  people  come  to  the  community and 
the more fundamental sources of these aspirations.  Of course, all 
this assumes  that policy change is  needed,  which requires a  prior 
determination of what is  harmful or in need of improvement in 
suburban life. 

As part of my study of the quality of life, I  had intended to re-
search  political  life as  well,  and as  part of the  inquiry into orig-
ins,  to find  out how much attention elected officials  paid to feed-
back from the: voters-whether the body politic was being created 
by  political  leaders  on  their  own  or  in  response  to  resident  de-
mands.  In  the  course  of  my  research  I  became  aware  of  what 
should have been obvious all along:  that the community was also 
being shaped  by  the decisions  of its  governing body,  and that  I

needed  to  study who  was  making  them  and  how,  and  to  deter-
mine what role  the planner and other kinds of experts played in 
the  decision-making  process.  I  wanted  particularly  to  find  out 
how  much  leeway  the  decision-makers  had  for  unpopular  deci-
sions,  especially those  termed "in the public interest"  by experts 
and  planners.  Underlying  the  empirical  question  was  another 
normative  one:  whether  government  should  be  responsive  and 
democratic,  and  when  it  should  make  unpopular  decisions  to 
preserve  the  public  interest  as  well  as  the  rights  of  powerless 
minorities. 

All  four questions  ultimately boil down  to a  single one about 
the process of change and the possibility of innovation in a social 
system.  They all  ask  how  change can  be brought about, whether 
the major initiators are the leaders or the led,  and what role the 
planner or any other expert policy-maker can play.  And they also 
ask,  normatively  speaking,  what  changes  are  desirable,  partic-
ularly when they conflict with the actions or wishes of the major-
ity  of residents.  These  questions  are,  of course,  relevant  to  any 
community, but they are raised more easily in a new cemmunity, 
where all  social  and  political  processes can  be  traced from  their 
very beginning. 

I  should note that when I  began my research, I  had not formu-
lated the questions as  clearly or compactly as  they are  here writ-
ten, and I  had no intention of limiting myself only to them.  One 
of the major pleasures of participant-observation is to come upon 
unexpected new topics of study, and these are reflected in the oc-
casional  tangential analyses  that occur throughout the book. 

THE  METIIODS  OF  THE  STUDY 

The main  source  of data  was  to  be  participant-observation.  By 
living in the community for  the first  two years,  I  planned to ob-
serve the development of neighbor relations and social life and to 
be on  hand  when  organizations  and  institutions  were  being set 
up.  In addition to observing at public meetings,  I  would also  be 
able to interview founders and members, and once having gotten 
to  know  them,  follow  their  groups  as  they  went  through  their 
birth  pains.  Meanwhile  I  would  do  much  the  same  with 
churches,  governmental  public  bodies,  and  political  parties;  I 
would talk to doctors,  lawyers,  local  reporters, and  the Levitt ex-
ecutives,  as  well.  Eventually  I  would get  to  know  all  the  impor-

tant  people  and  a  sizeable  sample  of  other  residents,  and  inter-
view  them from  time to time as  the community building process 
unfolded.  The  nature  of  everyday  life  I  would  discover  princi-
pally on my own street, where I  could observe my neighbors and 
myself  in  our  roles  as  homeowners  and  block  residents.  These 
plans came  to fruition,  and  I  spent  most  of my  days  making the 
rounds of the community to find  out what was  happening, much 
like  a  reporter.  For a  year  after  organizations  first  sprang up,  I 
went to at least one meeting every week night. 

Although  observation  would  also  provide  some  data  on  the 
community's effects on people, and on their feelings  about Levit-
town  and  their  problems,  it  would  not  allow  me  to  contact  a 
large and random enough sample.  Consequently, I  planned to in-
terview such a sample shortly before moving in,  to find  out what 
aspirations  they were bringing to  the community, and again  two 
years  later,  to determine what intended and unintended changes 
had  occurred  in  their  lives.  The  shortage  of  funds  made  the 
sample  smaller  than  I  had  wished,  but  forty-five  respondents 
were  interviewed  twice,  mainly  by  graduate  students  from  the 
University  of  Pennsylvania.  As  the  sample  included  too  few 
former  city  dwellers  for  even  a  rudimentary  statistical  analysis, 
fifty-five  ex-Philadelphians  were  interviewed  as  well,  but  only 
once.  And  being unable  to  persuade  the  builder to give  me  the 
names of purchasers before they moved  in,  I  had to schedule the 
initial  interview  with  the  first  sample  shortly  after  they  ar-
rived.14  The  builder  did,  however,  send  out  a  prearrival  mail 
questionnaire  for  me,  which  ultimately went  to  3100  purchasers 
(a  record-breaking  two  thirds  of  whom  filled  it  out),  and  pro-
vided  much  of  the  data  on  the  Levittowners,  their  moving 
reasons, and aspirations reported in Chapter Two.u Whenever I 
report statistical  findings  about people's  behavior,  the data come 
from  the mail questionnaire  (particularly in Chapter Two), and 
from  the  interviews  (particularly  in Part  Two).  Further  details 
about  the questions  themselves  and  about  the limitations of  the 
mail  questionnaire,  interview,  and  participant-observation  find-
ings  will  be  found  in  appropriate  places  in  the  text  and  in  the 
Appe·  -:lix. 

My  previous  participant-observation  research  had  convinced 
me that my role in Levittown would be more an observer's  than 
a  participant's.  Participating is  undoubtedly the best way  to dis-
cover what is  really going on, but becoming a  participant in one 

I ntroducticm 
group automatically  excludes  the  researcher  from  learning  any-
thing  about  what  is  going  on  in  competing  or  opposing  ones. 
Consequently,  I  decided  I  would  participate  only  in  the  life  of 
my  own  block  and  as  a  member of  the  public at meetings,  but 
that otherwise my role would be that of an.observer and informal 
interviewer.

As soon as  I  moved in,  I  told people I  was on the faculty of the 
University  of  Pennsylvania  and  that  I  would  do  a  study  of  the 
community  formation  process  in  Levittown.  Having  learned 
from  previous  experience  that  it is  difficult  to  explain sociology 
meaningfully to  people,  I  usually described my research  as  a  his-
torical study.  I did not go into detail about it-I was rarely asked 
to-and  I  did  not  tell  people  on  my  block  that  I  was  keeping 
notes  on  their  (and  my)  activities  as  homeowners  and  neigh-
bors.  To have done so would have made life unpleasant for them 
and for me.  I  disclaimed association with  the mail questionnaire 
or  the  interviews  on  behavior  change,  fearing  (probably  un· 
necessarily)  that  I  might  be  rejected  as  a  participant-observer. 
Finally I  did not  tell  people  I  had moved  to Levittown in order 
to  do  the  study.  Actually,  it  would  not  have  occurred  to  them 
that  I  was  not simply interested  in a  good  low-priced  house  and 
the chance to enjoy suburban living. 

Aside  from  these  deceptions,  being a  participant-observer  was 
almost  always  enjoyable  and  often  exciting.  I  liked  most  of  the 
people  I  met  and  had  no  trouble  in  getting  information  from 
them.  Identifying  myself  as  a  researcher  did  not  inhibit  them 
from  talking,  but  then  I  asked  few  personal  questions;  being as 
curious as  I  about the evolution of a  new community,  they were 
willing  and  often  eager  to  have  me  sit  in  at  meetings  or  inter-
view  them.  After a  while,  I  became a  fixture  in the community; 
people forgot  I  was  there and went on with  their business,  even 
at  private  political  gatherings.  I  was  always  welcomed  at  public 
meetings,  especially  when  citizen  attendance  was  low.  Needing 
an audience,  public officials  were  glad  to  forget  I  was  there  as  a 
researcher.  Indeed,  I  was  once publicly  praised  for  my steady at-
tendance. 

Most people enjoy being studied;  it means  they are  important 
and it flatters  them. Since I was always collecting information but 
never  published  anything,  however,  people  could  not  check  on 
me as  they can on a  reporter, and some of the politicians became 
suspicious  of  what  I  would  eventually  write.  "Will  it  be  like 

•  XXXVI

Introduction 

Peyton  Place?"  a  couple  of  them  once  asked  jokingly.  I  wise-
cracked back  that I  would be glad to include similar material on 
local  incest if they could provide the data, but realizing that their 
jokes hid  some concern about  my publishing  political  and other 
community intrigues, I  made it clear that I  would not use names 
in the book. 

I  tried not to act like a  formal  researcher and rarely took notes 
during  the  thousands  of  informal  conversational  interviews.  In-
stead  I  memorized  the  answers,  made  quick  notes  as  soon  as  I 
could, and later wrote the whole interview in my field diary.  (Al-
though a famous novelist has recently garnered considerable pub-
licity for  memorizing his  interviews,  this  has  long been standard 
practice  for  many  sociologists.)  Social  occasions  were  a  fruitful 
source of data about community attitudes,  but I  was always care-
ful  not  to ask  too  many questions  or questions  inappropriate  to 
the  neighborly role.  I  recall  feeling  frustrated  about  this  at one 
social gathering, only to hear a  neighbor ask exactly the questions 
I  felt  I could not ask.  This made me wonder about the similarity 
between sociology and  gossip,  but  then  she  was  the block's  nosy 
neighbor.  Actually,  in  life  on  the  block  I  often acted  spontane-
ously as  a  neighbor,  and only after  I  got  horne  would  I  become 
the  researcher  again,  writing  down  my  and  my  neighbors'  con-
versations and activities. 

The main problem in being a participant-observer is not to get 
people  to  give  information,  but  to  live  with  the  role  day  after 
day.  As  a  researcher,  I  could not afford to alienate any present or 
potential  sources,  or become  identified  with any single group or 
clique in the community. Consequently,  I  had to be neutral, not 
offering opinions on controversial local  issues  or on national  pol-
itics if they  were  too different from  prevailing opinions--as  they 
often were.  Even  in social  situations,  I  could never  be quite my-
self, and I  had to be careful not to take a dominant role. The life 
of  the  party  makes  a  poor  participant-observer,  but  being  shy 
anyway,  I  did  not  have  to  pretend.  I  also  had  to  restrain  the 
normal temptation to avoid people I did not like, for had I given 
in, my sample would have  been  biased and my conclusions inac-
curate.  The participant-observer must talk  to a  fairly representa-
tive  cross  section  of  the  population.  I  had  to  be  sure  not  to  act 
like  a  professor,  for  fear  of  losing  access  to  people  who  feel 
threatened  by  academic  degrees  or  by  their  own  lack  of educa-
tion. This was not too difficult, for  I  am not entirely comfortable 

Introduction

in  a  professorial  role  anyway.  And  having  enough  interest  in 
small  talk  about  sports,  sex,  automobiles,  weather,  and  other 
staples of  male conversation,  I  had  no difficulty  in  participating 
in the regular evening and Saturday morning bull sessions on the 
front lawn.  Relaxed conversation with women was  more difficult, 
except  in  a  group  of couples,  and  observing  women's  meetings 
was  out of the question.  Perhaps they would have let me  in,  but 
we  would  all  have  been  uncomfortable.  However,  wo91en  en-
joyed  being  interviewed-they  liked  having  their  h6usework 
interrupted-and I could always go to see anyone I wished to find 
out what happened at their meetings. 

A  participant-observer  is  much  like  a  politician,  for  he  must 
always  watch  his  words  and  his  behavior,  think  about  the  next 
question  to  ask,  and  plan  strategy  for  studying  a  prospective 
event.  There was  anxiety  too,  about  figuring  out what  to  study 
and  what  not  to  study,  and  particularly  about  the  possibility  of 
missing  something important that  could  not  be  retrieved  in  the 
rapid flow  of events.  I also felt guilty sometimes about not telling 
people why  I  was asking questions and about the deceptions that 
inevitably  accompany  the  research  role,  but  I  felt  secure  in  the 
knowledge  that none of the information  so  gathered would  ever 
be  used  against  anyone. 

Yet even  the strain of playing a  role  that inhibits one's person-
ality is  more  than matched  by  the  excitement of doing research, 
watching  society  from  close  up,  seeing  the  textbook  social  proc-
esses  in  operation,  and  constantly  getting  ideas  about  social 
theory  from  what  people  say and  do.  There  was  enjoyment  in 
meeting many hundreds of people, and above all,  in being in the 
middle of and in on things.  Often, I  felt I  was watching dozens of 
continuing  serials,  some  pitting  heroes  against  villains,  others 
with temporary cliff-hanger endings,  but all  of  them stimulating 
my  curiosity  as  to  how  they  would  come  out.  And  before  one 
serial  was  over,  several  others  were  sure  to  have  begun.  This  is 
why  I  could  never  answer  properly  when  city  people  asked  me 
whether I  really  enjoyed living in Levittown.  I  did enjoy it,  but 
as  a  researcher,  I  was  not a  normal  resident.  Had  I  been  one,  I 
would  have  enjoyed  the  many  opportunities  for  community  ac-
tivity which came my  way  (partly  because of my training  in city 
planning)-all of which I  had to turn down as  a  researcher-but 
sometimes I found the community personally unsatisfying because 
of  the  shortage  of  people  and  facilities  to  meet  my  own  intel-

Introduction 

lectual  and  cultural  needs.  Even  so,  I  would  not  judge  Levit-
town,  or any community,  negatively simply  because  it could not 
fully satisfy my personal needs. 

Studying the quality of life  implies evaluation,  and this means 
personal  value  judgments.  I  was  guided  by  at  least  three.  First 
and  foremost,  my  evaluation  reflects  the  standards  of  the  resi-
dents themselves, for I  begin with the judgment that, more often 
than not,  they  are  the  best authority of  the quality of  their  own 
life.  In  a  pluralistic  society,  there  is  no  single  standard  for  the 
good  life,  and  in  a  democratic  one,  people  have  the right  to  set 
their  own.  For  example,  if  Levittowners  report  that  they  find 
their community satisfying.  as  they do,  their opinion ought to  be 
respected. Although the suburban critics insist  that these satisfac-
tions are spurious and self-deceptive, they offer no valid evidence, 
so  that  their  charge  only  indicates  their  differing  standards  for 
the  good  life.  Of course,  if  the  Levittowners'  statements  include 
latent  suggestions  of  dissatisfaction,  something  is  clearly  wrong. 
Implicit in this value judgment is  a second which goes  beyond 
the  dictates  of  pluralism  and  democracy.  Specifically,  I  believe 
that  there  are  an  infinite  number  of  ways  of  living well  and of 
coping with  problems, all  of them valid unless they hurt the peo-
ple  practicing  them  or  others.  Our  society  generates  too  much 
social  criticism  consisting  essentially  of  complaints  that  people 
are not  behaving as  the critics  would  like  or themselves  behave. 
Without  proof  that  certain  behavior  is  pathological  for  indi-
vidual  or society,  such criticism can  be rejected for  what it is,  an 
objection to diversity and pluralism. 

But it would be foolhardy  to base an evaluation solely on what 
people  say,  for  if  sociology  has  discovered  anything,  it  is  that 
often people do not know all they are doing or what is happening 
to  them. The observer always  sees  more than anyone else,  if only 
because that is  his job, but if he evaluates what he alone sees,  he 
must still do so by the standards of the people whom he is observ-
ing.  Of course,  here and there I  make personal  judgments which 
do not practice what I  have just preached and which reject one or 
another of  the  Levittowners'  standards.  At  the conscious level,  I 
have  limited  myself  to  those  judgments  which  I  consider  of 
higher  importance  than  the  Levittowners'  standards-including 
the  practice  of  democracy-but  unconscious  judgments  surely 
creep  in  too.  One cannot  live  intimately  with  a  community for 
several  years  without  making  them,  and  I  only  regret  not  being 
aware of those that might bias the study unduly.

In  later chapters,  I  also  make a  number of recommendations. 
Most are not spectacular, for although I  can be as  radical as any-
one  else,  I  feel  that  proposals  which  run  totally  counter  to  the 
standards  of  the  people  who  are  asked  to  implement  them  and 
which  have  little  chance  of  implementation  in  the  foreseeable 
future are utopian  in the negative sense.  Being radical can some-
times be a  conformist ploy  to maintain one's social  standing and 
self-image  in radical circles.  Most of the proposals relate to Levit-
town  as  it  existed  during  the  time  of  my  fieldwork,  and  should 
not  be  taken  as  recommendations for  today,  unless  a  restudy  in-
dicates  (as  it  probably  would)  that  the  community  has  not 
changed significantly since the beginning of the decade. Finally, I 
have  tried to  keep analysis and evaluation separate,  because I  be-
lieve  that  the  former  is  more  than  a  rationalization  or  elabora-
tion  of  my  value  judgments;  most  of  my  findings  would  have 
been  reached  by  another  social  scientist  starting  from  different 
value judgments.  Obviously,  the analysis is objective only in rela-
tion  to  the  methods  and  concepts  I  have  used  and  to  the  judg-
ments which determined  them,  but  in  that  sense,  I  believe  it  is 
objective. 

The  book  tells,  then,  what  I  learned  during  the  two  years  I 
lived  in  Levittown  (October  1958-September  1g6o),  in  the  year 
I  did  additional  fieldwork  without  living  there  (September 
1g6o-june  1961),  and  in  the  years  covered  by  the  effects  inter-
views  (1g6o-Ig62).  Wherever  possible,  I  have  used  newspaper 
articles and data from  Levittown informants to report important 
events that have occurred since then.

the  suburbs)  and  Henderson,  Allen,  Burton,  Spectorsky,  Keats, 
ami more  recently,  Wyden.  A  Sunday supplement,  Suburbia  To-

suburbs, like Otis Carney's How  the Bough Breaks; melodramatic 
ones  like John McPartland's No Down  Payment,  later made into 
a  movie;  and  humorous  ones like  Mergendahl's;  plays,  for  exam-
ple, Man in the Dog Suit; and even an opera, Leonard Bernstein's 
Trouble  in  Tahiti.  Levittown  was  often  the  site,  by  implication 
in  Mergendahl's  book,  and  explicitly  in  a  half-hour  television 
comedy  series,  (never  produced)  called  The  Man  Who  Came  to 
Levittown.  While  most  of  today's  television  situation  comedies 
are set in the suburbs,  they  are  not so identified and do not  deal 
with problems  they describe  as  suburban.

of suburbia, see Strauss, Chaps.  10 and u; Dobriner (1968), Chap. 
1;  Riesman  (1964);  and  Berger  (1966). 

5·  On mental illness see James, and a full-length study which became 
a  best-seller, by Gordon, Gordon, and Gunther. The myth of sub-
urban  adultery,  which  can  probably  be  traced  to  century-old 
novels  about  upper  and  upper  middle  class  unfaithfulness,  has 
spawned a  flood  of strenuously erotic paperbacks which still keep 
coming, although the output of other suburban literature has now 
abated.  See  e.g.,  John  Conway's  Love  in  Suburbia,  subtitled 
"They  Spiced  Their  Lives  with  Other  Men's  Wives,"  or  Dean 
McCoy's  The  Development,  advertised  as  "a biting  novel  which 
strips  bare  the  flimsy  fa~ade  of  decency  concealing  unbridled 
sensual  desires  of  America's sprawling Suburbia." 

6.  Keats  (1957),  p. 7· 
7·  Although  most  sociologists  doubted  the  myth,  some  accepted 
parts  of  it,  e.g.,  Gruenberg,  Duhl,  Riesman  (1957),  and  Stein, 
Chaps. 9 and 12. Interestingly enough, "serious" novelists have not 
written  about  suburbia.  George  Elliott's  Parktilden  Village  and 
Bruce Jay Friedman's Stem  are set in suburban  housing  projects 
and  reflect  the  suburban  myth,  but  deal  even  less  with  repre-
sentative  and recognizable  suburbanites  than  the  popular  novel-
ists. 

8.  For example,  Mumford,  Chap.  16;  Blake;  and  Gruen,  Chap.  5· 
9·  Actually,  most  of  the  suburban  building  had  taken  the  form  of 
subdivisions on the fringe of established communities rather  than 
new communities,  so  that Levittown  was  in  many  ways  atypical. 
It was  a  prototype  largely  because  it had  become  the  symbol  of 
modem  suburbia  among  the  critics,  journalists,  novelists,  and 
moviemakers concerned with  the subject. 

10.  My  study was  formulated  in  the affluent society  of  the mid-1950s 
and I  was then especially interested in wheth~r (and how) working 
class  people  were  acculturating  to  middle  clasa  life  styles.  If the 
move from city to suburb created major changes in people's lives, 
I  thought  they  would  be  most  apparent  among  working  class 
people moving to a middle class  suburb and could  best be atudied 
there,  provided  one could  distinguish  between  change• resulting 
from  social mobility and changes resulting from  the move.  There 
were  too few  working class  Levittownen  to  limit my  research  to

them, but some  years later, Berger  (1960)  studied a  working class 
suburb, covering many of the topics in which I  was interested. 
11.  Later,  I  would have welcomed sharing my  task with other partic-
ipant-observers,  but  at  that  time,  I  was  unsure  about  people's 
feelings toward a  resident researcher and  thought that more  than 
one  sociologist  in  the  community  would  make  the  research  too 
visible.  I  was  wrong,  because  the  community  was  large  enough 
and  the  neighborhoods  separate  enough,  and  because  after  a 
while the researcher became part of the daily scene and faded into 
invisibility. 

12.  This question was also  evoked by a  study I  had just participated 
in: on the issue of whether municipal services ought to be planned 
according  to  the priorities  of those  who  supplied  them  (the  pro-
fessional  educators,  recreationists,  public  health  officials,  and 
social  workers),  or  of  those  who  used  them  (their  "clients"): My 
own research,  which dealt with public recreation, concluded that 
parks  and  playgrounds  ought  to  be planned  for  their  users,  and 
undoubtedly  left  an  a  priori  bias  in studying  the  larger  issue  in 
Levittown. 

13.  See,  e.g.,  Duncan and Schnore. 
14.  The builder was my only source of purchasers' names,  but he had 
a  policy of not giving  them  out to discourage  milk  salesmen  and 
other  merchants  from  bothering  people  before  they  moved  in. 
The  firm  also  had  little  interest  in  research,  and  some  officials 
feared  that  several  purchasers  might  change  their  minds  about 
buying if I interviewed them about  it. Consequently, I  had  to ask 
people  to  recall  the  aspirations  with  which  they  came,  but  they 
mentioned  the  same  ones  which  appeared  in  the  mail  question· 
naire  that was  filled  out before  arrival  in Levittown. 

15.  The questionnaire was  on  University  of Pennsylvania  stationery, 
and answered  ones  were  to  be  returned  to  the  campus,  thus  al-
leviating any  suspicion  that it was  a  Levitt  research  project.

its planners: who made the critical decisions for the conception of 
the community, with what  goals  in mind,  and  for  what  kinds  of 
residents and aspirations? The most important role was,  of course, 
played  by  the  builder,  Levitt  and  Sons.  The  firm  was  founded 
during the Depression by  the late Abraham Levitt, a  "self-made" 
son  of  Russian-Jewish  immigrants  who  had  practiced real  estate 
law  for  a  quarter  of  a  century  before  going  into  the  building 
business, and by  his two sons,  William and the late Alfred.  Until 
the beginning of World War II, the firm  built a number of small 
suburban  subdivisions  on  Long  Island,  priced  to  appeal  to  the 
upper  middle  class  then  streaming  to  the  Island.  After  World 
War II, as  a result of experience gained in building Navy housing, 
the  Levitts  developed  a  mass  production  scheme  that  allowed 
them  to  build  inexpensive  housing  for  the  postwar flood  of vet· 
erans and their families. 1 

Most of  the concepts that went into planning Levittown,  New 
Jersey,  were  evolved  in the two earlier Levittowns,  in New York 
and  Pennsylvania.  Levittown,  Long  Island,  begun  in  1947,  was 
built  in  traditional  subdivision  style,  with  the  builder  buying a 
piece  of  land-much  larger  than  most  others,  to  be  sure-and 
then acquiring further acreage as sales continued to go well.  The 
houses  in  Levittown were smaller versions  of the  expensive  sub-
urban ones the Levitt firm  had built previously,  but included an

array  of  home  appliances  and  were  located  around  Village 
Greens that consisted of neighborhood shops, a playgt=ound, and a 
swimming  pooJ.2  Perhaps  these  additional  items  were  provided 
because  of  the  builder's  uncertainty  that  the  house  alone  was 
salable.  Levittown was,  after all,  an experiment, begun when the 
housing industry as  a whole  had known  only lack of demand and 
when  fears  of a  postwar  depression  were  still  prevalent.  But  the 
firm  also  had  an  additional  goal:  to  create  a  community.  This 
emerged  more  clearly  when  Alfred  Levitt,  who  was  trained  in 
architecture,  proposed his scheme for  Landia, a  675-acre commu-
nity elsewhere  on Long  Island.3  It was  planned  to  provide sepa-
rate  residential  neighborhoods  without  through  streets,  a  town 
center,  and  a  complete  set  of  community  facilities,  including 
parks. 

Landia  was  never  built,  partly  because  of the  moratorium on 
housing at the start of the Korean War, but some of its ideas were 
incorporated  in  the  building of the  second  Levittown,  in Bucks 
County,  Pennsylvania,  in  1951.  Although  the  Levitt  firm  was 
secure enough by this time to  buy a much larger amount of land 
at  the  start,  the  community was  still  not  totally  planned  in  ad-
vance,  the  individual  neighborhoods  being laid  out  just  before 
their construction.  The plan for  this second  Levittown called for 
about 17,ooo homes, and neighborhoods free from through traffic, 
with elementary schools,  playgrounds,  and  pools  at  their  center. 
The local shopping centers were almost  entirely eliminated after 
the firm  learned to its dismay that a  large shopping center in the 
Long Island Levittown-not built by the firm-was drawing most 
of the  sales  away  from  shops  on the Village  Greens.  Instead,  the 
Levitts  built a  huge  "regional"  shopping center  on  the  edge  of 
their  new  Levittown,  hoping  to  attract  not  only  their  house 
buyers but people from other communities as  well. The firm also 
gave  land  to  a  number of churches,  institutionalizing a  practice 
that had begun on an ad hoc basis in the initial Levittown when 
a church came to the builder with a request for free land. 

But  Levittown,  Pennsylvania,  like  Levittown,  ~.Island, 
had  one  major  drawback.  Because  of  the  way  land  ~ been 
purchased,  the  final  community was  spread  out ovett  foUf  town· 
ships and many other governmental units, arid in deve19fliDS  the 
land the builder had to negotiate separately with each unit, This 
not  only  took  considerable  time  and  energy,  but  required 
changes  in  the  initial  plan,  particularly  in  the  design  of  neigh· 

The  Planners  of  Levittown 
borhoods and location  of schools,  and also forced  the firm  to ad-
minister recreation  areas so  as  to  limit their use  to  purchasers of 
Levitt  houses.  As  a  result,  the  firm's  executives  were  frequently 
diverted  from  the  business  of  building  and  even  became  em-
broiled in community conflicts.

Not  long after  the  Bucks  County development had  gotten  off 
to a  successful  start,  the firm  began to consider yet a  third Levit·· 
town,  and  this  time  it sought  to  eliminate  the  difficulties  it had 
encountered previously by purchasing land within a single town-
ship.  Ultimately,  the  choice  fell  on  Willingboro  township  in 
New  Jersey.  Willingboro  township  was  an  area  of  small  farms, 
producing  peaches,  plums,  and  tomatoes  on  the  region's  sandy 
soil. Just outside the ring of postwar surburbs that had sprung up 
around Philadelphia, and  only about  ten  miles  from  Levittown, 
Pennsylvania,  it  was  eminently  "ripe"  for  residential  develop-
ment.  It was  particularly suitable for  Levitt and Sons  because  it 
was  inhabited only  by  individual  farmers,  a  few  owners of  what 
had  once  been  a  summer  home  colony,  and  the  village  of  Ran-
cocas,  a  nineteenth  century  Quaker  settlement  of  less  than  soo 
people. Soon after the firm  bought  the land,  it had the  township 
boundaries changed  so  that  Rancocas was  incorporated  into  the 
neighboring  township  of  Westampton.  Thus  it  had  obtained  a 
large  acreage,  located  entirely within  one  township  and  occupy-
ing most  of  it.  Once  Rancocas had  been moved  out,  only  about 
6oo  people were left  in the township,  and  they,  the  builder  felt, 
could  be  persuaded  to  give  him  a  free  hand  to  build  as  he 
wished.  Willingboro  would  provide  a  virtual  tabula  rasa  for 
realizing William Levitt's goals and plans. 

THE PLANNING  PROCESS 

By the time  the planning for  Levittown,  New Jersey,  began, con-
trol  of  the  firm  was  entirely  in  the  hands  of  William  Levitt. 
Abraham Levitt had retired because of increasing age, and Alfred 
Levitt  had  left  the  firm,  selling  his  share  of  the  stock  to  his 
brother, reputedly because  they  could not develop  a  method for 
making decisions jointly. Working with William Levitt were half 
a  dozen  executives,  many of whom  had been with  the firm  since 
the late  1940s,  but the final  decisions were his. 4  Like his brother, 
he was  open  to  advice,  but  he  was  known  as  a  man  who  rarely 
changed  his  mind  once  he  had  made  it  up.6  William  Levitt's 

•  6  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

goals  were  to build another profitable development and a  better 
community,  more  comprehensively  planned  in  advance  and 
more completely stocked with public facilities.  He also sought to 
end  the attacks  by  planners, architects,  and social  critics against 
the  firm  and  the  past  Levittowns.  Known  for  his low  opinion of 
the city planning profession,  however, and lacking Alfred's inter-
est  in its  concepts and schemes,  he  had no intention  of  building 
the community to please the planners.  Nor was  he especially con-
cerned about how to satisfy the buyers and meet their aspirations. 
As  the most successful  home builder in  the  East,  with a decade's 
reputation for  providing "the best  house  for  the money,"  he felt 
he knew what they wanted.  Unlike his father, he had no desire to 
involve the firm  in the life of the community or to uplift the cul-
tural  level  and  civic  performance  of  the  residents.  He  wanted 
only to  build what he deemed to  be a  better Levittown, what he 
often called a "showplace." 

Because of the success  of the Bucks County community, Levitt 
felt  secure  enough to buy So  per cent of the land he would need 
for  the  entire  community,  with  options  on  the  remaining  por-
tion.  A  fairly  complete plan of  the  eventual community was  de-
veloped,  including  an  overall  road  system,  a  community-wide 
sewage  and  water  supply  system  to  be  built  before  the  commu-
nity  was  occupied,  and  a  generalized  scheme  for  shopping,  in-
cluding  both  a  regional  retail  center and  a  series of local  ones, 
and  for  locating  schools  and  churches.  The  plan  was  gen-
eralized  in  that preliminary locations for  these  facilities were  in-
cluded in the site maps with which  the firm  worked, but final  lo-
cations and facility designs were not made until just before actual 
construction.  No  longer  needing  to  accommodate  his  ideas  to 
several  township boundaries,  the builder could plan  the commu-
nity as  a set of residential  "parks," with school,  playground, and 
pool  located  at  the  center in  true  neighborhood  planning tradi-
tion. 

There were other innovations  in the plan for  the  third  Levit· 
town. The elementary schools would be provided by the firm and 
their  cost  incorporated  into  the  house  price.  They  could  be 
"donated"  to  the  community,  thus  keeping  taxes  down,  and 
would  be  open when  people  moved  in.  The previous  pattern of 
neighborhoods with only one house type was dropped. From now 
on,  the  three  types  of houses  were  to be mixed on  each street:  a 
four-bedroom  "Cape  Cod"  initially  selling for  $u.soo;  a  three-

The  Planners  of  Levittown 

•  7  • 

bedroom,  one-story  "Rancher"  for  $13,ooo;  and  a  two-story 
"Colonial,"  one  with  three,  another  with  four  bedrooms  and 
costing  $14,000  and  $14,500  respectively.  Each  house  type  was 
built  in  two  elevations,  but  with  the  same  floor  plan,  and  was 
varied  in  external  color  to  effect  yet  more  visual  heterogeneity. 
Whereas the houses  in Levittown,  Pennsylvania, were of a  fairly 
severe modern style,  those in New Jersey would be in the pseudo-
Colonial  style  popular all  over  the  Eastern  seaboard.  The shop-
ping center, again located at the edge  of the community, was de-
signed  by  a  nationally  known  architect  who  had  built  a  prize-
winning  center  in  the  Middle  West,  providing  a  considerably 
more  attractive  shopping  area  than  in  the  Pennsylvania  Levit-
town. 

During  the  initial  planning  phase,  Levitt  employed  an  engi-
neer  with  city  planning experience  to  develop  the  overall  plan, 
and also brought in a number of nationally known consultants to 
design  detailed  plans  for  educational  and  recreational  facilities; 
but no city  planners were  included among  the  consultants.  Sub-
sequently,  he  did  work  with  the  planner  hired  by  Willingboro 
township, and in  1964, when the firm was  building developments 
of  varying  size  in  a  number  of  locations  all  over  the  world,  it 
finally  hired a  city planner to help select sites and make prelim-
inary master plans. 

The  executives  themselves  were  divided  into  two  relatively 
stable  factions,  the  self-styled  "idealists"  who  wanted  to  build 
what  they  considered  the  best  possible  community,  and  the 
"realists,"  concentrated  mainly  in  the  comptroller's  office,  who 
were concerned with economy and sometimes questioned innova-
tions that might increase costs or affect sales.  Levitt himself seems 
to have mediated between the two groups. In the initial phases of 
planning  he  sided  with  the  idealists,  but later,  when  plans  were 
about to  be implemented, he became more conscious of cost and 
market considerations and often supported the re.,Uists.  Generally 
speaking,  the  plans  put  forth  by  the  idealists  and  their  consul-
tants were accepted when they contributed to the development of 
the  best  community  at  the  lowest  cost,  and  rejected  when  they 
were  too  expensive  or  added  "frills"  that  would  not  help  sales. 
Although  Levitt  had  been  traditionally  hostile  to  outsiders,  he 
accepted  many of the consultants'  proposals--often  because  they 
agreed  with  his  own  ideas.  The  consultants  had  been  chosen 
initially because of their national reputations, and the agreement 

•  8  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

between  them and  Levitt was  often fortuitous.  For example,  the 
concept  of  the  school  at  the  center  of  the  neighborhood,  origi-
nally  brought  into  the  firm  by  Alfred  Levitt,  was  also  part  of 
traditional  planning ideology and was  favored  by the school con-
sultants as well.  Similarly, because the firm wanted to divest itself 
of control of the recreation  facilities and believed that the school 
and  playground  would  be  used  by  the  same  people  and  should 
therefore be administered jointly. it proposed a combined school-
playground-pool area.  When  the firm  asked the National  Recrea-
tion Association  for  technical  help,  it did not know  that  that or-
ganization  had  advocated  such  a  combination  for  almost  forty 
years. 

But some plans were rejected.  One Levitt official wanted a new 
and comprehensively planned educational  system  to  be designed 
under  the  aegis  of  the  Ford  Foundation,  but  when  Foundation 
funds  for  this  scheme  were  not  available,  a  more  conventional 
school  system,  more akin to  existing county and  township values 
and  practices,  was  developed  instead.  The  ambitious  recreation 
plan  of  another  firm  member,  providing  for  a  large  park  and 
playground  system  around  the  school  and  more  than  one swim-
ming  pool  for  each  neighborhood,  was  similarly  cut  down  to 
make  more  land  available  for  houses.  As  the  time  for  bu-ilding 
drew  closer,  both of  these  officials  who stood for  a  maximum in-
vestment  in  community  facilities  could  not  agree  with  the  em-
phasis  on  housing,  and eventually  they  were  fired,  although  not 
for this reason alone. 

Perhaps  the  principal  innovation  in  the  new  Levittown  was 
the mixing of house types. This idea, originally suggested by Mrs. 
Levitt,  debated  within  the  firm  for  several  months,  and  finally 
carried out by Levitt over  the strong objections of all  his execu-
tives,  stemmed indirectly from  the criticisms of the city planners, 
particularly  Lewis  Mumford.  During the  1950s,  when attacks on 
the  physical  and  demographic  homogeneity  of  the  postwar  sub-
urban  subdivisions  began,  Levittown  was  frequently  mentioned 
as  the prototype.  At first,  the  firm  shrugged off  this criticism.  As 
it continued to mount, however, and spread into the mass media, 
Levitt  became  concerned  that  Levittown's  image  would  be  im-
paired and  even  that sales  might  be  affected,  particularly  when, 
later  in  the  decade,  the  sellers'  market was  starting  to  become a 
buyers'  market.  By  the time he was  ready to start the third Levit-

The  Planners  of  Levittown

town,  Levitt also  wanted a  reputation  for  building the best  pos-
sible communities. 

In  addition,  the  firm  was  beginning  to  upgrade  the  image  of 
the purchaser it was  seeking.  In Long Island  it had built for  vet-
erans and had attracted predominantly lower middle class buyers. 
In Pennsylvania, however, Levittown also drew a number of blue 
collar  workers  and  what  Levitt  officials  worriedly  called  "mar-
ginal"  buyers,  people  who  could not  really  afford  the  house. but 
were able to take it because no down  payment had been required 
under Veterans  Administration  mortgage  insurance  regulations. 
The  firm  did  not  want  marginal  buyers  in the  new  Levittown, 
and,  in  fact,  hoped  to  build  somewhat  more  expensive  houses 
which  would  increase  its  profit  margin.  If it  was  to  do  so,  and 
bring  in  middle  and  upper  middle  class  home  buyers,  Levitt 
wanted  to  prove  incorrect  the  critical  magazine  articles  on  sub-
urbia  read  by  this  population.  When  the  idea  of  mixed  house 
types  was  approved,  one  of  the  Levitt  executives  pointed  out, 
"Now  Lewis  Mumford  can't  criticize  us  any  more";  later,  the 
firm  promoted  the  innovation  as  a  sales  device.  In  the  press  re-
lease announcing the ope.ning of the new Levittown,  Levitt said, 
"We  are  ending  once  and  for  all  the  old  bugaboo  of  uniform-
ity . . . .  In  the  new  Levittown,  we  build  all  the  different 
houses  . . .  right  next  to  each  other  within  the  same  section." 
The  struggle  against  criticism  affected  other  features  of  the 
plan.  Although  the  Levitts  personally  identified  so  much  with 
their  developments  as  to  give  them  the  family  name,  William 
Levitt was  quite aware that some people considered "Levittown" 
a  symbol  of  the  worst  in  suburban  development,  even  if others 
saw itas a  brand name for good and inexpensive houses. 6  Several 
executives  urged  strongly  that  the  name  be dropped,  but  Levitt 
rejected  the  idea.  As  a  compromise,  the  merchandising  was  to 
stress  the  individual  parks  into  which  people  would  buy.  A 
Levitt  official  pointed  out,  "One  of  the  major  reasons  for  the 
neighborhood  plan  was  to  answer  the  critics  of  Levittown  who 
say  that it is one huge mass of homogeneous mass-produced hous-
ing,  all  preplanned  to  standardization  and  mass  production." 
Shortly  before  Levittown,  New Jersey,  opened  for  occupancy, 
an  article  by  William  Levitt  entitled  "What!  Live  in  a  Levit-
town?"  appeared  in  Good  Housekeeping. 7  In  it,  the  builder 
argued-and  quite  rightly  scr-that  mass-produced  housing  did 

•  10  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

not  lead  to  conformity  or  homogeneity  among  the  population. 
After  Levittown  opened,  many  tongue-in-cheek  advertisements 
appeared in the Philadelphia papers which sought to give the im-
pression  that Levittowners were diverse, respectably middle class, 
but not overly sophisticated. One ad,  headed "Wanted:  Zoologist 
for a  Neighbor,"  indicated  that all  occupations were represented 
in  Levittown  but  listed  mostly  professional  ones.  Another,  en-
titled "Hi and  Middle Fi," suggested  that the Levitt house could 
be rigged  up for hi-fi  enthusiasts,  but poked fun at such sophisti-
cated  taste  and  concluded,  "You'll  find  all  kinds of music  lovers 
in Levittown, but we've discovered that most of them are middle-
fi,  like ourselves."  8 

When  it came  to  planning the houses,  however,  there was  len 
concern with status than with livability and effective use of space. 
The houses  built in the third Levittown were radically improved 
versions  of  the  models  built  in  the  earlier  ones,  altered  fre-
quently  and  sometimes  annually  in  a  process  of  trial  and  error 
that responded  partly to market reactions,  partly to technological 
innovation and cost-cutting opportunities, and  partly to a  desire 
for  change  within  the  Levitt  firm.  The  basic  construction  con-
cepts  and  layouts  have  remained  remarkably  stable,  however. 
The Levitt house is built on a concrete slab with precut materials 
and  is  put  together  on  an assembly  line  basis.9  The layout  pro-
vides  a  relatively  open  house  plan,  with  maximum  space  for 
rooms  and  for  storage,  and  a  minimum  for  circulation  or  sym-
bolic, non utilitarian space such as a foyer. 

In the initial  planning phase, Levitt considered a  total revision 
of the basic house types, and asked  two world-famous architects to 
submit sketch  plans.  \Vhen  their houses  turned out to cost about 
$5o,ooo,  they had  to  be dropped, and the firm's  own small  archi-
tectural  department,  with  assistance  from  Levitt  executives,  was 
given  the  job  of  revamping  the  designs  used  in  Levittown, 
Pennsylvania.  When  models  of  the  houses  were  erected,  Levitt 
himself looked them over and suggested changes. After the model 
was  opened  to  the  public,  criticisms  and suggestions  for  it were 
recorded  at  the  sales  desk.  If a  model  did  not  sell,  it  was  rede-
signed  at  once.  Usually  the  models  were  not  altered  until  the 
annual  model  change  or until  sales  dropped to a  point where al-
teration was considered necessary. 10 

The  improvements  made  in  the  houses  over  time  have  in-
creased  their  spaciousness  and  efficiency,  with  little  concern  for 

The  Planners  of  Levittown 

•  11  • 

fashion  except  in  inexpensive  externals.  Despite  the  popularity 
of  basement  or  split-level  designs,  the  finn  refused  to  consider 
them  until  1965,  when  it  built some  basement  houses  in  a  new 
Long  Island  project.  Likewise,  Levitt  officials  chose  the  pseudo-
Colonial design for New Jersey, not because of its popularity, but 
because  they  felt  it would  help  them  attract  higher-income  pur-
chasers,  and because  they themselves disliked  the starkly modern 
designs  they had  initiall.Y  built in  Levittown,  Pennsylvania.  The 
design  of  the  Levittown  houses  proceeded,  then,  on  an  ad  hoc 
basis,  with  periodic  improvements  based  on  what  the  firm 
thought best and with recognition of  the vetoes expressed  in the 
market.  Beyond  this  point,  there  was  no  catering  to  the  cus-
tomers. 

For  this  reason,  no market research  of any kind went into  the 
planning  of  Levittown,  New  Jersey,  although  just  before  the 
community  opened  some  of  the  less  optimistic  Levitt  officials 
commissioned  a  prominent  land  economist  to  estimate  the 
market for the community.  His report was  extremely pessimistic, 
noting  that  the  metropolitan area market for  low-priced,  single-
family housing was almost saturated, and that the new  Levittown 
was  located  outside  of  what  were  then  considered  the  bound-
aries  of  Philadelphia's suburban  commuting zone.  As  it  turned 
out,  the consultant's prediction was  accurate, for  by  1960 the soft 
market  conditions  he  had  forecast  began  to  appear,  forcing  a 
slowdown  in  the construction schedule  that  has  continued  until 
the  present.  Although  the  finn  expected  to  build  12,000  houses 
by  1965,  it had only put up about 6ooo  by  that date-and it had 
also established a market research department. 

In  planning  for  the  new  Levittown,  however,  Levitt  had  no 
inkling of what was  to come. His mass  production techniques had 
previously  enabled  the  firm  to  undersell  its  competitors  in  the 
area,  and  in a  seller's  market  it did not  need  to  think about  the 
buyers.  The  Levitt  officials'  ability  to  make  decisions  without 
consulting them  was  aided considerably by  their consensus  with 
and  similarity  to  their  customers.  Most  of  the  Levitt  executives 
were born and raised  in the suburbs, and had little or no use  for 
the  city,  other  than  as  a  place  for  occasional  recreational  and 
shopping  trips.  They  favored  single-family  housing  and  could 
not  understand  why  anyone  would  want  to  live  either  in  apart-
ments  or  in  the  row  houses  that  had  been  Philadelphia's  domi-
nant  building  type.  They  believed  that  the  utility  of  the  house 

•  12  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

for  family  living  carne  first  and  that  style  was  secondary.  Their 
taste  was  not  much  different  from  that  of  their customers;  both 
rejected  the  abstract  and severe  contemporary design  that domi-
nated the architectural magazines of the late 1950s. 

If anything,  the  firm's  official  style  was  a  more  exuberant ver-
sion  of  its  customers',  in  much  the  same  way  as  movie  stars  are 
often  exaggerated  versions  of  what  their  fans  would  like  to  be. 
Indeed,  a  decade  earlier,  Eric  Larrabee  had  described  the  first 
Levitt  office  building  as  "Selznick  Colonial." 11  The  new  head-
quarters building the firm  put up in Levittown,  New Jersey, was 
furnished in what one might call  Dionysian-Modem, a vivid and 
often  garish  mixture  of  bright  colors,  strong  textures,  and  an-
tique  as  well  as  modem  knickknacks.  Levitt's  office  had  whiJ_e 
rugs  and  gold-plated  bathroom  fixtures,  and  the  model  homes, 
furnished  to  entice  purchasers,  displayed a  similar,  if less  expen-
sive, Dionysian motif. 

About  their  purchasers'  aspirations  for  life  in  Levittown,  the 
Levitt officials  thought  only rarely.  Some  looked  down  on  them 
as  being  of a  lesser  status,  but others  saw  them as  smart,  young, 
socially  mobile  couples  who  really  wanted  to  live  in  high-status 
suburbs  but  could  not  afford  to  do  so.  Mostly,  the  firm  viewed 
them as  people who needed a new house and were obviously sen-
sible  in  their  choice  of  Levittown,  because  they  realized  that 
Levitt's houses were the best value for the money.  It also felt that 
most  of  their  buyers  were  moving  to  Levittown  only  because  of 
the  house  and  had  little  interest  in  the  wider  community.  As  a 
result,  whenever  Levittowners  objected  to  conditions  in  the 
community, firm  officials were  quick  to argue-whether the firm 
was responsible or not-that the objections were those of a minor-
ity,  "self-seeking  politicians,"  or  "sick"  people  who just wanted 
to  show  off  for  psychological  reasons.  Suspicion  of  community 
participation  was  a  tradition  of  the  Levitt  organization,  even 
though  there  had  been  much  less  builder-buyer  conflict  in  the 
Levittowns  than  in  most  other  new  housing  developments. 12 

Marketing  the  House 

The only deliberate  planning vis·a-vis the eventual  purchasers 
took place in marketing the house.  That process was  aimed at at: 
tracting the young family  buying its first  home, a group to which 
the  builder  had  appealed  ever  since  he  began  to  build  the  first 
Levittown.  The  houses  were  designed  with  young  children  in

mind, with bedrooms just large  enough  to  serve  as  playrooms as 
well,  an  extra  bathroom  for  them,  and  the  kitchen  located  so 
mothers  could  watch  their  children  play  outside.18  In  addition, 
Levitt provided all  the necessary kitchen  appliances,  eliminating 
extra  initial  expenditures.  He  absorbed  settlement  costs,  which 
often come  to  5 per cent or more of the house price, and he sim-
plified  the sales  procedure so  that  buying a  house  was  almost as 
easy  as  buying  a  washing  machine.  His advertising  stressed  that 
there were "no hidden  extras,  and  the  price you  pay  is  the price 
we  say."  Unlike builders of higher-priced  houses,  he emphasized 
the size  of  the down  payment-which  thanks  to  FHA  insurance 
was  low-and  the  monthly  payments,  so  that  prospective  pur-
chasers  could  readily  figure  exactly  how  much  the  house  would 
take out of the paycheck. 

The  firm  went  to  a  considerable  effort  to  keep  the  monthly 
payment  figure  as  low  as  possible.  As  already  noted,  the  builder 
"donated"  the  schools  to  the  community.  During the  first  years, 
he  subsidized  the  schools'  operating costs  as  weii,  holding  taxes, 
which were added to  the monthly payment, at a  level  that would 
not  frighten  away  tite  family  earning  $6ooo  or  $7ooo  a  year. 
Thanks to  the scale on which the firm  was  operating,  the cost of 
schools,  utilities,  and  road  system  could  be  added  tQ  the  house 
price  without raising  it  beyond  what  other  builders  in  the  area 
were charging. 

While ail  the ads  mentioned  the  schools,  churches,  and  pools, 
the  major  emphasis  was  on  the size  and value of the  house,  pre-
sented in a confident yet catchy style as  if to dare skeptics to come 
to  see  whether  Levittown's  values  were  real.  Many  ads  were 
written  by  William  Levitt  himself.  When  the  prospective  pur-
chaser  came  out  to  the  model  homes  area,  his  attention  was 
focused  on  the  house,  and  the  sales  process  itself  was  muted  as 
much  as  possible.  The  salesmen  were  carefuily  selected  and 
trained  to  contradict  the  image  of  the  fast-buck,  easy-talking 
salesmen  traditionaiiy  associated  with  real  estate.  "Courteous 
representatives  are  on  hand  to  answer  your  questions,"  the  ads 
read. They were dressed in conservative dark clothes--to look like 
bankers, as  one Levitt official put it-and they were instructed by 
a  professional  speech  teacher  to  talk  in  a  sedate  but  friendly 
manner. 

'Vhile everyone was welcome to buy in Levittown, the firm did 
try  to  screen  out  two  types  of  people:  the  marginal  buyers  and 

•  14  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

the socially undesirable or emotionally disturbed.  Partly because 
of  FHA  regulations,  the  firm  had  set  an  income  floor  for  pur-
chasers:  people who wanted to buy had  to  have a  weekly  income 
10 per cent above the monthly carrying charge-more if they had 
many children or large outstanding debts.  Those  who  could  not 
meet  this  figure  were  asked  for  a  larger  down  payment or  were 
advised  against  putting  down  the  deposit,  and  some  were  ex-
cluded by the subsequent credit check. The salesmen were not to 
sell  to disreputable or especially  unkempt  people,  and  the credit 
check  excluded  people  with  a  record  of  job  instability  or  legal 
difficulties. 14  The  "social  filtering"  process  was,  however,  less 
effective  than  the  income  check,  for  some  people with  serious--
but not visible-problems were able to buy into the community. 
Until  the state enforced a  nondiscrimination  law,  salesmen  re-
fused  to  sell  to  Negroes  and  assured  whites  who  asked  abouT 
Negroes  that  the community would  be as  lily-white  as  the other 
Levittowns.  After  the  law  was  enforced,  the  salesmen  protected 
themselves by citing the .law,  and  promised  to  locate people who 
did  not  like  to  be  near  Negroes  away  from  them,  but  also  dis-
couraged  those  who  were  strongly  biased  against  Negroes  from 
buying  in  Levittown.  (The  story  of  Levittown's  integration  is 
told in Chapter Fourteen.) 

LEVITT  AND  WILLINGBORO  TOWNSillP 

The  Levitt  planning  did  not  take  place  within  a  vacuum,  of 
course.  Perhaps  the  most  important  outside  influences  were  the 
federal  government,  which  thwugh FHA insured  the  mortgages 
of  the  purchasers, and  the  banks  who  purchased  them.  Without 
the  FHA,  Levittown  could  not  have  been  built,  for  the  banks 
would  not  take  the  uninsured  mortgages  of  middle-income, 
young home buyers whose long-term financial status was,  at best, 
unpredictable. Levitt had to meet the FHA regulations,  both for 
the design of the house and the community, and the expectations 
of the bankers and savings and loan association officials,  but since 
the previous Levittowns had met FHA standards,  this created no 
problem.  Indeed,  thanks  to  his  previous success,  Levitt was  able 
to quiet the fears of his bankers that the mixing of house types on 
the street would inhibit sales. 

The  other  group  which  played  a  role-even  if  not  a  major 
one-in the early planning of Levittown was the government and 

The  Planners  of  Levittown 

•  15  • 

the old residents of Willingboro township. Willingboro township 
was  a  sleepy  farming  area  with  a  history-albeit  uneventful-
dating back to William Penn's arrival in the Philadelphia area in 
1681. Its political and civic life was in the hands of a  few  families 
some of whom had been in power for at least  125 years.  Although 
one  or  two  were  wealthy,  most  of  them  were  friendly  and easy-
going  lower  middle  class  people,  who explained guilelessly  that 
they were running township affairs because no one else was  inter-
ested and someone had  to do  it.  Yet newcomers  to  the township, 
and  especially  those  with  dissident  views,  were  often  denied 
access to the political and social elite. 

In  1952,  the township had set up a  Planning Board, mainly be-
cause,  in  the words  of its founder,  "We just went along with the 
crowd;  everybody  was  doing  it."  Also,  it  was  feared  that  even· 
tually  subdividers  would  come  to  the  area,  and  the  township 
ought to  protect itself.  A  zoning ordinance was  passed,  designat-
ing  the  land  as  agricultural,  but  nothing  else  was  done  until 
1955,  when  it became  known  that  land  was  being purchased  by 
unknown  buyers.  At  that  time,  the  chairman  of  the  Planning 
Board decided to hire a planning consultant. 

The planning consultant was  a  professional  who  had  been ac· 
tive in other parts of Burlington County for several years and saw 
his  role as  one of educating this predominantly rural area to the 
virtues  of  master  planning.  His  ideas  reflected  those  traditional 
among planners:  orderly and effective  use of the land to  prevent 
patches of vacant land amidst other development that would lead 
to  urban  sprawl,  and an  esthetically  pleasing  landscape.  He was 
particularly concerned with the elimination of "strip shopping," 
believing stores strung out on i:najor streets and highways  to be a 
"commercial  cancer  growth,"  which  might  blight  residential 
neighborhoods near them. A  crusader on this  topic,  he was  espe-
cially  intent  on  keeping  out  essential  but  unsightly  enterprises 
such  as  ice  cream  parlors,  hot  dog  stands,  and  commercial 
garages. 

Once  hired by  the  township,  the planner persuaded  it  to have 
him draw up a  master  plan which  he  hoped the Levitt organiza-
tion  would  also  follow.  Initially,  Levitt  was  hostile;  he  wanted 
total  control  and  was  fearful  of  any  outside  interference,  espe-
cially  by  a  city  planner.  Consequently,  he  urged  the  Planning 
Board to fire  the planner, but was  persuaded that this was an in· 
auspicious  beginning  for  Levitt's  relationship with  Willingboro

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

township.  Since the firm  was sensitive to criticism about the lack 
of  planning  in  earlier  Levittowns,  the  planner  was  eventually 
able  to  persuade  the  Levitt  organization  that  a  master  plan 
would be  to  its  benefit.  On the other hand,  the  planner realized 
that  his  master  plan  would  be  largely  dependent  on  Levitt's 
building program.  He soon concluded that the cause of planning 
and  his  own  efforts  could  best  be  advanced  by  siding  with  the 
builder,  whom  he  considered  an  agent  of  progress,  rather  than 
with  the  existing  residents,  some  of  whom  would  probably  be 
opposed to the new community. 

The township Planning Board knew little about city planning, 
but  its  members  were  sincere  and  earnest  enough  to  feel  that 
planning,  whatever  it  might  be,  was  a  good  thing.  The  con-
sultant's first  recommendation was  a  revision  of the zoning ordi-
nance which would enable it--or the consultant-to prevent strip 
shopping  on  the  major  highway  on  which  Levittown  fronts. 
Naturally,  the people who owned this  land objected strenuously. 
This  zoning  ordinance  crystallized  the  township  into  pro- and 
anti-Levitt  factions.  Generally  speaking,  the  people  whose  land 
Levitt  had  bought-mostly  the  bigger  landowners,  since  he  was 
interested only in large acreage-were, if not in favor of Levitt, at 
least amenable.  Conversely,  those  who  had not been approached 
by Levitt-people who owned only two or three acres--or did not 
want to sell  to Levitt made up the anti-Levitt faction.  From  this 
time  on  until  the  arrival  of  the  new  Levittowners,  the  once 
peaceful  politics  of  the  township  were  no  more;  old friendships 
and  alliances  disintegrated  as  some  sided  with,  others  against 
Levitt. 

The  hateful  zoning  ordinance  was  rescinded  after  the  people 
on  the  highway  started  court  proceedings.  This,  as  well  as  the 
general antagonism to  Levitt by some of the community leaders, 
helped  to  bring the  planning consultant  firmly  on  Levitt's  side. 
He decided that the old residents were interested only in making 
as  much  money  as  they  could  from  Levitt's  presence  and  that 
they had no interest in good planning.  From then on, the consul-
tant worked so  closely  with  the builder that  it caused  him some 
difficulty  in obtaining the community's  trust.  Because  of this re-
lationship, the planner knew the firm's still confidential building 
plans  and  was  therefore  reluctant  to  talk  to  citizens,  which  also 
affected his relationship to  the community. Indeed, when I  asked 
him  for  an  interview  to  learn  about  the  master  plan,  I  was  re-

The  Planners  of  Levittown 

•  17  • 

fused,  only  to  receive  a  call  from  a  Levitt  vice-president  who 
asked  why  I  wanted  the  interview.  Once  I  had  explained  my 
study to him, I  had no trouble in obtaining an interview with the 
planning consultant. 

Levitt had never favored  the ordinance against strip shopping 
as  much as  the planner, and once it had been rescinded,  the firm 
had little difficulty in persuading the township fathers to approve 
his  building  plans.  There  were  several  reasons  for  this.  First, 
some of the people in the pro-Levitt faction planned to remain in 
Willingboro  township  even  after  Levittown  had  been  built and 
believed that the interests of their community could best be served 
by letting Levitt go ahead with  his develvpment without  undue 
harassment.  They  wanted  to  live  in  a  good-looking  and  well-
planned  township,  and  had  been  persuaded  that  the  anti-Levitt 
faction  would  sell  its  land  to  speculators  who  would  put up hot 
dog  stands,  small  factories,  and  the  other  low-status  outlets 
against  which  the  planning  consultant  had  been  campaigning. 
Some  had  more  immediate  motives;  they  hoped  to  work  in  the 
township,  either  in  the  government  or  in  stores  which  they 
would open to serve the new residents. 

Also,  the  firm's  intention  to  build-and  pay  for-most  of  the 
municipal  facilities  relieved  public officials  of the need  to worry 
about  them.  Unlike  small  subdividers  elsewhere  in  the  county, 
Levitt was  providing the schools,  roads,  water and sewage  plants, 
and other facilities, and because he was doing so--and because the 
new Levittowners would be paying for  them-the older residents 
of the  township felt  he ought to  have  the right to determine  the 
character  of  those  facilities.  They  all  realized  that  whatever  he 
provided  would  be far  superior  to  what had  existed  before,  and 
possibly even better than what would be built with public funds. 
As  a  rural area,  Willingboro  township-and  Burlington County 
-had not been noted for lavishness in the provision of public fa-
cilities in the past. 

The  public  officials  who  had  to  approve  the  Levitt  building 
plans could,  of  course~ have  asked  for  better or more  expensive 
facilities.  In some  instances,  however,  they had no legal  basis for 
such requests, since the township and county both lacked modern 
building and  other codes.  Yet  even when  they had effective  veto 
power over Levitt's operations,  they did not often  think to exer-
cise  it,  because  they  felt  Levitt was  trying  to do a  good  job and 
would  make  the  township  the  best  in  the  county.  Cooperation 

•  18  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

with  the builder  would  be  far  more  pleasant  than conflict,  they 
concluded,  particularly  since  they  had  little  chance  of  winning 
such conflict. 

Most of the old residents were farmers,  without the knowledge 
and skills to stand up against the builder.  For example, the ablest 
member of the Planning Board thought that the township would 
look better if Levitt were required to build on 75-foot lots rather 
than on the 6o-foot lots he wanted to allow for in  the subdivision 
ordinance.  He could not, however,  make his argument stick,  and 
after Levitt had promised that he would never build on less  than 
65-foot lots, he gave in. 

The Levitt firm  itself was not passive in the face of opposition. 
Its  officials  had  had  two  decades  of  experience  in  dealing  with 
local opposition, and they had a reputation for brilliant tactics as 
well  as  the  application  of campaign  funds  in  the  right  place  at 
the right  time.  When  Levitt  first  arrived  on  the  scene,  the  firm 
engaged some  prominent county figures  to  buy land,  and before 
the  planning was  over,  it  had 'hired,  for  one  reason  or another, 
most of the politically influential lawyers in the county and many 
who had influence in  the state capitol  as  well,  principally for  the 
alteration  of  township  boundaries.  Although  the  firm  never  in-
terfered officially  in county or township politics, and usually sent 
campaign  contributions  to  both  parties,  it  gave  more  to  defeat 
candidates it thought could cause trouble for the firm.  Every new 
community is  flooded with rumors that some local officials are on 
the  builder's  payroll,  and  Levittown  was  no  exception,  but one 
Levitt executive indicated that the  township leaders were so will-
ing to go along with the firm's wishes  that such distasteful  tactics 
were not necessary. 

Even  if  local  politicians  had  wanted  to  fight  Levitt,  they  had 
little  political  incentive.  Their  remaining  old  constituents  did 
not really  care  about· matters  that concerned  only  the  new com-
munity,  and  the  new  constituents  were  not  yet  on  the  scene. 
Even if  the politicians could agree among themselves to put up a 
united front against  Levitt  (which  was  not often  the case),  there 
was  always  the  possibility  that  he would  intervene against  them 
at  higher  political  levels  in  the  county and  state.  But when  the 
township officials did question the Levitt proposals,  it was almost 
always  on matters of detail.  On the larger  issues  they agreed,  for 
they  shared  some  basic  values  with  the  firm,  and  they  united 
against  a  common  enemy.  Both  were  antiurban,  and  both  re-

The  Planners  of  Levittown 

•  19  • 

sented  the  cosmopolitan,  upper  middle  class,  intellectual  values 
they associated  with  the  big city,  believing that planning should 
uphold the local values of the small  middle or lower middle class 
community. 13  This consensus  was  demonstrated  in  the  planning 
of the new school system. 

The  Ford  Foundation,  which  had  suggested  a  comprehensive 
planning program for  the Levittown  schools,  had urged  that the 
superintendent of an upper middle class  New  England suburban 
school  system  of national  repute  be hired  to  head  it,  to plan an 
educational  program  whose  graduates  would  presumably  head 
toward  the  most  cosmopolitan  of  the  country's  colleges.  When 
funds  for  this  plan  were  not forthcoming,  Levitt turned  the job 
of designing the schools  over to a  national  firm  of school  consul-
tants, and asked  the county Superintendent of Schools  to develop 
the  curriculum  and  hire  the  staff.  Both  the  consultants and  the 
superintendent defended more  traditional  local  approaches.  The 
consultants disliked  big-city schools and were conservative about 
educational innovation. "If you are going to try something new," 
the  principal  consultant  pointed  out,  "you  need  someone  to 
bounce  your  ideas  against,"  but  the  new  Levittowners  had  not 
yet arrived and  the township Board of Education was  hesitant to 
speak  for  them.  As a  result,  the  final  architectural  program  was 
the  consultants'  standard  package.  The  county  superintendent 
had spent most of his  professional  life in Burlington County, was 
personally  interested  in  rural  education,  and  did  not  favor 
teachers  from  the  big  cities  or  from  high-status  suburbs  who 
might  question  the  township's  rural,  lower  middle  class  values. 
I  do  not  know  how  the  Levitt  organization  felt  about  the 
Foundation's  cosmopolitan  educational  concepts,  but  it  had  no 
educational  aims  of  its  own,  and judging by  its  feelings  toward 
the  intellectuals  then  criticizing  suburbia,  it  was  not  distressed 
over the change in plans.  In any case,  the firm supported the con-
sultants  and  the  superintendent  fully,  allowing  the  township 
Board  of  Education  to  feel  that  its  essentially  rural  educational 
values  would  be  perpetuated  in  the  new  Levittown.  Subse-
quently,  the  county superintendent was  hired  to  run  the  Levit-
town  schools,  and  in  the  years  to  come,  when  the conflict  about 
upper middle class cosmopolitan and lower middle class local  ed-
ucation  raged  among  the  Levittowners  themselves,  the  builder 
was usually found on the side of the latter. 

As  it turned out, then, the goals of the Levitt organization and 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

the  township  were  never far  apart,  and  even  if  Levitt  sought  to 
accommodate  some  of  the criticism  of suburbia  in  his  planning, 
he was not  ready  to  build  the  kind of 'urbane  new  town  that  in-
tellectuals would approve.  Both in  their business judgments and 
in  their  personal  inclinations,  the  Levitt  officials  sided with  the 
young, middle class purchasers with whom they had been dealing 
successfully  in  the  past and  who,  they were sure,  would  approve 
the  innovations  they  had  made  in  their  aim  to  create  a  show-
place-but a  profitable one-in the newest  Levittown.

-·~-

IN  1958,  BEFORE  LEVITTOWN,  NEW  JERSEY,  WAS  OCCUPIED,  THE 
township  contained about 300  households.  By  tg6o,  the  number 
had risen  to  2978  (totaling  II,861  individuals). and  by  1964,  to 
about  6200  households  (with  about  25,000  individuals).  The 
people  to  be described  in this chapter are  the fint  !JOOO  families 
who  came  to  Levittown  between  October  1958  and  June  1960.1 
These  Levittowners  were,  like  many  other  suburbanites,  pri-
marily young families  who came  to  the  new community  to raise 
their  children.2  At  the  time  of  their  arrival  in  1958-1960,  al-
most  four  fifths  of  the  men  were  under forty;  44  per  cent  were 
between  the  ages  of  thirty  and  forty. 8  Ten  per cent  were  as  yet 
childless  couples;  another  6  per  cent,  in  which  the  wives  were 
over  thirty-five,  were  probably  permanently  childless.  Median 
family  size,  according  to  the  1960  Census,  was  !t·90· but  at  the 
time of arrival.  in  1958-t96o, almost  a  fifth  of the  families  had 
three  children,  and  another  1 1  per  cent  had  four  or  more.  A 
third  of  the  families  had  only children  of  preschool  age;  5  per 
cent had a majority of the children in high school. 

At time of arrival, the median family  income of the population 
was  $7125;  11  per cent earned  more  than  $10,500  and about  20 
per cent earned  less  than  the $5500  required  for  buyers  making 
the minimal down payment. 4  Eighteen per cent of the men were 
professionals,  56  per cent were white coiiar workers,  and  16  per 
cent  w~re blue collar workers.  Among  the white coiiar workers, 

The  Levittowners-and  Why  They  Came 

13  per cent were managers and mihor officials;  18  per  cent were 
technicians and semiprofessionals; and the remaining 25  per cent 
were  in  clerical  and  sales  work.  The  blue  collar  workers  were 
divided into 7 per cent foremen,  10 per cent skilled workers,  and 
9  per cent semiskilled and unskilled  workers.  Most  of the  Levit-
towners  worked  in  the  offices,  stores,  and  electronics  and  other 
manufacturing and research  plants in Philadelphia and Camden, 
but  12  per cent were in the armed forces,  principally as  Air Force 
pilots.  Being mainly young people,  their educational  levels  were 
fairly  high.  According  to  the  1960  Census,  43  per  cent  had  at-
tended college,  27  per cent graduating;  only 28  per cent had not 
received a high school diploma. 

Although  these  statistics  suggest  that  most  Levittowners  were 
lower middle class,  they still  overestimate  the upper middle and 
working class  populations.  Most  of  the  professionals  were  teach-
ers  and social  workers;  only  10  per cent of them were doctors or 
lawyers.  Also,  the  majority  of  those  who  attended  college  had 
gone  to  junior  and  community  colleges,  small  private  schools, 
and  state  universities;  probably  less  than  10  per  cent  had  at-
tended  the  "name"  universities  of  high  educational  and  social 
status.  I  would guess  that  no  more  than  5  to  10  per cent of  the 
Levittowners could be considered upper middle class. 

Conversely,  most  of  the  blue collar  Levittowners  were  in  the 
highest-skill,  highest-status manual occupations, such  as  foremen, 
printers,  electricians,  and  plumbers,  and  10  per  cent  had  at-
tended college.  Many were  trying to raise  their children for mid-
dle  class  careers,  and  I  suspect  that  the  proportion  of  families 
who  were  working class  in  terms  of  family  culture  was  smaller 
than the proportion working at blue collar trades-perhaps only 
20  per cent of  the  total  population.  Thus, about  75  per cent of 
the  community  might  be  considered  lower  middle  class,  cul-
turally speaking. 

Thirty-seven per cent of the families were Roman Catholic;  47 
per  cent  were  Protestant-with  Methodists,  Lutherans,  Presby-
terians,  and  Baptists  in  the  majority;  and  14  per  cent  were 
Jewish,  the majority Conservative. This distribution is similar to 
that  of  Levittown,  Pennsylvania,  and  of  the  Philadelphia  met-
ropolitan  are<i;,generally.  The  vast  majority,  66  per  cent,  were 
third and fourth generation Americans;  28  per cent were second 
generation  (native  born of foreign  parents)  and 6  per cent were 
foreign  born.  Thirty-seven  per cent reported  being of  Northern

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

European  origin  (English,  German,  or  Scandinavian);  17  per 
cent were  Eastern  European  (mostly  Russian  Jewish with a  scat-
tering 'of  Poles);  10  per cent,  Irish;  9  per  cent,  Southern  Euro-
pean  (mainly Italian), and  the remainder a  heady mixture of all 
of these  backgrounds.  Most came from  acculturated homes,  how-
ever,  with  little  evidenc~ of  ethnic  culture  remaining  except 
among Jews and a  handful  of Greeks,  Chinese,  and Japanese.  In 
1964,  less  than  1  per cent of  the  population  was  Negro,  most  of 
these  families  having  moved  in  after  my  study  was  completed. 

MAJOR  SUBCULTURES  AMONG  THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

Statistics do not provide a  complete  picture of the  Levittowners 
and  how  they  vary,  and  figures  must  be  fleshed  out  by  ethno-
gTaphic  description.  Age  and  life-cycle  position  are  important 
sources  of diversity  in American  society,  but most  Levittowners 
are young couples.  Given  the declining influence on behavior of 
regional  origin, religious preference, and ethnic background, the 
crucial  source  of  variety  in  Levittown  is  class  and  class  subcul-
ture. 

Classes  are  strata-with-subcultures  that  grow  out  of  the  struc-
ture of the national  economy and society.5  By  class  subcultures  I 
mean sets of responses  that have developed out of people's efforts 
to cope with the opportunities, incentives, and rewards, as well as 
the  deprivations,  prohibitions,  and  pressures,  which  the  natural 
environment and society offer to them. 

From  another  perspective,  subcultures  are  predispositions  to 
behavior, ways  of acting to be followed  when the social  situation 
permits  it.  For  example,  the  desire  for  community  activity  is  a 
major source of differentiation between lower middle and upper 
middle class  subcultures.  People of  the latter class  are  more  pre-
disposed  to  routine  involvement  in  civic  ventures;  those  of  the 
former  participate  only  when  there  is  a  political  threat  to  their 
homes  and families  or when  occupational  roles  require  it,  as  in 
the case of a  lawyer or insurance salesman who must advertise his 
services  through  community activities  in  order  to  earn  a  living. 
The social  situations with which  people must cope and the roles 
they  normally  play  are,  of course,  the  most  important  determi-
nants  of  behavior,  but  cultural  predispositions  help  to  explain 
why  people  act  differently  in  the  same  social  situation  or  role. 
Finally,  subcultures  are  aggregates  of  predispositions,  so  that 

The  Levittowners-and  Why  They  Came 

•  25  • 

where  one  is  found  (for  example,  civic  activity),  another  (buy-
ing gourmet  foods  or  reading  a  magazine  like  Harper's)  is  also 
likely  to  be  present.  Predispositions  are  related  or  aggregated, 
sometimes into a fairly stable system, because the situations which 
people face  and the responses  they make are often similar, and it 
is  these  similarities  which  are  estimated  when  class  is  measured 
by  income,  occupation,  or  education.  At  one  time,  occupation 
was  an easy clue  to the rest of a  person's culture,  but among the 
Levittowners  education  is  probably  the  best  index,  for  years  of 
schooling  and  the  quality  of  the  school  attended  influence 
strongly  the  job  for  which  a  person  is  eligible,  the  amount  of 
money he  has  to  spend,  the  kind  of woman  he  marries,  and  the 
way he and his family will spend their leisure hours. 

The  people  who  came  to  Levittown  may  be  distinguished  as 
"belonging"  to  three  major  class  subcultures,  which  can  be 
labeled  as  working  class,  lower  middle  class,  and  upper  middle 
class.  They must be described in very general  terms,  ignoring for 
the  sake  of clarity  the  many  nuances and  diversities  which  each 
individual, by virtue of his upbringing and experience, expresses 
in  acting  upon  his  own  predispositions.  At  best,  then,  the  de-
scriptions  that  follow  are  brief  profiles;  at  worst,  they  are  only 
stereotypes. 6 

The Working Class 

The way of life I call "working class subculture" is  to be found 
not  only  among  blue  collar  workers,  but  also  among  lower-
echelon  white  collar  workers  and  among  people  who  did  not 
graduate  from  high  school.  In  the  white  population,  many  are 
Catholics,  and  of  Irish,  Italian,  and  Southern  or  Eastern  Euro-
pean  peasant  backgrounds.  The vestiges  of  this  origin  are  espe-
cially  strong  in  family  life.  The  typical  working  class  family  is 
sexually segregated.  Husbands and wives exchange love and affec-
tion,  but  they  have  separate  family  roles  and  engage  in  little  of 
the  companionship found  in  the  middle  classes.  The husband  is 
the breadwinner and  the enforcer of child discipline;  the wife  is 
the  housekeeper and rears  the children.  Whenever  possible,  hus-
bands spend their free  time with other male companions, women 
with other women.  Entertaining is  rarer than in the middle class, 
and  most  social  life  takes  place  among  relatives  and  childhood 
friends.  When  they are not available,  there  is  occasional  visiting 
with neighbors and also a  tendency for  husband and wife to draw 

•  26  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

closer to each other.7  Even so,  it is  significant that the first organ-
ization  to  be founded  in  Levittown  was  the Veterans of  Foreign 
Wars, its predominantly working class membership quickly mak-
ing it a  suburban  substitute  for  the  city's  neighborhood  tavern. 
Parent-child relationships are adult-centered.  Children are ex-
pected  to  behave  according  to  adult  rules  and  are  often  disci-
plined  when  they  act as  children.  Therefore,  the  young child  is 
supervised strictly and  his  life  is  bounded  by  a  large  number of 
rules,  deviation  from  which  is  punished  affectionately  but,  by 
middle  class  standards,  harshly.  The  main  purpose  of  child-
rearing is  to make sure that the child stays out of trouble-that is, 
does not get into difficulties with the school or the police. For this 
reason,  working  class  parents  expect  the  school  to  enforce  disci-
pline. Children react to these  parental demands by seeking to get 
out of the house at an early age and to give up the family  for  the 
peer  group  as  soon  as  possible.  For  some  years  there  is  familial 
conflict  over  this  move,  but,  generally  speaking,  working  class 
parents  give  their  children  freedom  sooner  than  middle  class 
parents do. They often expect the child to get into trouble by the 
time  he  reaches  adolescence,  and  accept  its  occurrence  fatalis-
tically.  By  then  the child,  especially  the  boy,  is  expected  to  be a 
near-adult and responsible for himself. 

Socially mobile working class families attempt to prolong adult 
control,  especially over school  behavior.  Since  parents know  that 
mobility  can  only  be  achieved  by  educational  success,  they  put 
pressure  on  their children  to  do  well  in  school.  Not  being well 
equipped  to  help  the  child,  however,  they  cari  only  continually 
urge  him  to  work  harder  at  his  studies.  Often,  this  kind  of 
pressure  is  ineffective,  and  mobile  families  find  to  their  disap-
pointment  that  the  child  does  poorly  in  school.  In  nonmobile 
families,  children  are  expected  to  finish  whatever  schooling  is 
necessary to obtain good-that is, secure and stable-jobs. By now 
high  school  graduation  is  considered  desirable,  and  if  a  boy  is 
academically  successful,  the  parents  will  make  an  effort  to  send 
him  to  college.  However,  there  are  usually  so  many  opposing 
peer  group  influences  and  other  pressures  that  by  the  time  the 
child reaches college  age  he is  neither able nor willing to go  on. 
Working class  culture provides  few  of  the skills  and  attitudes 
needed  for  organizational  activities.  People  find  it  extremely 
difficult  to accept  the validity of values and interests which con-
flict  with theirs;  they have  trouble relating to strangers and mak-

The  Levittowners-and  Why  They  Came

ing  decisions  in  a  group-or for  the  group.  Also,  they  tend  to 
view  political  and  other  organizations  with  the  same  moral 
measuringstick as  the  family,  and  expect  similarly altruistic  be-
havior  from  such  organizations.  This  produces  a  highly  person-
alistic  view  of government  and  associations,  and  when  their ac-
tions are undesirable,  they are seen as  tools of unscrupulous indi-
viduals out for  personal gain.  More generally, working class  peo-
ple  believe-with  some  justification-that  these  agencies  are  es-
tablished to benefit the business community and the middle class, 
and  to deprive "working people"  of their rightful share of goods 
and  privileges.  As  a  result,  they are  highly suspicious of  private 
and governmental organizations and reject them when their aims 
do  not  accord  with  working  class  priorities.  In  a  middle  class 
community  then,  people  of  working  class  culture  stay  close  to 
home  and  make  the  house  a  haven  against  a  hostile  outside 
world. 8 

The Lower Middle Class 

Probably three quarters of the Levittowners follow  the  predis-
position of lower middle class culture. They are some of the blue 
collar workers,  the white collar ones,  and even many of  the pro-
fessionals;  they  are  people who  have  completed  high  school  and 
perhaps a vocationally or a  nonintellectually-oriented liberal arts 
college. 

The lower  middle  class  family  is  sexually less  segregated  than 
the  working class  one.  Husbands  and  wives  are  closer  to  being 
companions,  for  both sexes  have learned to share a  few  common 
interests and to  participate to some  extent in each other's world. 
Since neither man nor woman is likely to have an intense outside 
avocation,  the  home  and  the  family  are  the  focal  point  for 
mutuality.  Partly  because  the  common  interest  is  in  the  home, 
the  lower  middle  class  family  is  child-centered.  This  character-
istic must not be exaggerated, however,  for  the image so  popular 
in the mass  media--of impotent  parents dominated  by  their  de-
manding children-is inaccurate, except perhaps among  families 
from  extremely  poor  beginnings,  who  want  their  children  to 
have  everything  they  missed  and  then  cannot  cope  with  their 
ceaseless  requests.  Most  lower  middle  class  families  are  child-
centered only  to  the extent that the  home is  run for  both adults 
and children,  and  the children are allowed  to be  themselves and 
to act as  children.  At the same  time,  they are  raised  strictly,  for 

•  28  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

parents are  fearful  of spoiling them.  Lower middle class  parents 
play  with  their children  much  more  than  working class  parents 
do.  Partly  for  this  reason,  they  do  not  relinquish  control  over 
their children so quickly. They believe in the value of school and 
church, but do not want these institutions to transform  the child 
or to  make demands  that would alienate it from  the home.  The 
working class  sees  these  institutions as  keeping the child  in line; 
the  lower  middle  class  wants  them  to  support  the  home  and  its 
values. 

In education the lower middle class prefers a modern approach 
without undue pressure on the child, with every child  treated as 
an  individual-but ·not as  a  unique  or  different  one,  as  upper 
middle  class  parents  favor.  Social  adjustment  is  as  important as 
academic  success:  it  is  hoped  that  the  children  will  be accepted 
by  peers  of  equal  status.  Educational  achievement  is  important; 
lower  middle  class  parents  want  their  children  to  go  to  college, 
because  higher  education  is  a  prerequisite  to  a  respectable  and 
well-paid job and a good marriage. 

One reason for  the child-centeredness of the lower middle class 
family  is  that such  a  family  type  is  nuclear-that  is,  consisting 
only of parents and children.  In  America,  the clanlike extended 
family  is  highly valued only in the working class,  in some ethnic 
groups  of  all  classes,  and  for  other  reasons,  in  the  upper class. 
Lower middle class  people still  love and visit  their relatives,  but 
if they are too far away to visit,  they are not especially missed,  for 
lower middle class  people are able  to make friends.  Their social 
life is  informal and involves primarily neighbors and friends met 
through organizational activities. 

Many  lower  middle class  people are also active  in church and 
in voluntary associations.  The church reinforces their view of the 
world as  run  by  morality,  in  which goodness,  kindness,  honesty, 
and  altruism  are  important  motive  forces  to  action,  and  evil  is 
the result of evil impulses. Of course, the church is important also 
as  a source of fellowship;  here people can find  friends  with simi-
lar viewpoints, and of similar class level as well, and without hav-
ing  to  admit  this  aim  as  a  motivation.  Parents  support  such 
organizations  as  the  PTA  and  the  Scouts,  which  uphold  the 
cultural  values  of  orderliness,  self-reliance,  constructive  leisure, 
and above  all,  the  primacy of  the home and its mOTal  strictures. 
People  also  belong  to  purely  adult  associations,  many  still  sex-
segregated,  which  combine  sociability  with  community  service. 
As  in the case  of  the working class,  the  lower  middle  class  nor-

The  Levittowners-and  Why  They  Came 

•  29  • 

mally  has  little  interest  in  government.  The  working  class 
distrusts  politicians  because  they  are  seen  as  enriching  them-
selves;  the  lower  middle  class  is  wary  of  politicians  as  dishonest 
and opportunistic. If government is  immoral, the best solution is 
to keep its  functions and  power minimal;  the  ideal  is  a  business-
man  or a  city  manager  who  will  do away  with  politics  and  will 
also keep taxes low. 

Today,  the  lower middle class  must be divided into restrictive 
and expansive  subgroups.  The former  includes most  Protestants 
and those Catholics (especially of Irish origin) who have adopted 
the Calvinist-Puritan tradition of pre-twentieth century America. 
This  tradition  arose  in  the  small  towns  of America,  and  its  ad-
herents still harbor considerable suspicion of the city and its peo· 
pie,  but especially  of  the  "action-seeking,"  adventurous  working 
class and the urbane and cosmopolitan  upper middle class.  They 
try  to  lead  sober  and  controlled  lives,  with  little  drinking  or 
partying other than the ubiquitous card parties.  Ostentation and 
gaudiness  are  shunned,  as  are  excitement  and  sensuality,  which 
may  be enjoyed only vicariously  in  the mass  media.  The expan· 
sive  group  includes  other Catholics,  Jews,  and  those  Protestant~ 
who  share  their  European,  non-Puritan  origins,  particularly 
those who have moved into the middle class from  urban working 
class and ethnic origins.  Members of the expansive subgroup buy 
more impulsively,  enjoy an aggressively active social life, and are 
willing  to  drink,  gamble,  and  enjoy  openly  the  offerings  of 
modern show business. 

Lower  middle  class  culture  is  often  accused  of  being  overly 
concerned with respectability and keeping up appearances.  This 
is  probably  truer of the  restrictive  than of  the  expansive  group, 
for  the  former  is  essentially attempting  to  maintain a  past  tradi-
tion.  Even  so,  there  is  more  of a  conflict  between  the  ideal  and 
the real  in the lower middle class  than  in  the working class.  The 
latter  has  few  pretensions  about  the  world  and  expresses  its 
idealism  as  cynicism;  working  class  people  have  suffered  too 
much from reality to believe that things could be much different. 
Lower middle class  people,  however,  still  defend a  preindustrial 
moral code which sometimes requires the hypocrisy that has been 
noted in contemporary lower middle class life. 

The Upper Middle Class 

A  small  proportion of managers  and  professionals  have  found 
their way to  Levittown, at least temporarily,  and although  many 

•  80  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

are not yet upper middle class in income or status, they will be in 
years  to  come.  Theirs  is  already  the  culture  of  the  college-
educated,  cosmopolitan  population,  trained  to  be  interested  in 
and  to  participate  in  the  larger  world.  Home  and  family  are 
somewhat  less  important  to  this  than  to  the  other  classes.  The 
upper middle class  family has shed almost all  sexual segregation, 
for college attendance has  trained women  for  organizational and 
occupational skills which they can and want to pursue even while 
being  mothers  and  housewives.  The  wife  still  does  the  house-
work-though she  is  likely  to  have  domestic  help  to  release  her 
for other activities-but many of the child-rearing functions may 
be  shared  with  the  husband.  Interests  other  than  those  of  the 
home can also be shared by the spouses and, conversely,  each can 
have interests that take them away from the home. One-but not 
the only one--of the shared interests  is  the children. The upper 
middle class  is  concerned with  the development of the child as  a 
unique  individual,  one  who  can  perform  autonomously  in  all 
spheres of life valued by  the  upper middle class,  especiaily a  re-
warding  professional  career.  In  order  to  achieve  these  aims, 
parents  provide  direction  for  the  lives  of  their children,  so  that 
while  family  life  is  child-centered,  it is  also  adult-directed.  The 
children are encouraged and even  pressured to do well  in school 
and  parents  are concerned  that  the  scho9l  their children attend 
not only provide a good  education but also  demand a  high level 
of  performance. 9 

Since  most  upper  middle  class  people  (at  least  in  Levittown) 
have  achieved  their  present  position  by  their  own  individual 
achievement,  the  relationship  with  the  extended  family  is  even 
more tenuous than in the lower middle class.  Upper middle class 
people are good at making friends,  and choose them on the basis 
of shared interests.  There is a considerable amount of social  life, 
although the parties and entertaining may be devoted as  much to 
shop talk and civic affairs as  to the gossip and small talk that con-
stitute the staple of social  conversation among other groups. 

Upper  middle  class  people  participate  not  only  in  voluntary 
associations but· in  the entire community. As cosmopolitans,  they 
want to shape the community by national values  which  may  not 
respect local  traditions. 1° For example, they are less  interested in 
having  the  school  system  be superior  to  that of nearby commu-
nities than  in  making sure  that foreign  languages  are  taught  in 
the  elementary grades.  For  this  population,  community  partici-

The  Levittowners--and  Why  They  Came 

•  31  • 

pation  is  almost  a  cultural  duty.  Although  upper  middle  class 
people  are as  distrustful  of  politicians  as  others,  they  have  both 
the  skills and  the status  to  become  involved  in government and 
to fight for what they think is desirable. Needing the community's 
public institutions  to provide cosmopolitan educational  and cul-
tural services that cannot be made available at home, they favor a 
high  level  of  public  expenditure,  to  be  parceled  out  by  well-
educated, nonpartisan political leaders of their own class. 

Upper middle class  culture can  also  be  divided  into  two  sub-
groups  which  might  be  called  conservative-managerial  and  lib-
eral-professional. The former is often  thought of as  "the business 
community,'' and  its  people are  likely  to  be  politically  and  cul-
turally conservative. The latter are frequently Jewish, and politi-
cally and culturally liberal, and are employed in the community-
centered  professions  such as  education and social  work.  In some 
ways,  the distinction  between the two groups is similar to the re-
strictive and expansive distinction in the lower middle class.  The 
conservative-managerial  upper  middle  class  has  also  come  from 
Protestant  origins,  although  its  behavior  is  less  restrictive.  The 
liberal-professional  upper middle class  is  unusually active  in  the 
community.  Aside  from  its  personal  interest  in good  schools--a 
characteristic  it shares  with  the managerial  group--it also  fights 
for  well-known  liberal  causes such  as  better race  relations,  com-
munity  planning,  mental  health,  and  the  United  Nations.  In-
deed,  it is  much  more cosmopolitan  than  the managerial  group, 
more  sensitive  to  "ideas"  in  the  abstract  and  to  national  issues 
than the latter. The managerial group may often oppose the pro-
fessional  group  here,  for  the  former,  being allied  with  business, 
favors low taxes and opposes the liberalism that is  inherent in the 
cosmopolitan stance.  Liberal-professionals are the main audience 
for high culture. They go  to concerts, plays, and museums in the 
big cities;  they organize lectures, art exhibitions, and visits  from 
famous performers in the suburbs. The managerial group is more 
likely to put its energies into golf and the country club which the 
liberal-professionals shun. 

MOVING TO LEVITTOWN 

Most  New  Jersey  Levittowners  who  bought  in  the  first  two 
years--77  per cent altogether-<:ame from  the Philadelphia met-
ropolitan  area,  nearby  New  Jersey  counties,  and  the  states  sur-

•  32  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

rounding  New  Jersey.  Almost  half  (46  per cent)  had  previously 
lived in what they described as  suburban neighborhoods  (includ-
ing 8 per cent from  Levittown, Pennsylvania); a  third came from 
urban  areas  (19  per  cent  from  Philadelphia);  and  19  per  cent 
came from  small  towns.  (The rest came from  farms  or from army 
camps,  here and abroad.) Although  6o  per cent had been renters 
before,  only  39  per  cent  moved  to  Levittown  from  apartments; 
for  53  per cent Levittown was  their first  house purchase, and for 
another  32  per  cent,  their  second. 11  Many  purchasers  were 
mobile,  the  median  Levittowner  having  moved  once  for  every 
two  and  a  half  years  of  married  life,  and  17  per  cent,  once  for 
every  year of marriage.  Some  were ·quite stable,  however,  13  per 
cent  having  moved  less  than  once  for  every  five  years  of  mar-
riage.12 

People's  reasons  for  moving  to  Levittown  were  primarily  the 
need  for  more  spacious  housing  and  the  desire  to  own  a  free-
standing  house-"to  own  our  own  home,"  as  many  put  itP 
Table  1 shows  that  these  reasons,  together  with  transfers  to  the 
Philadelphia area by  the purchasers' employers were volunteered 
most  frequently  as  the  principal  reason  for  moving  out  of  the 
previous  residence. 14  More  important,  the  vast  majority  were 
moving  because  of  the  inadequacy  of  the  housing.  Only  9  per 
cent  volunteered  the  inadequacy  of  the  neighborhood  or  com-
munity  as  the  most  important  reason,  mostly  city  dwellers. 

The purchasers could have moved  to Levittown either because 
they  needed  to  leave  their  prior  residence  or  because  they  were 
attracted  by  suburbia  and  by  Levittown-because  they  were 
pushed or pulled. 15  An analysis of how  they worded  their volun-
teered reasons for  leaving their previous residence indicated that 
more  were  pushed  than  pulled,  55  per  cent  indicating  the 
former,  34  per cent  the  latter.  The people with  the most urgent 
space needs,  large families  and blue collar workers,  were  pushed 
most  often,  but  only  among  childless  couples  did  those  pulled 
outnumber  those  pushed.  Even  apartment  dwellers  and  ten-
ants,  who  might  have  been  expected  to  want  home  ownership, 
were  pushed more often  than  they were pulled,  indicating again 
that  the need for  space  was  more urgent than all  the  possible at-
tractions  of suburbia in  explaining why  people moved  to  Levit-
town. 

The major  reason  for  choosing  Levittown  specifically,  people 
explained,  waa  that  it  offered  "the  best  house  for  the  money";

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

that is, a new single-family house which was the best value within 
their price range. 16  Many had  shopped around,  52  per cent hav-
ing inspected  ten  or more  other developments,  and  38  per cent 
having looked  at houses for  from  one to five  years  before buying 
in "Levittown.  Table  2  describes  in  more detail  their reasons for 
choosing Levittown. Eighty-four per cent came primarily because 
of factors  relating  to  the  house;  only a  few  considered  the  facil-
itie~ and social  quality of  the community their major reason  for 
coming.  No one volunteered as  a reason  for  purchase the mixing 
of house  types,  and  even  the availability of schools at time of ar-
rival was  mentioned by less  than 0.5  per cent. When people were 
asked  to  check a  list  of "other reasons"  for  moving,  however,  84 
per cent  checked  off  th~ availability  of schools;  81  per  cent,  of 
pools;  and  87  per  cent,  of  shopping.  Seventy-two  per  cent  ap-
proved the mixing of house  types,  but only 44 per cent,  the 6500 
square  foot  lots,  and  no  more  than  40  per  cent  considered  the 
kinds of neighbors they could expect in Levittown as a reason for 
buying there.  Clearly,  some  features  of  the community were not 
unimportant,  but  they  were  hardly  the  most  important  reason 
for buying in Levittown. 

Although husbands and wives generally agreed on the need for 
the  move,  the men more often decided on  Levittown,  largely for 
reasons  of economy,  whereas  the women  seem  to  have  wanted  a 
more  expensive  community. 17  Even  so,  for  an  estimated  So  per 
cent  of  the  buyers,  the  move  meant  an  increase  in  housing  ex-
penditures.  Roughly  speaking,  it  cost  $125  to  $150  a  month  to 
buy in Levittown during the early years,  and $140  to $165 when 
taxes  rose  later. 18  On  the  average,  Levittowners  were  paying 
about  33  to 50 per cent more for  housing than before. Still,  they 
were  not  paying  very  much;  the  median  Levittowner  devoted 
only about  15  per cent of his income  to housing before  the move 
and about  21  per cent afterwards,  well  within  the  20  to  25  per 
cent  generally  considered  reasonable  by  the  experts.  However, 
among  the  21  per  cent  earning  less  than  $5500,  those  without 
other sources of funds must have been paying at least 28  per cent 
of  their  income  for  the  new  house,  and  they  were  confronted 
with  financial  problems  when  living  costs  and  taxes  went  up. 
Many of the  buyers had come  to  Levittown  to settle down. At 
the  time of arrival,  44  per cent said  they  intended  to settle  per-
manently;  20  per cent  knew  already  they  would  be  transferred 
again  by  their  employers;  12  per cent  thought  they  wanted  to

move  again,  hopefully  to  a  more  expensive  house;  and  24  per 
cent were undecided.18 Those whose plans were firm at this stage 
can be divided into Settlers, 57  per cent; Transients, 27  per cent; 
and Mobiles,  16  per cent. The Settlers were somewhat older than 
the average Levittowner, with more children, lower incomes, and 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

less  education. Only 13  per cent had gone to college, compared to 
So  per cent of the Mobiles and Transients;  40 per cent were blue 
collar workers,  but only  12  per cent of the Mobiles were;  and 13 
per  cent  were  professionals,  as  compared  to  31  per  cent  of  the 
Mobiles and  21  per cent of the Transients.  Forty-two per cent of 
the Settlers were Catholics, whereas 65  per cent of the Transients 
were Protestants, indicating the extent to which  the armed forces 
and the large national corporations still select or attract from  the 
latter religious  group.  The Settlers come by  the label  rightfully; 
on I y half had recorded a  move for  every  three years  of marriage, 
as  compared  to  83  per cent of the  Mobiles and fully 91  per cent 
of  the  Transients.  In  fact,  78  per  cent  of  the  Transients  had 
moved at least once for every two years of marriage. 

(These data  would  suggest  that  in  the  long  run,  if  the  Tran· 
sients  and  Mobiles  do  leave  and  are  not  replaced,  Levittown 
could  become  a  predominantly  working  class  community.  Al-
though  this  may  be  taking  place  in  the  first  of  the  Levittowns, 
now almost  twenty years old,  it is  too early  to tell whether it will 
happen  in  Levittown,  New  Jersey,  particularly since  the  rise  in 
house  prices  during  the  1g6os  attracted  a  somewhat  higher-
income population than the initial arrivals I  studied.20) 

The  Move  from  City to  Suburb 

The  third  of  the  Levittowners  who  came  from  cities  or from 
areas  they described  as  urban  neighborhoods were  slightly older 
than  previous  suburbanites,  more  often  apartment  dwellers  and 
tenants,  Catholics, less  mobile, and more likely  to want to settle. 
They moved  out of  the cities  principally for  more  space  and  in 
order  to  own  a  single-family  house,  although  those  who  came 
from  aging  apartments  and  row  houses  placed  special  emphasis 
on  getting  a  brand  new  house  and  having  a  yard  for  the  chil-
dren. 

As Table 1 indicates, they were slightly more impelled to move 
by  community  conditions  than  were  suburbanites,  for  19  per 
cent  of  them  gave  such  conditions as  the  major reason  for  mov-
ing.  Both in their volunteered reasons and in those they checked 
off,  their main complaint was a  general one;  49  per cent checked 
"we  just  wanted  to  get  out  of  the  city"  and  34  per  cent,  "the 
neighborhood  is  poor  for  raising  children."  An  equal  number 
mentioned  lack  of  playgrounds  and  "urban  dirt,  noise,  and 
traffic." 

The  Levittowners-and  Why  They  Came 

•  37  • 

The reasons  most often advanced for  the so-called flight  to  the 
suburbs  were  of  less  concern  to  the  city  dwellers  who  came  to 
Levittown.  Fewer  of  them  than  those  already  in  the  suburbs 
complained about a  long journey to work.  Only 4  per cent vol-
unteered racial  change in the neighborhood as  their most impor-
tant reason, although 20 per cent checked it as  one reason among 
many, and yet others may have been reluctant to do so  or consid-
ered racial change one reason why the neighborhood was poor for 
raising children. Less than 2  per cent volunteered the low quality 
of schools  as  their  first  reason  for  leaving  the  city;  20  per cent 
checked  it  as  one  of  the  reasons-but  that  was  14  per cent  less 
than those concerned about lack of playgrounds. 

Nor were  they leaving the city only to benefit their children.21 
When I  asked the purchasers whether "they would  prefer  to  live 
in the city if it were not for  the children," 87  per cent responded 
negatively  (86  per  cent  of  the  urbanites  and  go  per cent  of  the 
suburbanites).  The college  educated  were  only  a  couple  of  per-
centage points more favorable to the city than those who dropped 
out  of  high  school,  and  sex  made  no difference  at  all,  but reli-
gious  preference  did.  Jews  were  the  most  favorable  to  the  city, 
and  Protestants  the  least:  23  per  cent  of Jewish  women,  19  per 
cent of the men,  14  per cent of all Catholics, and only 8 per cent 
of all  Protestants expressed preference for the city. 

Of course,  this  question was  asked  of a  population  which  had 
just bought a house in the suburbs. Still,  they did not regret leav-
ing the city, nor did they flee  from  it.  And they certainly did not 
move to "suburbia" to find  the social  and spiritual qualities  that 
various  writers  have  assigned  to  it.  They were  not  looking  for 
roots  or  a  rural  idyll,  not  for  a  social  ethic  or  a  consumption-
centered life,  not for civic participation or for  "sense of commu-
nity."  They wanted  the  good  or comfortable  life  for  themselves 
and  their  families,  and  the  anticipated  peacefulness  of  outdoor 
living,  but mainly  they  came  "for a  house  and  not  a  social  en-
vironment." 22 

ASPffiATIONS  FOR  LIFE  IN LEVI'ITOWN 

Although only about a  third of the people who filled out the mail 
questionnaire said they had given "a lot of thought" to what they 
wanted  their life  in Levittown  to be like,  go  per cent of all  mail 
questionnaire  respondents  volunteered  things  they  "especially 

•  38  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

looked f-orward  to about  (their)  life  in  Levittown,"  and  the  list 
of aspirations was  the same for  those who had and those who had 
not  thought  seriously  about  the  future. 23 

Essentially,  they  wanted  more  comfortable  and  modern  sur-
roundings,  but they did not want to change their old way of life 
or to make a  new one in the new community. About half bought 
in Levittown because  it was  a  new community, but their reasons 
indicate they were referring to the new house;  about 40 per cent 
wanted  to  make  some  changes  in  their  lives,  but  the  changes 
listed also had to do mainly with the house. 

The  aspirations  people  volunteered  before  moving  to  Levit-
town,  summarized  in Table 3·  express  the same  themes  in  more 
detail. The largest number of purchasers hoped that a new house 
would give them a more comfortable and less crowded place, and 
that  owning  their  home  would  provide  privacy  from  neighbors 
and  freedom  of  action  and  self-expression.  As  one  respondent 
wrote,  "I  wanted  a  more  casual  way  of  life  and a  less  cramped 
one.  In your own  home  you  can  do as  you  please."  While some 
hoped the new house would enable parents and children to spend 
more  time  and  do  more  things  together,  an  equal  proportion 
looked  fonvard  to continuing their accustomed  family  duties as 
"homemakers" and providers.  In fact,  the desire for newness and 
change  was  limited  to  meeting  new  people  and  making  new 
friends. 

The  major  source  of diversity  in  aspirations  was  by  sex.  The 
men  especially  looked  forward  to  "the  peace  and  quiet  of  the 
country after the day's work," what some called "outdoor living," 
as  well  as  the  opportunity  to  "putter  around  the  house  and 
yard." The women placed most stress on making new friends and 
"having  nice  neighbors."  In  response  to  a  checklist  question  to 
test  attitudes  on various  kinds of social  relations,  So  per cent of 
all respondents checked looking forward  to meeting new people; 
71  per cent,  to  "having neighbors of similar age  and  interests"; 
55  per cent, to "meeting people with different interests and back· 
grounds";  ana  54  per  cent,  to  "having  more  desirable  neigh-
bors."  On all  items, Jews and  Mobiles scored  highest. The desire 
for  homogeneity  was  greatest  among  women,  for  heterogeneity 
among the  well  educated,  and  for  "desirable neighbors"  among 
those with least status--the blue collar workers and  the least ed-
ucated.  Urban  residents  also  looked  forward  more  to  home 
ownership  and  its  consequences  for  family  life  and  relaxation,

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

whereas  those  who  had  already  lived  in  the  suburbs  and  had 
achieved  these  goals  anticipated  the  comfort  and  modernity  of 
the new house. 

Altogether,  about  95  per  cent  of  the  respondents  who  volun-
teered  aspirations  hoped  for  improved  individual,  family,  and 
social life;  and less  than ·5  per cent for  identification with and ac-
tivities in the wider community. A checklist question distinguish-
ing  between  different  types  of  community  activities,  however, 
showed  that  55  per  cent  looked  forward  to  "having  a  voice  in 
community  affairs";  45  per  cent,  to  "being  active  in  civic 
groups"; but only 28  per cent to "joining clubs."  Interest in poli-
tical  and  civic  activity  was  greatest  among  the  higher-status  and 
better-educated  residents,  but also  among  the  Settlers  and  those 
who  expected to be a  minority in  the  community-the childless, 
Jews;  and  other  ethnic  group  members.  Those  who  moved  to 
Levittown  as  a  new community and  those  who occupied  its  first 
neighborhood  were  more  interested  in  joining  civic  groups, 
whereas  those  who  moved  into  the  second  and  third  neighbor-
hoods  were  more  concerned  with  having a  voice  in  community 
affairs,  perhaps fearful  that the earliest residents would take over 
the government. Club activity was mentioned more often by low-
status respondents. 2' 

That  individual  and  family  aspirations  were  more  important 
than  community  ones  is  neither  a  novel  finding  nor  one  that 
should be attacked on moral grounds. The same  priorities would 
probably be assigned  by any other group studied,  including even 
the people who  bemoan  the modern lack of interest in "commu-
nity." In part,  the findings  are a  result of the method. The ques-
tionnaire  asked  only  for  the  "most  important"  aspirations.  Pre-
sumably,  if  people  had  been  asked  to  list  all  their  aspirations, 
more  would  eventually  have  mentioned  community  values. 25 
Also,  such  aspirations  are  difficult  to  think  about  before  the 
move,  especially  to  a  new  community  as  yet  without  organiza-
tions. If the same question had been asked after a year's residence 
in  Levittown,  people  would  probably  have  mentioned  commu-
nity aspirations more frequently. 

Nevertheless,  both  the reasons  for  moving and  the  aspirations 
suggest  clearly  that  when  people  move  into  a  new  community 
they  do  so  primarily  for  a  house.  Half  the  volunteered  aspira-
tions,  two  thirds  of  the  moving  reasons,  and  four  fifths  of  all 
reasons for  buying in Levittown were house-related;  to put it an-

The  Levittowners-and  Why  They  Came 

•  41  • 

other way,  for  So  per cent  of  the  purchasers,  the  house  was  the 
major reason for coming. This would justify Levitt's emphasis on 
providing  "the  best  house  for  money."  One  could  even  argue 
that  from  a  market  point  of  view,  the  firm's  site  planning and 
other community  innovations  were  not  necessary,  at  least  to  at-
tract the original set of purchasers. That people did not move be-
cause of the availability of schools suggests not that they were un-
interested  in  schools,  however,  but  only  that  they  knew  schools 
were  being provided and  were  not  particularly concerned  about 
the  quality  of  the  education  their  children  would  be  receiving. 
House-related  reasons  for  moving  and  aspirations  may  have 
been  higher  in  Levittown  than  elsewhere  because  the  Levitt 
houses  were  thought  to  be  such  an  unusual  value.  Even  so,  the 
data  permit  one  to  suggest  that  any  plan  for  a  new  community 
which does  not make  sure  that  the house  is  as  good as  any other 
in  the market area is  bound to run into difficulty,  particularly if 
novel  and  as  yet  unaccepted  ideas  on  community  planning  are 
tried  out.  In  the  last  analysis,  most  people  spend  most  of  their 
time  in  the  house  and  the  community  is  of  secondary  impor-
tance. 

The data also  suggest  that  the  evolution  of  a  new  community 
may  not  be affected  by  the  aspirations  with which  people  move 
into  it.  Being most  concerned  with  individual  and family  goals, 
they will  leave  the development  of  the community to  others,  re-
serving  for  themselves  only  the  veto  power  over  their  actions. 
What actually  happened  when  the  purchasers  moved  in  will  be 
told in the next five  chapters. 

NOTES 

1.  Unless  otherwise  indicated,  these  data  are  from  a  mail  question-
naire returned by  two  thirds  of  the  first  gooo  home  buyers.  Gen-
erally  speaking,  older,  poorer,  and  poorly  educated  buyers  were 
less  likely  to  answer,  and  although  this  was  corrected  for  in  the 
analysis, the findings still underemphasize that portion of the pop-
ulation.  The method  by  which  the  questionnaires  were  sampled 
and analyzed  is  described  in  the  Appendix. 

2.  They were  also  quite like  the  residents of the earlier Levittowns. 
For the population characteristics of Levittown, New York, shortly 
after  the  purchasers'  arrival,  see  LieU  (1952);  for  today,  see  Doh-

43  per cent  to  be  between  thirty  and  thirty-nine,  and only  6  per 
cent  to  be  over  fifty-five. 

4·  According  to  the  Census,  by  1960  median  family  income  was

with  13  per cent of  the  families  still  earning less  than  $6ooo.  As 
I indicated earlier, people who earned less  than $5500 had to make 
higher down  payments.

11.  The  high  proportion  of  renters  who  had  lived  in  houses,  40  per 
cent,  is  a  peculiarity  of  the  Philadelphia  area,  which  is  built up 
mainly  with  row  houses,  so  that  apartments  are  scarce. 

12.  These  figures  underestimate  the  mobility  somewhat,  for  they  in-

clude only couples married for  three years or more: 

13.  Most  people  wanted  both  ownership  and  a  free-stlmding  house, 
but the desire  for  ownership was  stated more freq\iently  than de-
sire  for  the  single-family  house,  even  among  previ61.1s  apartment 
dwellers.  Of  course,  at  the  end  of  the  1950s,  suburban- bt1ilders 
were  not yet offering "town houses,"  and I did not ask Levittown-
ers  how important the single-family house was  to  them.  However, 
43  per cent checked as  one of  their reasons  for  moving  the  desire 
for more privacy, by which they presumably meant a free-standing 
house. 

14.  These  were  also  mentioned most  often  as  second  and  third  most 

important reasons. 

15.  The  conception  of  push  and  pull  factors  in  residential  choice 
comes  from  Rossi.  His  study,  like  subsequent  ones  of  residential 
mobility,  also  showed  that  space  needs  were  most  important  in 
moving decisions. 

16.  A  1956 study of Levittown, Long Island, reported that 41  per cent 
gave  as  their  first  reason  for  coming,  "the  best  house  for  the 
money."  See  Citizens  Committee  for  a  Better  Levittown. 

17.  Eighteen  per cent  of  the  women  said  they  were  "more  in  favor" 
of  buying  in  Levittown  than  the  men,  42  per  cent  of  men  said 
that they were more in favor, and 40 per cent indicated agreement. 
18.  The figures  vary, depending on the model purchased, and include 
the  cost  of  heating  (which  came  to  about  .Jsoo  a  year)  but  not 
other utilities. 

The  Levittowners-and  Why  They  Came 
19.  After about  three  years'  residence  in  Levittown,  Long  Island,  50 
per cent of the homeowners considered  themselves permanent res-
idents;  17  per cent,  temporary;  and  a  third  were  undecided.  See 
Liell  (1952),  p.  267.  In  a  new  working  class  suburb,  84  per  cent 
of  the  semiskilled  and  a  third  of  the  foremen  saw  themselves  as 
permanent residents,  Berger (1g6o),  p.  20.

findings  about suburban  movers  and  moving  reasons  in  the  To-
ronto  area. 

23.  Interestingly enough,  the  least  educated  and  blue  collar  workers 
had thought more about their future  than  the  well educated  and 
the  professionals,  although other studies  usually describe  them as 
less  able and willing to  think ahead.  The probable reason  is  that 
the  former,  moving  into  what  they  could  expect  to  be  a  middle 
class  community,  would  have  to  make  more  adjustments  than 
other  purchasers,  as  would  the  Settlers  and  those  most  eager  to 
leave  the  city,  who  were  also  most  "future-oriented." 

24.  By  low 11tatus,  I  mean  people lowest  both in educational and  oc· 
cupationallevel, i.e.  blue collar workers and people without high 
school  diplomas.  I  shall  use  the  terms  low  or  lowest  status  here-
after when statistical findings are similar for both blue collar and 
high school dropouts. It should be noted,  however,  that I  did not 
develop  a  single  class  index,  and when  I  use  these  terms;  I  mean 
not  blue  collar  people  without  high  school  diplomas  but  blue 
collar  and  diplomaless  ones  analyzed separately. 

25.  Even  so,  as  the second most  important aspiration volunteered  by 
the  respondents,  the  house,  home,  family,  and  friendship  goals 
turned up as  often as  in the first.

THE  FIRST  LEVITfOWNERS  OCCUPIED  THEIR  HOMES  IN  THE  SECOND 
week  of  October  1958.  Awaiting  them  was  a  township  govern-
ment  which  in  the  past  had  only  to  maintain  the  roads,  and  a 
school  system  which  in  the  previous  year  taught  85  pupils  in 
grades  1  through  9·  The  township  also  boasted  a  Methodist 
church with attached social  organizations,  a  YMCA with  its own 
(but  ramshackle)  building,  a  PTA  for  the  local  school,  and  a 
Levittown Civic  Association,  founded  the year  before  to prepare 
for  the  newcomers  and  to  integrate  them  into  the  existing  com-
munity.  Township  and  county  residents,  most  of  whom  were 
Protestants,  were  eyeing  the  new community with some  trepida-
tion,  because  rumors  had  it  that  many  of  the  newcomers  were 
Catholics leaving Philadelphia slums to escape Negroes, and some 
were  Italians  who  carried  knives.  Elected  officials  were  equally 
fearful,  for  the township and the county had always been Repub-
lican,  and  most  Levittowners  were  expected  to  be  Democrats. 
Even  so,  everyone  was  waiting  to  welcome,  and  if  possible  to 
coopt,  the  25  families  who  moved in  that  October week  and  the 
3000 others who  followed  them  during the  course  of  this  study. 
Among  the  Levittowners  themselves,  the  first  signs  of  group 
life  began  to  appear  even  before  they  moved  in.  As  they  in-
spected  the  model  homes,  many  were  also  inspecting  the  other 
,people who were looking at the homes with them. Those who de-
,cided  to  buy were  called  back  to  Levittown a  few  weeks  later to 

•  44  • 

The  Beginnings  of  Group  Life 

•  45  • 

select their lots, and at that time some met the people who would 
live near them.  Most did not, but even so,  they were ready  to as-
sume  that  they  would  be agreeable  neighbors  and  perhaps  even 
good  friends.  Later,  only  g  per cent  recalled  being  "very  much 
concerned about not knowing [their] neighbors beforehand." Re-
assured  by  the  people  they  had  seen  around  the  model  homes 
area and by  the  builder's credit check,  they felt,  as  one man  put 
it, "the people who could afford this type of house would be good 
people."  Besides,  everyone was  looking forward  to occupying his 
new home, and this engendered a spirit of optimism and the trust 
that  other  purchasers  shared  this  spirit.  After  all,  Levittown 
would be a new community, and newness is  often identified with 
perfection  in American culture. 

Before moving in,  only a  few  people were  looking forward  to 
getting  together  with  their  neighbors,  at  least  according  to  the 
mail  qllf.lstionnaire results.  However, once  they had occupied  the 
house  and  had  gotten  it  and  themselves  settled,  they  began  to 
look  for  playmates  for  their  young  children  and  then  to  find 
companions  for  themselves  among  their  new  neighbors.  For  the 
first  two weeks they worked mainly at getting the house  in shape, 
limiting  themselves  to  exchanging  cheerful  hellos  across  the 
street or backyard.  Once the initial nest-making period was  over, 
however, people were ready to meet and,  in this process,  they got 
some help from an unexpected source-salesmen. 

On moving day  the  first  people  to greet  the  new  homeowners 
had  not  been  their neighbors  but  an  unending  parade  of  milk-
men,  bread  salesmen,  and other merchants hoping  to  sign  them 
up for  home  delivery  until  the .shopping center was  completed. 
At first,  the constant callers were a  bother, but when the moving-
in  chores  were  over, .the  salesmen  became  social  intermediaries, 
telling  people about  their  neighbors,  and  pointing out the ones 
with similar backgrounds or interests.  Children,  too,  were a  cata-
lyst.  They were  let out of  the house  at once  to  allow  mothers  to 
get  the  house  settled,  and  immediately  began  to  find  age  mates 
on  the  block.  This  brought  parents  of  roughly  similar  age  to-
gether.  Where such  playmates  were  not available,  or  if  the  chil-
dren  were  too  young,  mothers  would  take  them  in  hand  and 
knock  on a  few  doors  to find  out if children of similar age  were 
nearby. The women  then had an excuse  to  meet their neighbors. 
The  speed  with  which  people  met  depended  in  part  on  the 
season.  VJ"inter  arrivals could not get out of the house  much and 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

in some cases  had to wait until spring,  being lonely in the mean-
time.  But the initial section was  occupied when  the weather was 
still  warm,  and  the  very  first  Levittowners  came  together  quite 
quickly.  Bad  weather  does  not  prevent  socializing;  it  is,  rather, 
that  most  people  need  an  excuse  to  meet  each  other.  The  in-
trepid and extrovert few can go up and introduce themselves, but 
for most people such a  frontal  assault,  with its  tacit admission of 
loneliness and  the possibility of  being rejected,  is  impossible.  In 
good weather,  however,  opportunities and excuses were at hand. 
One could  take  the children outside, and spend some  time with 
them until a  neighbor appeared, or one could work on the lawn 
for  the same covert· purpose. If these methods did not work, peo-
ple could-and did-walk up and down  the street with baby car-
riages  or tricycling children as  a  way  of extending  the exchange 
of hellos to a meeting. Since everyone was dying of curiosity, such 
excuses were acceptable forms of breaking the isolation._ 

The feeling of optimism that neighbors would be friendly was 
not  enough;  there  had  to  be some  sign  that  there  would  be  no 
rejection. Women asked, "Are you settled yet?" If the answer was 
positive,  then  invitations  could  be  exchanged  to  look  at  each 
others'  houses.  Being  settled  meant  that  the  house  was  in  suffi-
cient shape to express the image that the women wanted to create 
among  their  neighbors.  The  men,  knowing  that  they would  be 
less  dependent  on  their  neighbors  for  social  activities,  could  be 
more casual,  although  they did  help their wives,  working on  the 
front  lawn  to  make  sure  that  the  image  outside  was  as  good  as 
that inside. 

Once the image was ready, and an initial meeting produced no 
rejection,  people were  prepared  to  exchange  information  and  to 
look for common backgrounds or interests that would bind them 
together.  They described where they had come from, and their-
or  their  husbands'--occupations,  and  went  on  to  cover  child-
rearing  methods  and  plans  for  fixing  the  house  (women),  the 
lawn,  cars,  and  work  (men).  Every  topic  served  either  to  bring 
people closer together or to pull them apart, by indicating where 
differences existed and what topics were taboo.  For example, one 
of my neighbors was an Army pilot, and on our initial meeting-
produced  by  a  washout  on  our  front  lawn~we exchanged  oc-
cupations.  After I  mentioned being a  professor,  he made a  crack 
about another neighbor, a blue collar worker, to indicate that, al-
though he referred to himself as "a glorified truck driver" he was, 

The  Beginnings  of  Group  Life 

•  47  • 

nevertheless, a  white collar worker like me.  He went on by talk-
ing about a  relative  who  was  studying for  his  Ph.D.,  but,  aware 
that  most  professors  were  liberal  and  agnostic,  he  also  let  me 
know  that  he  shared  Southern  race  attitudes  and  was  a  funda-
mentalist  Baptist.  Disagreements  would  surely  come  up  about 
race and religion, and if we were to be good neighbors, these sub-
jects should not be discussed. 

After  the  first  bits  of  personal  and  family  information  had 
been  exchanged,  adjacent  neighbors  traded  invitations  to  come 
in for coffee.  H a  social  entrepreneur had  moved onto  the  block, 
there might even be a  block party, but as  a  rule, large gatherings 
needed another rationale so as  to leave enough social distance be-
tween  potentially  incompatible  people.  One  such  device  was  a 
card party; another was a party at which a  national manufacturer 
of plasticware or small appliances exhibited and sold  his products 
to  a  group  of  invited  women.  Although  the  hostess  of  such  a 
party might appear to trade on her social  contacts in order to ob-
tain material benefit-she received free  products for  holding the 
gathering-it was never interpreted in this fashion.  "It gives me a 
chance to meet people I've wanted to meet," one such hostess ex-
plained. "It's just not right to go up to someone  to say  I  want to 
meet  you;  that  you  only  do ,with  next-door  neighbors.  I'm  not 
out  to  make  money;  it's  just  an  excuse  for  partying."  On  the 
blocks that settled later,  people got together after attending com-
munity-wide meetings or were introduced  to  each other through 
the charity fund drives. These were usually run by  women expe-
rienced  in  community activity  or  by  those  who could  knock  on 
doors without  trepidation,  but even  for  the  less  courageous, col-
lecting for the heart or cancer fund was an entree and, of course, 
a  chance  to  meet  the  neighbors.  Finally,  such  holidays  as  the 
Fourth  of  July,  Halloween,  and  Christmas  allowed  neighbors 
moving in just before then to throw a  party without seeming too 
bold socially. 

All of these occasions were structured to make overtures as suc-
cessful  as  possible.  Initial  rejection  was,  of course,  rare,  for  no 
one could be curt to a neighbor who would be living on the same 
block for several  years. Too much social aggressiveness was out of 
the  question,  however,  for  most  Levittowners  were  uncomfort-
able with "forward" people. 

First encounters took anywhere from  two weeks  to a  month or 
two;  they  were  followed  by  a  period  of  considerable  informal 

•  4B  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

visiting  and  entertammg,  lasting  perhaps  two  to  six  months. 
These visits  provided companionship and mutual support in the 
early period of living in a  new community,  for a  new  house  in a 
still  almost  rural  area  created  not  only  loneliness  but  also  a 
variety  of  problems  which  were  solved  by  getting  together  and 
"sharing ideas." 

Each  contact  between  neighbors  could  advance  people  closer 
to  friendship,  or it could  bring out  differences  that would  indi-
cate that friendship was not possible.  Both alternatives developed 
quickly.  On  one  block  a  group  of  women  had  established  a 
bridge club a month after arrival;  on another, four women  had a 
daily coffee-klatsch  after about  two  months.  On  my  block  all  of 
this happened so  precipitously that by mid-December, one neigh-
bor  could  say,  "I  feel  I  have  been  in  Levittown  for  years,  the 
place is so settled." 

The culture of the block jelled quite rapidly too.  Standards of 
lawn  care  were  agreed  upon  as  soon  as  it  was  time  to  do  some-
thing  about  the  lawn,  and  by  unspoken  agreement,  the  front 
lawn would be cared for conscientiously, but the backyard was  o£ 
less importance. Those who deviated from  this norm-either neg-
lecting  their  lawn  or  working  on  it  too  industriously-were 
brought into line through wisecracks.  When I,  in a  burst of com-
pulsive concern, worked very hard on my lawn at the start, one of 
my neighbors laughed and said he would have to move out if I was 
going to have  "that fancy a  lawn." Since  I was  not interested  in a 
"fancy  lawn,"  I  found  it  easy  to  take  the  hint,  but  those  who 
wanted a  perfect lawn stayed away from  the talkfests that usually 
developed  evenings  and  on  Saturday  mornings  when  the  men 
were ostensibly working on the lawns, so as not to be joked about 
and chastised as ratebusters. 

Perhaps  the  best  illustration  of  the  rapid  definition  of  block 
norms  came  at  a  party  around  Christmas  time.  A  former  New 
York suburbanite  invited  everyone  to  a  stand-up  cocktail  party, 
but  within  an  hour  it  had  turned  into  an  informal  gathering, 
climaxed by a  slightly drunken  group sing.  The almost  immedi-
ate  transformation  from  an  upper middle  class  party  to  a  lower 
middle class  get-together  took  place  for  several  reasons.  Most  of 
the  guests  were  unfamiliar  with  cocktail  parties  and  were  not 
willing  to  stand  up  in  the  prescribed  fashion.  The  hostess  was 
dressed  up  in  bright  Capri  pants,  but  one  of  the  neighbors,  of 
working class  background,  had  never seen such  pants, and  think-

The  Beginnings  of  Group  Life 

•  49  • 

ing they  were  pajamas,  concluded  the  party had  been called off. 
Only when  guests  started  arriving did  she  realize  her  error  and 
later everyone,  she  included,  laughed about it.  The hostess'  hus-
band  had  objected  to  what  he  called  a  "Westchester  County 
party"  from  the  start,  and  the  hostess  went  along with  the  dra-
matic metamorphosis  too.  She had not been  putting on airs,  but 
had  thought  her  neighbors  were  like  those  in  New  York.  From 
then on, social  life on the block followed  the norms of lower mid-
dle class entertaining. 

Informal  Clubs 

As  people decided how they  felt  about their nearby neighbors, 
a  sorting  and  departure  process  developed.  Those  who  had  be-
come friends  set up  block cliques,  others moved  into multiblock 
ones, and yet others looked for friends  elsewhere, particularly for 
evening visiting.  The earliest departures  took  place  among social 
and cultural minority groups, especially working and upper mid-
dle  class  people,  older  ones,  and  Jews--and  all  others  who  felt 
themselves  out  of  place  among  their  neighbors  and  needed  or 
wanted  to  find  their  social  life  elsewhere.  With  this  departure, 
the community stratification process began in earnest.1 

Many  of  the  Jewish  women  had  come  from  predominantly 
Jewish areas in the cities and for a significant number, Levittown 
was  the  first  real  contact with non-Jewish  neighbors.  Some  made 
friends,  but many were not comfortable enough and began quite 
early  to  search  for  other Jewish  women.  The  salesmen  helped, 
but the  process  was  immeasurably hastened  by an unpredictable 
factor.  One of the ministers who was  forming a  church  had long 
admired the Jews.  As  he made  the rounds looking for  people  for 
his church, he ran into a Jewish couple who mentioned the need 
for  a  synagogue  in  Levittown,  and  thereafter  he  passed  on  the 
names  of  all  Jews  he  encountered.  As  a  result,  only  five  weeks 
after  the  first  Levittowners  had  arrived,  the  twenty-six  Jewish 
families among them met to discuss the formation of a synagogue. 
The  meeting  acquainted  Jews  with  each  other,  and  the  first 
Levittown  organization  was  set  up a  few  days  later-a mahjong 
club  for  Jewish  women.  It was  not  really  a  formal  club,  but by 
this time the county daily newspaper had added a society column, 
and  the society  editor was  so  short of news  that  she  pounced on 
any grouping and promptly dubbed it a club. 

Another sorting process occurred among a group of women on a 

•  50  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNEilS 

block adjacent to mine. Although people chose their lots individ-
ually, the high proportion of Catholics brought it about that four 
women  of  that  religion,  all  of  them  from  working  class  back-
grounds,  lived  close  to  each  other.  Since  they  differed  from  the 
evolving block culture,  they began  to  meet every day for  lengthy 
coffee-klatsches,  partly  in  common  defense  against  the  middle 
class ethos.  In fact  coffee-klatsch cliques sprang up all  over Levit-
town,  although  not  half as  many  as  the  suburban myth  claimed 
or as  I  had expected.  Women  not of a  minority culture took  oc-
casional  coffee  with  their  neighbors,  but  they  did  not  need  to 
huddle together as closely. 

Some  of  the  coffee-klatsch  groups  expanded  into  block  clubs, 
involving a  dozen  neighbors on adjacent blocks, which  met fort-
nightly or monthly  for  conversation  andjor cards,  with  individ-
ual  members getting together in between.  Some were  formed  by 
enterprising women  who  had belonged  to similar clubs  in  other 
suburbs,  but most  developed  among people with minority back-
grounds  or interests.  They usually  evolved  after  the summer,  as 
block  sociability  waned  and  women  wanted  to  make  sure  that 
they  would  see  each  other  in  winter,  when  people  who  do  not 
visit each other regularly have little opportunity to meet. On one 
block,  it  was  a  group  of  older  women;  on  another,  a  group  of 
women interested in civic activities or in politics; on yet another, 
a  group  of  wives  with  traveling  husbands-salesmen,  pilots,  or 
merchant seamen.  Elsewhere,  it was  a  group  of  Catholic  women 
whose  men  had  become  involved  in  the  organization  of  the 
Catholic  parish and had told their wives,  "You'd better get busy 
if  you  want  companionship."  Indeed,  the  clubs  were  often 
formed  by  women  whose  husbands  were  away  from  the  house  a 
lot.  Most clubs were strictly female,  although sometimes the men 
later formed  card-playing clubs.  One  informal  group,  called  the 
Happy  Hours club,  consisted  of  previously urban and  primarily 
Italian  couples  who  liked  to  stay  up  late  and  complained  that 
their neighbors went to bed at  10 P.M. every nig~t. 

Most  of  the  groups  remained  together  for  at  least  the  three 
years  that  I  was  in  touch  with  them.  Some  had  become  regular 
clubs when the group lost its initial enthusiasm and structure was 
needed as  an adhesive.  Sometimes,  the organization was  involun-
tary,  as  when  the  society reporter from  the county daily wanted 
to write about them and asked them to take a name and become a 
club.  Usually,  the women did not want publicity, partly because 

• sz  • 
The  Beginnings  of  Group  Life 
neighbors  who  had  not  been  invited  to  join  would  feel  ex-
cluded. 

Other  minority  group  members  had  a  more  difficult  time  in 
finding friends  close  by and  had  to enter the  larger community. 
Among  these  were  professional  and  upper  middle  class  people 
and,  especially,  college-educated  women.  They  felt  isolated  on 
the blocks, and of course their dissatisfaction separated them fur-
ther  from  the  neighbors.  Their  feeling  of  estrangement  in  the 
pervasive  lower  middle  class  culture  encouraged  them  to  estab-
lish  community-wide  voluntary  associations  which  could  attract 
other Levittowners with similar social  and cultural  interests. 

The Evolution of Social Life 

The  development  of  social  relationships  reached  an  equilib-
rium  rapidly,  for  75  per  cent  of  the  interview  respondents  re-
ported having settled down both in the house and in the commu-
nity within six months,  and fully  half indicated  it took  even less 
time  than  that.  After  two  years  in  Levittown,  47  per  cent  re-
ported  that  they  were  doing  about  as  much  individual  visiting 
with neighbors as  they had after six months;  30 per cent said they 
were  doing  more.  Nighttime  visiting  with  other  couples  in-
creased, 43  per cent reporting more,  34  per cent about the same, 
and the rest,  less.  About a  third indicated the couples  they spent 
most of their time with  were  neighbors,  while  24  per cent men-
tioned  people  they  met in community organizations, and  13  per 
cent,  those  met at church.  Only  20  per cent indicated  that  none 
of their friends  were  neighbors.  The people who did more visit-
ing  with  other  couples  than  after  arrival  also  said  they  visited 
with  neighbors more,  and vice  versa.  About a  quarter of  the re-
spondents reported less  visiting with couples and neighbors  than 
before, however, and these respondents were primarily low-status 
people  with  less  than  a  high  school  education,  and  with  blue 
collar jobs. 

Over time,  the  block social  system  had stabilized as  well, rang-
ing from  close friendship among some  to open hostility among a 
few,  but  mostly  calling  for  friendly  coexistence  and  occasional 
visiting  among  those  who  were  not  friends.  Holiday  parties  in-
creased cohesion  temporarily, and if an accident or illness  befell 
a  neighbor everyone  pitched  in to help as  much as  he could, re-
gardless of how people felt about the family. 

The prevailing equilibrium was  most often interrupted by two 

•  52  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

phenomena:  the  turnover  of  residents  and  fights  among  neigh-
bors.  The  latter  were  not  frequent,  but  when  they  happened, 
they could produce lasting feuds.  Most  squabbles generated over 
the  children.  If children  quarrel-and  they  often  do-parents 
naturally  take  sides.  If one  set  of  parents  feels  that  the  other 
child  is  in  the  wrong  and  has  not  been  sufficiently  punished  or 
that  his  wrongdoing  is  a  result  of  what  it  considers  poor  pa-
rental  supervision,  the children's conflict  is  likely to  become one 
between parents. This may continue long after the children have 
forgotten  the fight.  Parental conflicts,  of course, expressed deeper 
disagreements between neighbors;  friends do not fight  over their 
children's  battles.  Sometimes  there  was  an  eventual  reconcilia-
tion,  but often  people  just stopped  talking  to  each  other. 

Turnover was  then  slight  and stemmed  largely  from  transfers 
by employers, but if the relationship with neighbors had been in-
tense,  the family who  took over the house was  not invited to join 
the group. If ties were  less close and the newcomer amicable and 
of similar age and background, she was  usually welcomed. As  one 
pointed out, "I had to push a little at first  to get people to talk  to 
me,  but  now  there's  no  problem.  There  isn't  much  coffee-
klatsching here,  we  are all  too  busy  cleaning.  But  I'm pregnant, 
and  the  gal  next  door  just  had  a  baby  too,  so  that  made  for  a 
common interest." 

The arrival of a baby was always an event in Levittown-where 
it was  an everyday occurrence-and there was  likely to be a  baby 
shower and renewed interest in the mother among the neighbors. 
A  first  pregnancy  also  incorporated  old-time  residents  into  the 
block  society.  One  of  my  neighbors  had  worked  prior  to  her 
pregnancy,  and  had  not  been around for  the weekday  exchange 
of coffee  visits.  When  the  baby came,  she  was  at once  visited  by 
another  neighbor,  also  pregnant,  and  then  became  part  of  the 
block,  even  though  it had  been  two  years  since  they  had  all  ar-
rived. 

THE FOUNDING OF VOLUNTARY  ASSOCIATIONS 

In  a  new  community,  organizations  can  be  started  by  outsiders 
or by residents,  that is, by external or internal initiative. The res-
idents  can  act  intentionally  to  achieve  community  aspirations 
held  before  arrival,  or  unintentionally,  responding  to  commu-
nity conditions of  the  moment.  This suggests  three  types  of ori-

gin:  External,  Internal-Intended,  and  Internal-Unintended. 2 
For simplicity's sake,  I  will  call  the first  External,  the  second In-
ternal, and the third Unintended. 

In  Levittown, almost a  third  of all  organizations set  up in the 
first two years were External. These were usually branches of na-
tionwide  associations,  especially  service  clubs,  veterans'  groups, 
and  women's  social  clubs.  Since  Levittown's  opening  had  been 
widely  heralded  for  some  time,  and  a  community  of  12,ooo  or 
more  families  were  expected,  the  associations  saw  a  golden  op-
portunity to expand their roster of branches and members. Some 
used  professional  organizers  who  go  from  community  to  com-
munity,  but  most  asked  or  encouraged  branches  in  nearby 
towns  to  organize  their  new  neighbor.  Many  associations  give 
annual  awards  to  the  local  branches  which  set  up  the  most  new 
groups  and  enroll  the  most  new  members,  and  the  winners  ob-
tain  increased  political  strength  within  the  national  association. 
Indeed, a man who wants to be a national or state officer  in a  ser-
vice  or veterans'  club  is  materially aided  in  his  rise  up  the  hier-
archy  by  getting  a  reputation  as  a  "starter."  This  incentive  ex-
tends  to professional  organizers as  well.  Almost  two  years  before 
Levittown  opened,  national  Boy  Scouts  headquarters  had  re-
quested the county office  to start tooling up for forming troops in 
Levittown.  A  young executive was  added  to  the county staff;  he 
had taken a  pay cut to come,  knowing full  well  that he  would be 
able  to  organize many troops,  thereby  enhancing his  chances  for 
rapid career advancement in the future. 

Most  organizations  waited  until  the  community  was  settled, 
but  then  went  into  action  quickly  in  the  hope  of  bringing  the 
potential leaders and active participants among the Levittowners 
into their group before others had a  chance  to attract them.  As  a 
result,  the  Veterans  of  Foreign  Wars  (VFW)  arrived  on  the 
scene  after  only  three  months,  when  Levittown  had  barely  two 
hundred families,  and the Lions,  Kiwanis, and the Junior Cham-
ber of Commerce  followed  shortly afterwards.  Later,  O.R.T.  (a 
Jewish women's service  organization),  4-H,  a  B'nai  B'rith  Lodge 
for  men,  a  county  hospital  auxiliary,  a  civil  defense  group,  the 
Optimists  (a  men's  service  club),  B'rith  Sholom  (a  Jewish  fra-
ternity),  and  the  American  Legion  were  founded  in  a· similar 
manner. 

The Internal  method  of organization  was  used  principally  by 
women~s groups, with a  Levittowner who had been active  in  the

group in the past and had intended to start a  new branch doing 
so  as  soon ·as enough  potential  members seemed  to  be available. 
The  founders'  motives  varied.  Some  were  looking  for  advance-
ment in the national  organizational  hierarchy;  others wanted  to 
be the first  president of the new group;  but for most,  the organi-
zation  had  become integral  to  their lives.  A  founder of a  Jewish 
women's  group explained  her  initiative  by saying,  "I could  not 
conceive  of  living  without  Hadassah."  Among  other  groups 
founded  in  this  fashion  were  Deborah_,  a  woman's  organization 
supporting a  national  tuberculosis hospital, a  B'nai B'rith Lodge 
for women,  the Federated Women's Club, the League of Women 
Voters,  and  Beta  Sigma  Phi,  a  sorority  for  women  without  col-
lege degrees. 

Externally and  Internally founded  organizations were  usually 
national branches,  but sometimes people who had been active  in 
local  groups  in  their  former  communities came  with  the  inten-
tion of starting one  in Levittown.  A  Texan  imported  the  Lords 
and  Ladie~ Club,  which  held  monthly  dances  at  county supper 
clubs  for  middle  class  managerial  families  who  wanted  but 
could  not  afford  a  country  club.  The  Emergency  Ambulance 
Squad was  initiated by a  man who had been an officer  of one  in 
his previous community. 

Most  local  groups  were  Unintended,  founded  in  response  to 
some  felt  community  or  individual  need.  Usually  people  with 
similar  interests  came  together,  sometimes  accidentally,  some-
times  because  they  were  a  minority  which  needed  to  be  to-
gether,  and sometimes  because  they  could gain  from  formal  or-
ganization.  Several  ham  radio  operators  met  by  sheer  accident, 
having heard  each  other over  the  air.  A  Ham  Club  was  started 
when it became  possible  to obtain civil  defense funds  to convert 
their hobby into a  community service. 

On the other hand, a  number of Unintended groups arose be-
cause  members  individually  could  not  do  without  them,  par-
ticularly women who were  lonely and could not find  compatible 
neighbors.  One  woman  turned  to  the  national  office  of  Pan-
Hellenic,  a  sorority  for  college  graduates  to which  she  had once 
belonged.  Her decision  to  form  a  branch  was  primarily a  func-
tion of class  difference;  she  found  herself uninterested  in block-
club  card games  and  gossip.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Levittown 
Women's  Club,  a  branch  of  the  Federated  Women's  Clubs  of 
America,  was  founded  without  premeditation  by  a  lonely  resi-

The  Beginnings  of  Group  Life

dent who had been active  in a  branch elsewhere  and had  simply 
enjoyed  her  membership.  In  many  cases,  wives  whose  husbands 
were frequently out of town  became  Unintended  founders.  The 
organizer  of  the  ·women's  Club  and  the  two  neighbors  with 
whom  she  worked  were  married  to  salesmen  or  pilots.  Subse-
quently,  women  whose  traveling  husbands  worked  in  the  same 
firm or line also started groups.  For instance, the local  newspaper 
reported  of  the  "RCA Wives"  that  "from  the  first  meethtg  it is 
evident  that a  lot  of  the wives  whose  husbands are away a  great 
deal are more than eager to constructively fill  their time." 8  Simi· 
Jar  clubs  were  organized  by  the  wives  of  merchant  seamen  and 
Air Force pilots. 

In  other  cases,  the  impetus  was  culturally  based.  An  All-
Nations  club  of foreign  wives,  and  before  that  a  British  Wives 
club, were organized, as were a  dramatic society, a ceramics club, 
a  folk  dance  group,  an  art  club,  and  branches  of  two  national 
groups,  the Great Books Club and the Buxom Belles  (devoted  to 
group  weight  reduction).  In  two  neighborhoods  the  scarcity  of 
baby-sitters  encouraged  the  formation  of  cooperatives  in  which 
women exchanged baby-sitting services for each other. They were 
popular  with  Jewish  women  who  wanted  to  get  out  for  club 
meetings  but  whose  husbands  worked  evenings  in  stores  in  the 
Philadelphia area. 

Community  needs  and  issues  generated  a  number  of  sponta· 
neous  civic  and  political  groups.  Dissatisfaction  with  Board  of 
Education  policies  brought  about  the  Citizens'  Association  for 
Public  Schools;  the  Levittown  Youth  Sports  Association  was 
founded  by  the  police  chief  in  the  hope  of  keeping  adolescents 
busy  to  prevent  juvenile  delinquency;  and  doctors  organized  a 
professional  group  to  protect  themselves  against  the  osteopaths 
who outnumbered them in the area. 

As  the community  matured,  a  number of  Unintended groups 
arose  in opposition  to already established ones.  A  Jewish  frater-
nity sprang up because men wanting social  activities were dissat-
isfied with the existing Jewish men's club, primarily dedicated to 
fund  raising for  the  synagogue,  and  civic  associations  developed 
in the later neighborhoods to defend their interests before elected 
officials who came largely from the initially settled areas.  The ser-
vice and veterans'  groups stimulated women's auxiliaries,  gener-
ally  Externally,  but  sometimes  on an  Unintended  basis  because 
the wives wanted to help their husbands, and share a common or· 

•  s6  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

ganizational affiliation.  Unintended groups also  sprang up in the 
later neighborhoods because  the residents  were unwilling to join 
groups formed  by residents from  the  initial  neighborhoods,  feel-
ing they would not be  welcome by the older residents, or because 
they  thought  they  had  more  in  common  with  people  who  had 
moved  in at the same  time.  Besides,  an ambitious founder could 
organize a new group more easily than enter an established group 
and work his way up. 

The Organizational  Process 

Anyone  can  start  an  organization,  but it  can  only  survive  by 
attracting members,  and for  this  reason  the  organizational  proc-
ess  was  often  the  same.  The  first  step  was,  of  course,  to  get  in 
touch with potential members.  National organizations used  mail-
ing lists  to  find  members  who  had  just  moved  to  Levittown  or 
had  the  school  send  invitations  home  via  the  students.  There 
were  newspaper ads  and stories and announcements  at  meetings 
of other organizations.  But perhaps most successful  was  the prac-
tice  of  enrolling  friends  and  neighbors.  People  who  wanted  to 
start an organization often called on  their neighbors for help,  ex-
ploiting  the  cohesion  developed  on  the  block;  people  curious 
enough  to come  to  a  first  meeting  brought  a  neighbor  for  com-
pany  and  security.  Later  interviews  showed  that  of  the  people 
who had not intended to join groups,  fully  36  per cent had been 
drawn  in  by  neighbors. 4  This  banding  together  affected  the  or-
ganizational process in two ways.  Founders who called on friends 
to  help  them  quickly  developed  leadership  cliques.  This  often 
speeded up the organizing process, but in some cases it led to pro-
tests that the group was run by a clique, and then to rival cliques. 
It also  made  many groups  into virtual  neighborhood clubs,  and 
discouraged  joiners from  other  neighborhoods.  Thus,  new  clubs 
with the same manifest aim, such as  service clubs, appeared when 
new neighborhoods were settled because the previously organized 
clubs were in effect exclusive. 

These  consequences  were  quite  unintended,  for  all  groups 
were open  to any person  wanting to join.  Even  those which  had 
membership  requirements-for example,  service  clubs which  in 
other towns  took only men in retail  business--opened their rolls 
to  anyone  who  was  interested.  The opportunity .to  be a  charter 
member-or an officer-was publicized to get people into the  or-
ganization  and  to  establish  it  as  quickly  as  possible  on  a  firm 

The  Beginnings  of  Group  Life

basis.  The next step was  the election of officers and development 
of program.  Both stages  also  proceeded with great haste  in order 
to secure  the existence of the organization as  quickly as  possible. 
Once the group was  chartered,  the  program  could be used  to  at-
tract further members,  making available  more people and funds 
to recruit others, expand the organization, and thus guarantee its 
survival. Officers were usually elected at either the first  or second 
meeting,  often  before  people  had  a  chance  to  get  acquainted. 
Ambitious leaders could generally get themselves elected and put 
their friends  into office  as  well,  although occasionally attendance 
was  so  small  that  everyone  present  became  an  officer  willy-nilly. 
Most  of  the  time,  the  wish  to  get  the  group  organized  and 
chartered  immediately preempted  the selection  of the right  peo-
ple for the position. For example, one founder had persuaded the 
newspaper  to  run  a  picture  of  the  elected  officers,  and  the  elec-
tion had to be hurried so that a  slate of officers could pose for the 
photographer  when  he  came.  Another  meeting  was  thrown  into 
an  uproar  by  one  Levittowner  who  argued  that  the  norms  of 
democracy demanded the postponement of elections until people 
knew  the  candidates  and  each  other,  but  those  in  attendance 
wanted  the  organization,  a  neighborhood  PTA,  established  that 
night,  and voted  to  elect  a  slate  nominated  by  the  founder  and 
her friends. 

The  Definitional  Struggle 

The rapidity  of  the  organizing  process  created  a  considerable 
amount  of conflict  in  many  organizations.  These  conflicts  were 
usually ascribed to "personalities", reflecting the inability of peo-
ple to get along. Some were generated by the newness of the com-
munity,  for,  as  one  leader  put  it,  "When  you  don't  know  each 
other, it is hard to separate the workers from  the talkers." 5  More 
often,  the  fights  between  personalities were  actually  definitional 
struggles  about  the  purpose,  composition,  and  program  of  the 
group,  especially  in  organizations  without  nationally  prescribed 
activities.  Probably  the most  important source of differences was 
class.  For  example,  the  VFW,  the  first  male  organization  in 
Levittown,  initially  attracted  both  working  class  and  a  smaller 
number  of  middle  class  people.  From  the  start,  working  class 
members  wanted  a  primarily  social  organization;  the  middle 
class,  a  community  service  group.  The  confrontation  was  rela-
tively  brief,  however;  after a  few  weeks,  the  middle class  leaders 

•  sB  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

left  to organize  the Catholic church. Where such alternative out-
lets  were  not  available,  factions  and  bitter  struggles  developed 
over the election of the second year's set of officers. 

In  one  women's  club,  the  definitional  strug~le was  over  the 
amount  of  innovation  permissible  in  club  tradition.  This  in-
volved  differences  of  age  and  of  class.  The  traditionalists,  who 
were  somewhat  older and  more  restrictively  lower  middle  class, 
wanted  a  closed  group  with  a  statusful  program  of  "culture"; 
the  innovators,  more  expansive,  called  for  open  admission 
and  a  program  of  "community  service."  The  crucial  but  never 
stated issue was  over the admission  of working class  women;  this 
came out when the leader of the traditional faction described her 
opponent as  wanting to run the club as  if  it were-a  firehouse-a 
historical  preserve for  the working class.6  The adherents of open 
admission won, and the leader of the traditionalists retired to set 
up an art club, while the victorious advocate  of community serv-
ice  later  went  into  politics. 

There was  also constant debate over  the speed of organization, 
with  "go-slow"  factions  who wanted  the  group  to  establish  itsel£ 
firmly  before  it  indulged  in  too  many  activities,  and  "go-fast" 
ones  which  argued-usually successfully-that  a  rapid  pace  was 
needed to advertise the organization in order to enroll new mem-
bers.  A  similar  conflict  was  noticeable  in  leadership  struggles. 
Founders were  often  dynamic  and even  charismatic  people  who 
attracted  publicity and  thus  members,  but  then  tended  to order 
the  more  active  ones  around  and  alienated  them.  Whether 
praised  as  "starters"  or  discredited  as  "pushers,"  they  would 
eventually  be  replaced  by  more  diplomatic  officers,  administra-
tors  who  were  able  to  get  people  to  work  together.  Of  twelve 
officers  who  had  succeeded  founders,  eleven  indicated  that  the 
one thing they were doing differently was  "stabilizing the organi-
zation"  or "delegating authority  to  a  much greater  extent." 7  In 
some  working  class  groups,  the  founder  sometimes  lacked  ad· 
ministrative skills and later gave  way  to  a  better-educated,  lower 
middle  class  member  who  was  more  able  to  run  meetings  and 
manage relations with other groups. 

Most definitional struggles ended with  the acquiescence of the 
losing  faction  and  the  gradual  departure  of  its  members.  Even-
tually,  many  organizations achieved  a  measure  of stability,  both 
in number of members and in programs, with  occasional  innova-
tion  in  activities,  particularly  of  the  community  service  variety 

The  Beginning~ of  Group  Life 
that  would  publicize  the  group  anew.  If membership  lagged, 
there were  likely  to  be periods of organizational revival,  sparked 
by  the appearance of a  new leader whose dynamism and willing-
ness  to work enabled him to move rapidly into the organization's 
ruling  circle.  The  new  arrivals  were  usually  people  who  had 
previously belonged to the organization elsewhere. 

•  59  • 

Not  all  groups  underwent  definitional  struggles,  however.  In 
many national organizations, the leaders had been active in other 
suburbs and other new branches and  thus had a  ready answer  to 
the inevitable first  question:  How should we get started? Indeed, 
almost all  groups  tried  to  find  members with  past  experience  in 
new  (or  old)  groups,  hoping  that  their  "ideas"  would  work  in 
Levittown.  Often  then,  the  young organizations relied  on  tradi· 
tional solutions,  although when definitional  struggles developed, 
the voices  of experience were not respected. 

The  haste  with  which  organizations  sought  to  get  started  is 
shown by the chronological  pattern of founding.  During the first 
nine  months  of Levittown's  existence,  when  the  population  was 
small and most people were still settling into house and block,  14 
groups  sprang  up  (not  counting  churches  and  church-related 
ones), and from  September  1959  to June  1960,  when  the popula· 
tion  enlarged  and  more  people  were  ready  to  look  beyond  the 
block,  36  were  founded.  The  peak  had  already  been  reached, 
however;  only  14  additional  groups  appeared  during  the  1g6o-
1961  season and just  13  more in  the next four years--for a grand 
total  of 77. 8  Only a  handful  of  these  failed  to  survive,  although 
some  have  carried  on  with  just  a  few  members.  When  inter-
viewed  after  two  years,  about 70  per cent of the respondents  re-
ported belonging to  at least  one of  these  organizations. 

Externally founded groups and branches of national ones were 
of course  able  to  mobilize  more  quickly,  and  regardless  of  how 
they were  founded,  those appealing to  ethnic or class  minorities 
were set  up earlier than those  appealing  to  the  dominant  lower 
middle class  population.  Among  the  churches,  for  example,  the 
Jews and the fundamentalist Baptists were the first,  and organiza-
tions  appealing  to  lower-status  groups  preceded  those  of  higher 
status. Among the men's groups, the order was exactly in terms of 
status;  the  VFW arriving first,  followed  shortly thereafter by the 
Lions, Kiwanis, and Junior Chamber of Commerce, with the 0?-
timists and Rotarians waiting until the community was  two years 
old.  Higher-status organizations  can  afford  to  wait  because  they 

•  6o  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

know  that  people  will  join  whenever  they  appear,  and  such 
groups even  bide  their time to see  who  the highest-status leaders 
are.  Low-status  groups  benefit  from  early establishment,  for  this 
gives  them  an  opportunity  to  attract  higher-status  people  who 
want to become active immediately. Among the women's groups, 
lower-status  groups  also  preceded  higher  ones,  although  those 
enrolling  a  large  proportion  of  Jews  came  before  all  others. 
Groups with similar programs and appealing to the same types of 
people organized almost en seriatim so as not to be left behind in 
the competition  for  members. 

lhganizational Origin and Residents' Aapirationa 

If the aspirations  Levittowners volunteered before  arrival  had 
guided  the  founding  process,  most  organizations  would  have 
been started  Internally by people to whom  they were  important. 
Civic  groups  would  have  outnumbered  social  clubs  and  both 
would  have  been  surpassed  by  home-and-family-centered  groups 
such as PT As,  Scouts, and garden clubs. 

As  it  turned  out,  however,  only  24  per  cent  of  the  organiza-
tions  emerging  in  the  first  two  years  were  Internal,  31  per  cent 
were External, and the remaining 45  per cent were  Unintended. 
More were social  than were civic-28 per cent were purely social 
and  cultural;  28  per cent,  mixed social  and  service;  and  16  per 
cent, civic.  Only  14  per cent were family-centered,  although  that 
proportion would triple if churches were considered in this cate-
gory.  (The  rest  included  "occupational"  groups,  such  as  the 
Medical  Club;  an  investment  club,  and,  of  course,  a  garden 
club.) 

It is  worthwhile asking,  therefore,  why the groups  that sprang 
up were  not  those  that people wanted before they came,  why al-
most a  third could  be organized  by outsiders who  knew nothing 
about the new community, and whether the large number of Un-
intended  groups.  which  sprang  up  on  the  spur  of  the  moment, 
repr.esented  the  impact  of  community  conditions  on  the  origin 
process. 

One answer suffices  for  all  three questions.  How organizations 
were founded was  ultimately less relevant than what happened to 
them  once  they  were  founded.  No  organization,  however  it 
started,  could  exist  beyond  the  initial  meeting without respond-
ing  to  some  needs  among  the  members  it  attracted,  and  these 
needs were not only more important than founders'  or members' 

The  Beginnings  of  Group  Life 

•  61  • 

preoccupancy  aspirations,  but  they  developed  largely  after  peo-
ple had  lived  in  Levittown  for  a  while.  External,  Internal,  and 
Unintended groups alike responded to  these  needs, which  turned 
out to be more social  than civic  or familial;  or to  put  it another 
way,  civic  and  familial  needs  were  satisfied  by  public  agencies 
and political groups, leaving the voluntary associations  to fill  the 
social  needs. 

Aside  from  the few  civic  groups,  which  tried  to  intervene  in 
municipal  affairs,  and  the  men's  service  clubs,  which  provided 
"community-minded"  activities  for  the  lawyers,  salesmen,  real-
tors,  and  politicians  who  needed  to  advertise  themselves  in  the 
community,  the  organizations  were  primarily  sorting  groups 
which divided and segregated  people  by  their  interests  and  ulti-
mately,  of  course,  by  socio-economic,  educational,  and  religious 
differences.  On  the  block,  people  who  shared  a  common  space 
could  not  really  express  their  diversity;  the  community  sorting 
groups came  into  being ,for  this  purpose. 

Men could divide andsegregate themselves on the job, but the 
women had  to do it in the community, and partly for  this reason 
most  organizations  were  sexually  separated,  with  only  some  of 
those  appealing  to  upper middle class  people  providing  "coedu-
cational" activities. The total array of women's groups offered the 
opportunity  for  extremely  fine  sorting.  Well-educated  women 
would  be  likely  to  find  compatible  people  and  activities  in  the 
American  Association  for  University  Women,  the  League  of 
Women  Voters,  Great  Books,  or  the  Better  Schools  Committee, 
and,  if  they  were  more  socially  inclined,  the  Pan-Hellenic  Soci-
ety;  those  with  less  than  a  college  degree  could  choose  from 
among  a  dozen  groups.  Working  class  women  clung  to  the 
church-the Altar and Rosary Society was  the town's largest club 
a year after it was started-or joined the auxiliaries of their hus-
bands'  groups.  Religious  sorting  was  also  available,  for  every 
church had men's and women's groups,  and some secular organi-
zations  became  predominantly  Catholic,  others  Protestant  or 
Jewish.  The Jews  had  their  own  secular  clubs  which  sorted  by 
age  and  class.  Occupational  specialties  were  honored;  ex-nurses 
worked  in  hospital  auxiliaries  and  ex-teachers  became  active  in 
the PTA. One Levittowner even  talked about a  Texas club;  she 
too wanted to be "with her own." 

Organizational programs reflected these diversities. The organ-
izations  of  the  college-educated  stressed  cultural  activities  and 

•  62  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

local  or national  political  issues;  those  of the  high  school  gradu-
ates scheduled fashion  shows and lectures on beauty, home man-
agement, and child care.  The highly educated shunned "gossip," 
their  own  version  of  it  being  buried  in  the  discussion  of  social 
issues.  Games,  always  major  organizational  sidelines,  were  also 
stratified, ranging from poker, pinochle, and hearts up to canasta, 
scrabble,  and  bridge.  Municipal  services  and  formal  govern-
mental  institutions still  being in  a  primitive stage,  most  groups 
combined social  sorting with  a  variety of community service  ac-
tivities.  The upper middle class  groups  put on candidates'  night 
and  community  forums;  the  working  class  groups  concentrated 
on sports for  the children, fire-fighting,  and  Fourth of July cere-
monies;  the  lower  middle  class  groups'  activities  ranged  from 
rolling  bandages,  running  Miss  Levittown  contests,  and  collect-
ing  books  for  the  library  to  helping  the  Superintendent  of 
Schools. 

Needless  to  say,  the  kinds  of  sorting  groups  that  Levittown 
would  require  could  not  be  determined  until  after  people  had 
lived  there  for  a  while  and  could  see  how  many  friends  they 
could  find  on  the  block and what  charitable and  civic  activities 
needed  to  be  supplied.  As  a  result,  they  could  not  have  antici-
pated  before  arrival  what  kinds  of organizations  they  would  ac-
tually  join.9  Likewise,  the  organizations  could  not  anticipate 
their  members'  demands  and  needs  in  advance,  but  once  they 
knew them,  they  adapted to them.  This was  particularly  true  of 
national  and  Externally  founded  groups,  which  developed  new 
functions  in  Levittown  having little  to do with  the reasons  they 
came or with  the aims  in their national charters. 10  These groups 
succeeded  only  because  they  were  able  to  bend  to  local  needs 
when  necessary. 11  For  example,  two  Jewish  national  women's 
groups  became  essentially  neighborhood  clubs  for  young,  man-
agerial  upper middle class  women  and older,  lower  middle  class 
women,  respectively.  Most  of  their  members  knew  little  about 
the  national  organization but simply wanted Jewish companion-
ship.  A  4-H group was rescued  after a  poorly attended organiza-
tional  meeting because  the county agent chanced  on a  clique of 
teenage  girls  who  needed  a  club  to keep  the group  together,  al-
though they were not particularly interested in the 4-H program. 
The  national  groups  were  rarely  aware  of  how  their  branches 
changed in Levittown-but then they did not care particularly, so 
long as they could add to their membership rolls. 

The  Beginnings  of  Group  Life

The  Unintentionally  founded  clubs  were  not  much  different 
from  the others.  Although  they  did  not  have  to  alter  themselves 
to succeed,  they too functioned primarily as sorting groups. Some 
were,  of  course,  generated  by  community  conditions,  for  ex-
ample, the Sitters clubs, which responded to the shortage of baby-
sitters, and  a  Juvenile  Discussion  gmup  which  met  to  do  some-
thing about juvenile delinquency.  Sometimes community condi-
tions  hastened  the  arrival  of groups  that would  eventually  have 
developed  anyway.  The  Jewish  community  organized  almost 
immediately  because Jewish women  found  themselves  ill at ease 
with  their neighbors,  and an  institution was  needed  to  celebrate 
Chanukah so the children could be discouraged from demanding 
Christmas trees. 

Yet none of the sorting needs and community conditions were 
so  distinctive  as  to  require  unique  organizations.  The ability of 
national  groups  to  bend  to  local  priorities  helped,  but even  the 
local  associations,  40  per cent of the  total,  were modeled on sim-
ilar  organizations  elsewhere  and  none  was  entirely  original  to 
Levittown.  They  were,  rather,  typical  of  those  found  in  most 
other suburbs and communities of young families of similar class. 
In  fact,  although  they  considered  themselves  community-wide 
organizations,  almost  half  of  thirty-six  for  which  membership 
addresses  were  available  drew  most  of  their  people  from  one or 
two neighborhoods.  Clearly,  people cared less about the nominal 
purpose and scope  of  the group  than  to  be with  fellow  residents 
who  had  come  to  Levittown  at  about  the  same  time  and  were 
compatible in other ways. 

THE STRUCTURE OF ORGANIZATIONS 

As  is  usually  the  case,  most  organizations  consisted  of  a  small 
group of ac1ive  people and a  large  number of members who did 
little  more  than  attend  meetings.  Able  administrators  to do  the 
time-consuming  work  required  by  every  project-even  a  seem-
ingly simple affair like a  bazaar or bakesale required hundreds of 
woman-hours  and  phone  calls-were scarce.  Women  were  espe-
cially  loath  to take  responsible  positions,  and  pioneers remained 
in  their  organizations  even  after  they  had  served  as  presidents 
and could rise no higher.  In  1964,  many of the same people were 
still active in-and sometimes in control of--groups that had been 
founded  in  1959· Any person who  had shown  himself or herself 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

to be effective  in one group was  asked  to  help  in  other organiza-
tions.  Although  some  complained  about  the  workload,  they 
found  it  difficult  to  turn  down  these  requests.12  Saying  no  re-
peatedly. might brand  them as  "uncooperative" or "l;tcking com-
munity spirit,"  and  unless  they  wanted  to  leave  community  life 
altogether,  the  threat was enough to make them cooperative. 

As  a  result,  interlocking  directorates  were  created,  with  the 
same  people or their  friends  holding leadership positions  in sev-
eral  groups.  Sometimes,  leaders  who  were  friends  and  worked 
well  together  even  moved  en  masse  to  other  groups  and  even-
tually became important leadership cliques in them. For example, 
several middle class Catholics-some managers, others salesmen-
came  together  in  the  VFW  shortly  after  the  community  was 
founded.  Then  they  helped  to  organize  the  Catholic  parish,  the 
Levittown  Youth  Sports Association,  and subsequently  the  Holy 
Name Society.  Some also  became politically active,  later running 
for  the  school  board  and  Township  Committee.  Naturally,  they 
formed  alliances between  these groups,  and eventually they were 
defined  as  spokesmen  for  Levittown's  Catholics,  politicians  and 
others  consulting  them  on  issues  affecting  their  coreligionists. 
On  the  whole,  interlocking  directorates  and  alliances  devel-
oped  only  among  like-minded  organizations,  "like-minded"  be-
ing  defined  primarily  by  common  interests  and  membership 
characteristics.  The  small  group  of  cosmopolitans  created  al-
liances  between  the  Citizens'  Aswciation  for  Public Schools,  the 
county Human Relations Council, the League of Women Voters, 
the  American  Association  of  University  Women,  and  even  such 
cultural  groups as  the  Great  Books  Club, calling on these organ-
izations  for  help  on  salient  issues.  A  large  number  of  groups, 
principally  of  lower  middle  class  women,  including  the  PT As 
and the  Federated Women's Club, joined to collect books for  the 
library.  Those drawing from  working class residents (such as  the 
veterans'  groups)  cooperated  on  parades  and  other  ceremonies 
for national  holidays.  The Boy Scouts worked with the churches, 
encouraging  them  to  sponsor  troops,  in  return  for  which  the 
Scout program, as one Scout executive pointed out, "takes the boy 
up  tC'  •.he  steps  of  the  church  and  motivates  him  to enter." 

These  coalitions  were  encouraged  by  the  relative  internal 
homogeneity  of  individual  organizations.  Being  sorting  groups, 
or  being  nationally  affiliated,  many  Levittown  organizations  at-
tracted members of common background, and their leaders were 

The  Beginnings  of  Group  Life 

•  65  • 

thus  able  to  bring  them  into  alliances  without  creating  dissent. 
For  example,  the  Federated  Women's  Club  attracted  mostly 
Protestant  lower  middle  class  women  somewhat  older  than  the 
rest  of  the  community  and  with  more  than  average  interest  in 
community  service.  This  happened  quite  unintentionally,  but 
since  it  was  a  national  organization  with  a  set  and  well-known 
image,  Jews  and  Catholics  stayed  out  of  it;  so  did  women  who 
lacked  the  social  skills  they  felt  were  needed  and  those  more  in-
terested  in  political  or  cultural  activities.  Groups  oriented  to 
children's  needs,  such  as  the  PT As  and  the  Scouts,  were  less 
stratified  by class  and religion,  although  they  naturally attracted 
more middle class  members  than working class  ones. 

Joining  with  other  organizations  on  community  projects  was 
considered desirable  because  it  would  create  favorable  publicity 
for  the  individual  groups,  and  thus  attract  more  members.  One 
of  these  joint activities,  the  erection  of  a  community  Christmas 
tree  in  1959,  resulted  in an abortive  attempt  to  set  up a  formal 
structure  of  organizations,  the  Levittown  Community  Council. 
The Council's founding  was  stimulated  by  the desire  to  prevent 
any  organization  garnering  more  publicity  and  credit  than  any 
other  for  joint  projects,  to  coordinate  organizational  activities, 
and  to minimize organizational  competition.  If community-wide 
meetings  and  community-wide  fund-raising  affairs  could  be 
scheduled  so  as  not  to  coincide,  they  would  be  better  attended 
and more profitable;  therefore,  the first-and last-project of the 
Council was  to set up an overall organizational meeting schedule. 
The  participating  organizations  were,  however,  still  so  eager  to 
maximize  their  own  membership,  and  therefore,  to  amass  pub-
licity and credit for community service,  that they were unwilling 
to cooperate in the coordinating venture. Under such conditions, 
there was  no  incentive  for  a  community  leader  or  politician  to 
step forward and make the Council his own bailiwick, and it dis-
appeared shortly after it was  founded.  Later,  the  businessmen in 
the  shopping center formed  an association  which  erected a  com-
munity Christmas tree every year,  staged other national  and reli-
gious  ceremonies,  and  put  on  entertainment  to  bring  shoppers 
into  the center. 

Some organizations had ties to the political system. The PT As 
were committed  to  defending  the  school  system  against  opposi-
tion,  but other organizations  had  a  more  voluntary relationship 
with  politics.  Leading  political  figures  were  also  active  in  a 

•  66  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

variety  of  voluntary  associations  in  order  to  demonstrate  their 
community-mindedness to the voters and to use  the organizations 
as  listening  posts.  Many  of  them,  being  lawyers  and  insurance 
and real estate salesmen, also  had occupational reasons for  being 
active.  Then  too,  it  had  long  been  a  county  tradition  for  the 
major fund drives,  such as  the  March of Dimes, cancer and heart 
funds,  and the annual campaigns by local  hospitals,  to be headed 
by leading politicians. This not only gave  the political parties an 
opportunity to do a  community service,  but also  helped  them to 
find  able party workers.  Some  organizations had more direct ties 
to  the  political  parties.  For  example/ several  VFW  leaders  were 
active Democrats,  and many members of the Junior Chamber of 
Commerce,  Kiwanis,  and  Rotary  were  Republicans.  Although 
these  organizations  had  no official  ties  to either  party,  they  gave 
covert support to party activities,  and  the  parties reciprocated  by 
supporting organizational projects. The political alliances helped 
to  split  the  total  array of organizations  even  further,  so  that  the 
emerging structure was actually an aggregate of competing inter-
ests  and temporary coalitions reflecting  the diversity and conflict 
in the political sphere.

8.  If the  neighborhood  PTAs  and  the  men's,  women's,  youth,  and

would easily  reach  100. 

9·  Later, all belonging to social and civic groups and 73  per cent be-
longing  to  the men's service  clubs said  they  had  not  intended  to 
join  these  groups  before  coming  to  Levittown,  as  compared  to 
only 31  per cent of those in the PTA, the Scouts, and other child-
centered organizations. 

10.  Although  61  per  cent  of  memberships  in  national  organizations 
were intended before arrival, as compared to none in local groups, 
this reflected mainly the willingness of Mobiles and Transients to 
rejoin groups in which they had been active  before. 

11.  Men's needs seemed more predictable;  73  per cent of their groups 
were  intended,  as  compared  to  only  48  per cent  of  the  women's, 
the latter's founding responding more directly to the sorting needs 
that  developed  in  the  community.  Also,  middle  class  founders 
were  more responsive  to their fellow  residents  than  working class 
ones;  56  per  cent  of  organizations  with  predominantly  working 
class  memberships  depending  on  External  founders,  and  only  6 
per  cent  on  Internal  ones.  Among  middle  class  groups,  only  9 
per cent were founded Externally and 48  per cent Internally. 
12.  These complaints have become immortalized as  the  theory of sub-
urban hyperactivity.  In  Levittown,  hyperactivity was  limited  to  a 
few  people,  because  the  majority  were  reluctant  to  become  in-
volved in strenuous organizational activity.

THE  FOUNDING  OF 
CHURCHES 

D 

D 

D 

IN  AMERICA,  CHURCHES,  WITH  THE  EXCEPTION  OF  THE  CATHOLIC 
Church, are voluntary associations  in that people are free  to join 
or stay away  and can choose  their denomination. As  a  result,  the 
origin  of churches differed  from  that of  secular  organizations  in 
only  one  respect:  most  were  founded  Externally.  Nineteen 
churches  (and  synagogues)  were  established  in  Levittown  by 
1964,  thirteen during the firs_t  two years,  and of  the  initial  ones, 
ten  were  organized  Externally.  Most  of  the  churches  received 
help from  Levitt, who gave  them free  land to  hasten  the erection 
of a building, partly to make the town more attractive to purchas-
ers.  Levittlfi  requirement  that  the  churches  build  a  year  after 
organization  or forfeit  the site  (although  they  could get another 
later)  encouraged External agencies to  take  over their formation, 
although they have also  done so in other suburbs where free land 
was  not available.  Moreover,  the  fundamentalist  Protestant sects 
in  Levittown,  which  were  not  given  free  land,  also  organized 
Externally,  and  the  Jews,  who  were  given  land,  nevertheless 
formed  their  synagogues  Unintentionally.  Other  explanations 
must  therefore account for  the emphasis on External  formation. 
Perhaps  the  principal reason  is  that churches,  like nationwide 
voluntary  associations,  want  to  add  new  branches  and  congre-
gants, and Levittown provided the opportunity-particularly for 
a  group  of  "minor"  Protestant  denominations  (the  Dutch  Re-
formed,  the  Evangelical  United  Brethren,  and  the  Church  of 

•  68  • 

The  Founding  of  Churches 

•  6g  • 

Christ)  which  had long been  losing  ground  to  the  "major"  ones 
(Methodists,  Baptists,  Lutherans,  Episcopalians,  and  Presbyte-
rians).  They hoped  that  they  could  expand  in  a  large  new  com-
munity,  especially  if  they  came  early  to  attract  the  unchurched 
and  those  wanting  to  switch  denominations. 1  The  builder 
wanted  minor  denominations  in  Levittown,  knowing  from  pre-
vious experience  that  they would offer  extra community services 
as a means of attracting congregants. What the purchasers wanted 
was  difficult  to  say.  None  of  the  pre-occupancy  aspirations  re-
ferred  to  church  activities,  although  later  interviews  indicated 
that 71  per cent then belonging to a church had intended to join 
before  arrival,  and  most  Protestants  chose  the  denomination  to 
which they had belonged before, only  13  per cent switching. The 
presence of a  large  number of people committed  to  membership 
in  a  specific  denomination  probably  explains  why  so  many 
churches  could  be  founded  Externally,  and  the  availability  of a 
significant,  though  smaller,  number  of  unchurched  and  "swit-
chers" explains why three minor denominations could be started, 
even  though only a  handful of Levittowners had previously been 
members of them. 

mE PLANNED  CHURCHESz  PROTESTANT  AND  CATHOLIC 
Despite  organizational  and  doctrinal  differences  among  the  de-
nominations,  the  formation  of  new  congregations  followed  a  re-
markably  similar  pattern.  Before  Levittown  was  occupied,  the 
national  or state denominational office  began  to plan.  Most  Prot-
estant  denominations  today  have  research  departments,  and 
these,  using figures  from  other Levittowns  and  similar  new  sub-
urban  towns,  estimated  the  number  of  congregants  of  their  de-
nomination  likely  to  purchase  in  Levittown.  Some  even  pro-
jected how  much  Levittowners could  be  expected  to  donate  and 
how  soon  they  would  be able  to  pay  for  a  building.  Meanwhile, 
the denomination selected a  minister,  often called a  "starter," to 
organize the new congregation. Typically, he arrived in the com-
munity  shortly  after  its  opening and  held  services  either  in  his 
home  or  at  a  school  until  the  church  building  was  completed. 
Concurrently,  national church headquarters continued  the  plan-
ning process and, when the building plans were ready,  ask~d the 
minister to formally organize the congregation,  elect officers,  and 
have  them  review  the  plans.  Once  the  plans  were  accepted,  the 

•  70  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

national  church made a  grant or a  loan  to  the  Levittown  group 
to  enable  it  to  build  a  church  within  the  time  limit  of  the 
builder. 

Although  the  churches  were  thus  essentially  preplanned,  the 
preferences  of future  congregants  had  to  be considered.  For ex-
ample,  the  National  Lutheran  Council  used  data about  the  reli-
gious  preferences  of  young  Lutheran  suburbanites  and  chose  a 
liberal  branch  of  Gennan origin  which  had  lost  its  ethnic char-
acter rather than  the less  Americanized  Augustana  synod  or  the 
theologically conservative  Missouri  synod.  The  plans  themselves 
were  not  implemented  until  they  had  been  reviewed  by  the 
fledgling  congregations  or  their  officers,  who  were  often  Levit-
towners  with  previous  church-organizing  experience.  The  work 
of the External  planners was  usually accepted,  but some congre-
gations questioned  the design  of the buildings.  Many of the lay-
men  and  some  of  the  ministers  wanted  a  Colonial  church-a 
white  frame  building with a  steeple-believing that was  what  a 
church  ought  to  look  like.  Since  the  costs  of  this  design  were 
high,  all  but one of the  churches finally  assented  to the contem-
porary  style  proposed  by 
the  denominational  architects, 
frequently adding a small steeple to it, however. 

But  by  far  the  most  important  step  in  planning  the  new 
churches  was  the  selection  of  the  minister.  Although  doctrine 
holds  that  people must be attracted by  theology and liturgy,  the 
fate  of  the  church  depended  considerably on  the  first  ministers. 
They  had  not  only  to  attract  people,  but also  weld  them  into a 
congregation quickly and persuade them to work and contribute 
funds-and often  they were in competition with other ministers. 
Given  the  looseness  of denominational  allegiances among young 
Protestants,  all  but  the  Lutheran  and  Episcopalian  ministers 
stood  the  chance  of  losing  potential  congregants  to  other 
churches.  Knowing  all  this,  the  denominations  selected  young 
men  who  understood  the  problems  of  young  families  and  who 
themselves  wanted  to come  to  Levittown,  attracted  by  the  chal-
lenge  of  a  new  church  and  a  higher  salary.  The denominations 
chose  well,  because  all  but  two  of the  eight  Protestant ministers 
who  came  were  later  named  to  their  posts  permanently.  The 
other two were culturally too different from their congregants to 
be able to bring them into the church. 

The  Lutherans  and  Episcopalians  organized  their  churches 
after  Levittowners called  the  national  office,  asking  them  to get 

The  Founding  of  Churches

started  ahead  of  the  planning schedule,  but almost  all  other de-
nominations began  before any demand  for  them  had  manifested 
itself.  Once  they  had  moved  in,  the  ministers  began  to  go  from 
door  to  door  to  enroll  members.  The  "major"  ministers  had  a 
difficult  time;  they had a quota to fill  in order to start the church, 
and  they  could  recruit  the  unchurched  but  not  people  from 
other denominations_  On the other hand,  the "minor" ministers, 
who  found  only a  few  from  their  own  denominations,  could  in-
vite anyone they wished. As a result, the former accused the latter 
of "stealing" congregants. 

The  minor  ministers  were  also  more  "client-oriented"  than 
their competitors.  They began  to  build  more  quickly,  knowing 
from  past  experience  that  many  people  would  not  come  to  ser-
vices  until  a  building was  erected_  In one case,  the  building was 
begun  when  only seventeen  families  belonged  to  the church,  al-
though  the  usual  lower  limit  was  100  members.  The  minister 
also persuaded  his superiors to build a  Colonial church to-attract 
more  people.  Minor  denominations  organized  women's  and 
men's social  groups more quickly as  well,  even  though this could 
detract  attention  from  the  congregational  organization  or cause 
turmoil  in  the  church.  The social  organizations  being  more  in-
formal  than the church, people felt  freer  to express their dissatis-
factions  about  the  church  in  them.  In  fact,  a  congregant  revolt 
that led  to  the removal  of the  Methodist minister had its start  in 
the  couples'  club.  One minority church started  Levittown's  first 
nursery school  to  advertise  its  presence  and  community spirit-
only  to  find  itself  most  popular  with  Jewish  residents.  Perhaps 
the most successful  recruitment approach was  taken  by one min-
ister who immediately immersed himself in civic activity, was  the 
first  to offer counseling services,  and  by his  self-styled  ability "to 
talk like a  truckdriver" attracted working class residents. 

The mixture of community service and client-centered recruit-
ment enabled the minor churches to enroll a  respectable number 
of congregants.  In  tg6t,  they  each  averaged  100 adult  members, 
compared  to  300 each  among the major churches.  Three fourths 
of the members  of one minor congregation and  half of a  second 
had crossed  denominational  lines after coming  to  Levittown,  al-
though, of all church-going Protestants only  13 per cent had done 
so.  The  minor  denominations  had  also  become  neighborhood 
churches,  drawing  So  per  cent  or  more  of  their  members  hom 
one neighborhood, whereas  the major denominations drew from

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

all  over  Levittown.  The minor church  which  had  organized  the 
most  social  groups  had  attracted  twice  as  many  members as  an-
other which had organized none. 

Three  fundamentalist  churches  were  also  founded  in  Levit-
town during the first  two years, by the same External method and 
with  only  a  little  less  planning.  They  were  not  given  free 
land  by  Levitt,  but  because. so  many  of  their  members  tithed, 
they needed only a small congregation to start building.  One was 
collecting  $woo a  week  from  65  individuals  three  months  after 
the church's  founding,  and  was  able  to  build within  a  year. 

The growth of both major and minor churches provided clear 
testimony  that  External  planning worked,  provided  it  was  done 
efficiently.  The ministers chosen  to carry it out understood  their 
congregants,  and  acceded  to  their  wishes  on  matters  of  impor-
tance to them. The willingness of Externally planned churches to 
function  thus  is  nicely  illustrated  by  the  Catholic  parish,  espe-
cially since the Catholic Church  is  often  thought  to be a  central-
ized and monolithic body in which parishioners are  powerless.  In 
theory the state diocese  has complete control over the timing and 
development  of  new  parishes.  The  Trenton  diocese,  which  was 
responsible  for  Levittown,  was  conservative  in  starting new  par-
ishes  and  believed  in  building churches  before  schools,  but  the 
Catholic  Levittowncrs forced  the diocese  to alter  both  the  speed 
and the character of its planning. Led by a young insurance sales-
man  who  went  from  door  to  door  and  registered  Catholic 
families  even  while  he  was  trying to  sell  insurance,  a  number of 
Lev;ttowners  pressured  the  diocese  to  organize  the  local  parish 
ahead  of  schedule,  and  eventually  it  agreed.  It  also  chose  as 
starter  and  permanent  priest  a  man  who  wanted  very  much  to 
come  to  Levittown  and  who,  like  his  future  parisqioners,  was 
more  interested  in  the  parochial  school  than  in .the ichurch.  Be-
cause  the  parish  would  need  more  than  the  three  acres  Levitt 
gave free,  the diocese bought its own eleven-acre site, but on that 
site built a  parochial school  which  included a  "worship area"  for 
Masses. 

Although the diocese gives the parish priest control over parish 
activities,  in  Levittown  he  had  to  adjust  the  organizational  pro-
cess  to  the  Levittowners.  An  usher's group,  functioning as  repre-
sentative of the parishioners,  had been formed before he arrived, 
and Holy Name and Altar and Rosary societies were set up ahead 
of schedule  because  parishioners wanted  them.  Financing a  new

parish  is  costly,  an:d  both  capital  and  operating  expenditures 
must come from the voluntary donations of the parishioners. Had 
the pastor not responded to  their wishes,  their willingness to pro· 
vide  financial  support  might  have  been  reduced. 

Indeed,  the  only  church  to  run  into  serious  organizational 
difficulties  was  the  Methodist,  which  had  been  in  the  township 
for  over  a  hundred  years.  A  new  building was  put  up  to  make 
room  for  the  Levittowners,  but  the  previous  minister  was  re-
tained.  Although  a  young  man,  he  was  more  comfortable  with 
farmers  than with suburbanites and sided continuously with  the 
old  residents  against  the  newcomers.  His  failure  to  allow  the 
Levittowners to assume positions of leadership, his disapproval of 
dancing and movies,  and his overall  conservatism  led to a  defini-
tional  struggle,  but  since  the  congregation  cannot  remove  the 
minister  and  he  proved  resistant  to  change,  the  struggle  soon 
blossomed into an active revolt which lasted  for  over a  year until 
his  superiors  eventually  transferred  him.  No  other  Protestant 
church experienced a real definitional struggle. 

TIIE UNPLANNED CHURCHES:  TIIE JEWS 

Congregation  Beth-Torah,  the  Conservative  synagogue,  and 
Temple  Emanu-El,  the  Reform  synagogue,  were  both  un-
planned.' Although  all  three  branches of Judaism are  organized 
into national agencies, and the Reform branch has  been active in 
starting  new  suburban  temples,  traditional  Jewish  practice  has 
been so  emphatically congregational  that Levittown's Jews never 
thought of calling on, or waiting for,  the External agencies  to set 
up synagogues.  And  if any  resident came  to  Levittown  with  the 
intention of starting a synagogue, he never had an opportunity to 
act,  for community conditions  led  to  the  rapid  and  Unintended 
formation  of both.8 

Barely  three  weeks  after  the  first  purchasers  had  arrived  in 
Levittown,  a  synagogue  Sisterhood  in  nearby  Riverside  invited 
one of its  past members-now a  Levittowner-to a  hat show.  Be-
lieving that this synagogue and another in  Burlington might "go 
after"  the  Levittown  Jews  and  thus  prevent  the  founding  of  a 
local congregation, she concluded that there was no time to spare. 
Besides, it was almost Christmas, and her children wondered why 
they  should celebrate  Chanukah when  everyone  else  was  prepar-
ing for Christmas. Although neither she nor her husband had orig-

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

inally  wanted  to  start  a  synagogue  in  Levittown,  they  obtained 
the names of the first  twenty-six Jewish families from a  Protestant 
minister and  called a  meeting  early  in  December  1958. 

She  was  evidently  not  alone  in  her  feeling  of  urgency,  for  at 
least one person from  every Jewish  family was  in her living room 
that night. After a  brief discussion, which indicated that all  three 
branches  of  Judaism  were  represented,  it  was  decided  that  ser-
vices  would  be  held  the  week  after  and  that  the  organizational 
discussion  would  continue  at  another  meeting.  At  the  second 
meeting,  people  who  had come  the  first  time  only  to  meet other 
Jews  socially  did  not  reappear,  but  representatives  from  about 
fifteen  families  set  up  the  skeleton  of  a  formal  organization, 
called the Jewish Community Center, and elected  the man whose 
wife  had  called  the  first  meeting as  an  unwilling chairman. 

For  the  next  six  weeks,  services  were  held  every  Friday night, 
and  after  services,  as  well  as  between  times,  there  were  long de-
bates  about  the  formation  of a  congregation.  Although  everyone 
agreed  there  were  enough  people  for  only  one  synagogue,  they 
disagreed  about  which  branch  of  Judaism  it  should  profess.  A 
small  group of  men,  led  by  a  German refugee,  wanted a  Reform 
congregation,  and  another,  yet  smaller,  an  Orthodox  one.  The 
Orthodox faction  was  particularly unhappy over the  prominence 
of  women  in  the  organizational  deliberations  and  advocated,  as 
is  Orthodox custom, a  synagogue  with separate seating for  them. 
The  women  had  no  desire  to  be  either  segregated  or  excluded, 
however.  Most had no intense preference for one branch over an-
other, but were so  eager to get Jewish community life under way 
that they founded  a  Sisterhood even while the men were still  de-
bating about  the  synagogue.  The majority of the  participants in 
the  debate  were  Conservative,  and  eventually,  the  choice  nar-
rowed down to a Conservative or a  Reform congregation. 

The conflict  centered  around  religious  practices  in  the  syna-
gogue,  particularly wearing  hats  at  services,  and  the  obser\tance 
of dietary laws at synagogue socials.  Few people wanted to main-
tain  these  practices  either at home  or in  the  synagogue,  but  the 
Conservatives felt  that the synagogue ought to uphold them even 
if  the  members'  behavior  diverged;  the  Reform  group  argued 
that this was hypocrisy.  I£ Jews did not want to keep the Kashrut 
laws at home or wear hats during prayer, they said,  the synagogue 
should not do so  either.  "Reform  is  the religion  of  the  people," 
one  man  pointed  out.  "Each  congregation  can  choose  its  own 

The  Founding  of  Churches 

•  75  • 

form  of  worship,  with  or  without  hats.  The  Conservatives  are 
boss-run  by  the  rabbis." 4  Much  of  the  argument  concerned  the 
children. The Reform group argued that the rabbi should not be 
allowed  to  persuade children  to  follow  a  tradition  their  parents 
were  unwilling  to  maintain  in  the  home.  The  Conservatives 
agreed  that  they did not want  their children coming home from 
Sunday school  demanding the keeping of the dietary  laws  or ob-
servance  of  the  Sabbath,  but  they  did  want  the  synagogue  to 
continue  teaching  the  tradition.  Since  the  two  groups  agreed 
that  the  synagogue  could  not  compel  observance  in  the  home, 
and  since  they  wanted  to  establish  a  single  congregation,  they 
continued to look for a  formula  that would preserve  their fragile 
unity.  One  man  suggested  that  the  group  form  a  community 
center,  the  eventual  building  to  have  a  Conservative  and  a  Re-
form  wing.  Every meeting verged on a split and, in near despera-
tion,  they invited rabbis from  each  branch  of Judaism  to  discuss 
the  alternatives  before  taking  a  vote  on  their  final  choice.  Al-
though everyone knew  the issues that were causing disagreement, 
it was  hoped  that  the  ral:-bis  would  somehow  find  a  way  to  keep 
the  group  together,  so  the  Levittowners  insisted  that  they  could 
not "sell" their own branch of Judaism. 

At the  time,  the Conservative movement was not interested  in 
setting up new synagogues.  It had grown so  rapidly over the past 
decade  and  was  so  short  of  rabbis  and  building  funds  that  the 
national  office  was  unwilling even  to  send a  rabbi,  and someone 
had to be recruited from a  Philadelphia synagogue.  The Reform 
movement,  however,  was  interested  in  expansion,  and  had  some 
funds  to aid new synagogues.  Consequently,  it  sent an  executive 
from  the national office who made what he called a  "spirited sales 
talk" for  Reform Judaism, in the course of which he attacked the 
Conservative  movement  as  well.  This  was  no  accident,  for  he 
wanted  to see  a  Reform synagogue  in  Levittown.  The Conserva-
tives  were  enraged,  accusing  the  Reform  advocates  of  violating 
the agreement. The latter replied angrily, and about  11  P.M.  that 
night they withdrew-with the rabbi at the head-to set up a  Re-
form  congregation.  Two  days  later,  the  Conservatives  and  the 
handful  of  Orthodox  residents  met  to  organize  a  Conservative 
congregation-then called  the  Jewish  Community  Center-and, 
a  week later,  the  Sisterhood affiliated  with  it. 

After  this  unintended  (though  probably  inevitable)  begin-
ning the  two new congregations asked  External agencies for  help 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

to obtain rabbis and funds to pay their salaries until the member-
ships  were  large  enough  to  pay  them.  The  Reform  movem.ent 
:was  able  and  willing  to  give  both,  but  the  Conservative  move-
ment suggested  that the Levittowners merge with a synagogue in 
Burlington which  needed  an  infusion  of  new  blood.  The Levit· 
towners wanted their own synagogue, however, and turned to the 
Orthodox movement.  Once  the largest  branch of  Judaism  in the 
country,  but now  declining  in  popular  support,  it  had  an  over-
supply  of  rabbis  and  was  willing  to  send  one,  and  even  to con· 
tribute  to  his  salary,  provided  the  Levittowners  would  not 
affiliate  formally with  the  Conservative movement. Although the 
majority  of  the  group  was  not  enthusiastic  about  having  an 
Orthodox  rabbi,  it  finally  accepted  a  young man  who  agreed to 
conduct  services  largely  in  English,  keep  his  personal  religious 
practices to himself, and promise not to demand observance from 
the  children.  Later,  one  of  his  congregants  concluded  that  "his 
orthodoxy gives  us  no  trouble.  He lets us  do what we  want  and 
we  honor his  theory.  If we  had a rabbi who did what we wanted, 
we wouldn't respect him." 

Once  both  congregations  materialized,  enthusiasm  for  reli-
gious activity dimmed; for that matter, attendance at services  had 
never  been  very  high.  Clearly the Jews--Reform and  Conserva-
tive  alike-sought  a  subcommunity  rather  than  a  religious con· 
gregation.  They  wanted  to  be  Jews  (and  to  be  with  Jews),  and 
they  wanted  their  children  to  learn  Jewish  culture  patterns 
which  parents  themselves  were  neither willing nor able  to  teach 
them at home, but they did not want to attend services,  except at 
the  "High Holidays."  Later, when parents with teenagers moved 
into Levittown,  it became apparent that another function  of  the 
Jewish  subcommunity  was  to  prevent  intermarriage.  Several 
Jewish  organizations set  up  teenage  groups to engage youngsters 
in the Jewish community so  that they would not date non-Jewish 
Levittowners.  There was  no  restriction  on  other social  relation-
ships  with  non-Jewish  peers,  however;  only  dating  them  was 
taboo. 

If  the  Jews  wanted  a  subcommunity  only  to  maintain  the 
ethnic tradition and prevent outmarriage, they could presumably 
have created a nonreligious body. This alternative was never con-
sidered,  however,  for  the  tradition  was  conceived  as  a  religious 
one and the synagogue was  expected to maintain ethnic cohesion 
as  well.  Besides,  no  one had  yet  invented  the combination com-

munity-and-social  center with  a  marginal religious  program  that 
most  people  seemed  to  prefer.  A  year  or so  later,  after  the  Con-
servatives  had raised  their dues,  some  parents  tried  to organize a 
Hebrew  Academy,  a  school  for  the  children  which  would  also 
conduct  annual  High  Holiday  services  for  the  adults,  but  not 
enough families  turned out for  the organizational  meeting to ac-
tivate  it.  The  failure  of  the  Academy  suggests  that  the  syna-
gogue's  function  was  not  to  represent  what  Jews  did,  but  what 
they  felt  they ought  to do:  to  maintain  the  tradition whether or 
not  the members observed  it.  As  one  Conservative  leader  put it, 
"I work on Saturdays and I  eat ham, but I want my rabbi to walk 
to  the synagogue  and  keep  kosher.  My  children  are  growing  up 
here,  and  I  want  a  traditional  environment  for  them  so  that 
when  they are about seventeen,  they can  choose  for  themselves." 
The  purpose  of  the  synagogue  was  to  keep  the  children  in  the 
fold  to  prevent outmarriage,  but to  leave  the adults  uninvolved. 5 
Nevertheless,  an  adult  Jewish  subcommunity  materialized 
quickly.  Although  the constant nagging of synagogue  leaders  for 
members  did  not  bring  them  into  the  congregations,  it  did 
create,  through  social  pressure,  a  feeling  of  obligation  and  the 
recognition  that  in  the  case  of crisis-such  as  the  emergence  of 
anti-Semitism-the  Jews  would  stand  together.  Moreover,  the 
mere existence  of synagogues  could  be  used  by  parents as  an  ex-
ample  to  persuade  their  children  to  attend  the  Sunday  schools 
(and  among  the  Conservatives,  the  afternoon  Hebrew  school). 
But most  important, Jewish adults were  vitally  interested  in get-
ting  together  with  other  Jews,  and  ultimately,  what  held  the 
Jewish  community  together  was  sociability.  Both  congregations 
soon  had Sisterhoods with more members than the congregations 
of which  they were nominally subsidiaries.  The Sisterhoods were 
run  by  people  from  the  first  two  neighborhoods,  and  Jews  who 
moved into the later neighborhoods sought organizations of their 
own;  the  Reform  women  tended  to  join  B'nai  B'rith;  younger 
Conservative women, O.R.T.;  ani older ones,  Hadassah.  In addi-
tion,  there was  an intricate network of cliques which entertained 
and  partied,  formed  card  clubs,  and  engaged  in  a  never-ending 
round of other social  activities.  Before  long,  the  Jews  had  more 
organizations and organizational memberships per capita than all 
other  Levittowners.6 

The  men  concentrated  on  organizing  the  congregations,  al-
though they also had a men's club with poker groups and Sunday 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

morning  softball  games.  In  the  fall  of  1960,  B'rith  Sholom,  a 
Jewish fraternal  lodge in Philadelphia, called on five  ex-members 
who  had  moved  to  Levittown,  to  consider  the  possibility  of  set-
ting  up  a  branch.  Evidently  there  had  been  considerable  silent 
yearning for such a group, for within three months the lodge had 
almost one hundred members, only a  few  less  than the Conserva-
tive synagogue had been able to enroll in over a year of strenuous 
campaigning. The lodge attracted men who had tired of working 
to secure the survival of the synagogue and wanted a  purely social 
group. As  one of the founders of the Center, who had quit to be-
come a charter member of the lodge,  put it, "I like it because it's 
not a  fund-raising  thing,  it's just social.  We  use  the  money  only 
for  social  affairs.  Each  event  is  run  at cost  and  there  are  lots  of 
them. So we get out to dinners this way,  and this weekend,  there 
is a splash party . . . .  " 

Meanwhile,  the  devel0pment  of  the  congregations  proceeded 
slowly.  The  Reform  congregation  had  an  easier  time  of  it.  Its 
membership numbered  less  than half of that of the Jewish Com-
munity  Center  but  it  had  national  guidance  and  financial  sup-
port, whereas  the Jewish  Community Center had  to raise almost 
all  of its own funds and also had to struggle to keep the peace be-
tween  a  predominantly Conservative membership and an  Ortho-
dox rabbi. 

What attracted adults to the synagogue were  the High Holiday 
services.  Most  Jews  attended  synagogue  only  twice  a  year,  for 
Rosh Hashana and Yom  Kippur services. As a result, membership 
accelerated  just  before  the  High  Holidays.  In  addition,  people 
with children of Sunday school age  became members, for  this was 
the  only  way  in  which  they  could  enroll  the  children  in  the 
school.  One  membership  chairman  said  that  only  perfunctory 
pressure was  put on  Jews  with  younger children,  for  they could 
not be expected to join until  their children were of school age.  In 
June  1959,  the  two congregations had enrolled approximately 30 
per cent of Levittown's Jews;  two years  later,  the  proportion had 
risen  only  1  per  cent-not enough  to  put  the  synagogues  on  a 
solid  financial  footing.  Both  congregations  were  caught  in  a 
vicious circle;  in order to grow, they needed more programs, full-
time rabbis,  and  buildings,  but these cost money and  new  mem-
bers would  have  to  be attracted first.  A  synagogue  building was, 
of  course,  out  of  the  question,  but  the  Reform  movement  had 
bought a  Levitt  house  for  its  congregation  and  thereby  spurred 

The  Founding  of  Churches 

•  79  • 

the  Center to do likewise.  Even  the  upkeep of a  house  required 
more  members,  however,  and  both  groups  were  searching  for 
dynamic  lay  leaders able  to recruit  them.  New men were elected 
to  the  presidency  each  year  in  the  hope  that  they  would  mount 
successful membership campaigns. 

As  early  as  1959,  some  people  in  each  congregation  began  to 
feel  that lay leadership could not break the circle;  the only solu-
tion was  a  charismatic rabbi who could attract members in  large 
numbers, especially among the newer arrivals. The Center began 
to debate the  issue  first,  but,  having  to support itself from  dues, 
was  also  most sharply divided.  One group wanted  to  hire a  full-
time "go-getter" rabbi, even if it meant deficit financing;  another 
argued  for  slow  growth  and  a  part-time  rabbi  until  more  Jews 
moved to Levittown. The advocates of the full-time rabbi won by 
a  vote  in  1g6o, but at the last minute the only person  they could 
hire was a  "scholar" who could not deliver new members. 

In  1961,  the  same  factions  battled  again,  but  a  newcomer  to 
the Center returned  to  the  theme  of a  lay-centered congregation 
and  ran  for  the  presidency  on  the  platform  that  the  members 
could  support  a  rapidly  growing  congregation-provided,  how-
ever,  that they prepared to build, for only "a building" would at-
tract enough recalcitrant Jews to put the congregation on  its feet 
financially.  His victory drove out some of the proponents of slow 
growth,  but  he  brought  in  a  professional  fund  raiser  who  col-
lected  enough  in  pledges  to  initiate  a  building  program.  The 
new president also  helped  to select a  new rabbi who was  the "go-
getter"  the  congregation  had  long  been  looking  for.  This rabbi 
was  Orthodox,  for  Levittown  still  could  not afford  a  Conserva-
tive,  but he was an older man with enough experience in Conser-
vative  congregations  to know  that  he could not  convert  them  to 
Orthodoxy.  He was  not upset by the screening committee's insis-
tence  on  non-kosher  food  at  synagogue  socials--that  being 
cheaper-nor dismayed  by  poor  attendance  at  Friday  night ser-
vices.  He  built  up attendance somewhat by having children  par-
ticipate in the services,  which attracted their parents and friends, 
and he satisfied  his  own religious needs by meeting for daily ser-
vices  with  a  few  Orthodox Jews.  The rabbi's real  interest,  how-
ever,  was  in  enrolling  new  members  and  getting  a  synagogue 
erected.  With  his  coming,  the  Conservative  synagogue  began  to 
resemble  the minister-centered church of the Protestants, and al-
though  the  laymen  still  competed  for  officer  posts,  they  left  the 

•  Bo  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

running  of  the  synagogue  to  the  rabbi  and  devoted  themselves 
more  fully  to  social  and  other activities.  The  Reform  congrega-
tion  went  through  roughly  the  same  metamorphosis. 

The fund  raiser  for  the  Conservative  synagogue  was  an  effec-
tive  practitioner  of  his  craft,  who  knew  how  to  appeal  to  what 
was  evidently a  widespread desire  for  a  building.  A  Levittowner 
and  a  Catholic,  he  had  previously conducted  the  fund  drive  for 
his own church and had collected an amount that exceeded even 
his  expectations.  The  synagogue  fund  drive  was  aided  consider-
ably  by  $soo  pledges  from  a  small  group of  members,  and  by a 
Sisterhood  promise  to  collect  $w,ooo.  It was  probably  aided  by 
the maturing of the Jewish  population as  well,  for  as  more fami-
lies  had  children  of  Sunday  school  age,  congregational  member-
ship increased, reaching 45  per cent of the  town's Jewish  popula-
tion  by  1962.7  In  1963,  both  congregations  had  begun  to  erect 
synagogues, completing them in the sixth of the community's ex-
istence.  Their  co-religionists  in  Levittown,  Pennsylvania,  had 
taken only four years,  but then this community had grown  much 
more quickly  and  the Jewish  population  was  larger. 

PLANNED AND UNPLANNED RELIGIOUS  GROWTH 

The  formation  of  the  Jewish  subcommunity  points  up  the 
dilemmas of  planned and unplanned formation,  and of External 
and  Internal  initiative.  The  Externally  planned  churches  orga-
n:zed quickly and grew systematically about as scheduled, but the 
development of the Unintended synagogues was  slow  and  turbu-
lent,  depending as  it did on  the  varying needs  and moods of  the 
membership. Although the synagogues wanted to grow as  rapidly 
and  peacefully  as  the  churches,  they  could  not  easily  agree  on 
growth strategies.  For one thing,  they lacked studies--and the in-
clination  to  conduct  them-to determine  whether an  aggressive 
rabbi  or  a  building  would  actually  bring  in  more  members,  or 
whether only a  larger base  population could achieve  this aim.  In 
the  absence  of  knowledge,  each  faction  defended  what  to  it was 
the  most  comfortable  strategy.  The  merchants  and  other  sales 
people  were  inclined  toward  a  rabbinical  salesman,  the  profes-
sionals  wanted  a  scholar  with  whom  they  could  communicate, 
and  the  less  affluent  Jews  preferred  the cheapest  solution.  Even-
tually,  the  aggressive  rabbi  and  the  building did  swell  member-
ship,  but  the  debates  over  growth  strategy  had  also  postponed 

The  Founding  of  Churches 

•  81  • 

their  arrival  until  the  total  Jewish  population  had  increased. 
The definitional struggles had costs other than indecision. The 
debates  that  produced  the  split  were  carried  on  by  leaders  who 
were  extreme  partisans  of  their  positions.  Each  cared  deeply 
about  his  own  view  of  Judaism-which  is  what  made  them 
leaders-but  this  partisanship  also  intensified  religious  quarrels 
about which  the large majority cared less  and  prevented  the rise 
of  more  moderate  leaders  who  could  perhaps  have  achieved  a 
compromise.  More  important,  before  the  split  and  after,  differ-
ences  of  opinion  were  frequently  taken  personally,  resulting  in 
personal  animosities  that were  hard  to  bury.  After  evety debate 
or election some members  left or shifted to  the  other synagogue, 
while  others  refused  to  work  with  the  people  with  whom  they 
had argued.  Had new  leaders  who  were  uninvolved  in  past  ani-
mosities  not  been  available  from  among  later  arrivals  to  Levit-
town,  the synagogues would probably have  been  built still  later. 
Even  so,  the  intensity  of  the  quarreling  stemmed  from  eco-
nomic rather  than  personality factors.  The decisions of the Con-
servatives  directly  affected  their  pocketbooks  and  limited  their 
choices,  and  the  Reform group  benefitted  more  than  financially 
from  its  subsidy.  Not  only  was  it  able  to  hire  a  full-time  rabbi 
and build as  quickly as  the Conservatives,  even  though  its  mem-
bership was much smaller,  but its greater freedom  from  financial 
worries shortened and tempered the definitional struggles. 

If speed  and  effectiveness  of organization  are  maximal values, 
then  External  and  planned  formation  is  obviously  most  desir-
able;  if democracy and lay control are most  important,  then it is 
inappropriate.  Of course,  it is  perhaps  improper to  compare  the 
Protestant  and  Jewish  formation  processes,  because  the  Protes-
tant church plays a  lesser  role  than  the synagogue  in  the  lives of 
its  members.  The church  is  only a  provider of religious  services 
and one of many sources  of friends,  whereas  the synagogue  must 
meet many of the ethnic, emotional, and social needs of an entir~ 
subcommunity.  Furthermore,  only 
religious 
branches  (and  two  in  Levittown)  are  available  to  accommodate 
and sort  people differentiated  by age,  class,  and degree  of accul-
turation,  and  are  likely  to  produce  quite  heterogeneous  congre-
gations.  The  Protestants,  with  their  many  denominations,  can 
sort people into much more homogeneous groups,  making it rel-
atively easy for  the External  planners to anticipate their needs-
and  therefore,  to systematize  the  church  formation.  The  history 

three  Jewish 

•  82  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

of the  Methodist church  indicates that External  planning had to 
be responsive to membership wishes  if definitional struggles were 
to be minimized-but then, Protestant wishes were much simpler 
and more obvious than Jewish ones. 

Needless to say,  lay  Levittowners involved in  the organizing of 
their  religious  bodies did not  have  a  real  choice  between  Exter-
nal  and  Internal  formation.  Protestants  could,  of  course,  have 
opposed  the  prescriptions  of  the  External  agencies  and  their 
starter ministers,  but ministers are viewed  both as  moral  leaders 
and  as  experts  whose  proposals  are  not  easily  questioned.  Also, 
most  Protestants  were  not  inclined  to  be  critical;  neither  the 
structure nor the functions of the church were that vital  to them. 
The Jews had no choice at all, for when they came together, they 
immediately had to debate  far  more  basic  questions,  such as  the 
desirability  of  tradition  versus  acculturation,  and  ethnic  versus 
religious  identity-questions  which  few  Jews  had  even  thought 
about  before  they  moved  to  Levittown.  Although  some  of  the 
people involved in the six-weel( debate indicated that it had been 
a significant learning experience, most had considerable difficulty 
in coping with  the conflict and were happy when the split ended 
the arguments.8  Had they been able to choose,  they would  prob-
ably have opted for the responsive  External planning that created 
the  Protestant  and  Catholic  churches. 

CHURCH  AND COMMUNITY 

By  1961,  embryo  churches  were  functioning  in  Levittown,  and 
some  had  even  achieved  that  stability  one  finds  among  long-
established  congregations.  Most  Protestant  denominations  had 
either moved into their church or had a  building under construc-
tion, and Catholics, now running a parochial school, were already 
envisaging  a  second  parish.  Judging  from  church  membership 
rolls in  1g6o, about 35  per cent of  the nonfundamentalist Protes-
tant  families  had joined a  church,  and 40  per cent of this group 
attended  regularly  (at  least  three  times  a  month).  Undoubtedly, 
proportions  were  higher  among  Catholics,  whereas  among  the 
Jews, about 30 per cent had joined a synagogue by  1g6o,  but only 
about 8 per cent of these attended regularly. All the churches had 
established Sunday schools,  and  it seemed  that even among Prot-
estants many parents had joined in order to encourage their chil-
dren  to  learn  the  religious  and  ethical  tradition.  "I  don't  quite

believe  the  teachings,"  said one  Levittowner who became  active 
in a church for the first  time in his life, "but it's good for the kids 
to nave the background. Also,  it's  because  I  bought a  house,  and 
for becoming a  part of the community." The t=atio  of attendance 
to  enrollment  in  the  Protestant  Sunday  schools  was  50  per  cent 
higher than  in the church itself,  but among the Jews,  it was  830 
per cent  higher,  for  three  fourths  of  the  enrolled  children  were 
attending Sunday school regularly. 

Among  Catholics,  the  church  and  school  had  a  somewhat 
different  function-to  teach  children  discipline  and  restraint 
Working class  Catholics, as  well  as  a  number of the Irish middle 
class,  see  this  as  a  major  purpose  of  the  church,  which  perhaps 
helps  to explain why  Catholic families  oversubscribed  the school 
building fund.  A few  middle class families were restive about the 
narrowness of the parochial school curriculum, wanting more in-
dividual  attention,  less  rote learning, and  more  emphasis on  the 
arts, but the nuns decided what was to be taught and how.  Conse-
quently,  these  parents sent  their children  to  public schools. 

The churches  also  played  a  role  in  the  development  of  social 
life and in the sorting of residents; about 13  per cent of the inter-
view  respondents  reported  having  met  their  closest  friends  at 
church  or at  the  men's,  women's,  and couples'  clubs attached  to 
the  church,  but  the  churches  did  not  stress  social  programs  to 
attract  members.  The  sorting  function  was  further  encouraged 
by  providing  services  in  a  range  of  orthodoxy  so  that  people  of 
similarly intensive religious concern would be at church together 
and no one would  feel  excluded.  Episcopalians  held a  High ser-
vice  early  on  Sunday  morning and a  Low  one  later,  avoiding  a 
decision  whether  the  church  should  be  High  or  Low;  the  Con-
servative synagogue conducted Friday night services with a  mini-
mum of Hebrew, added more on Saturday mornings, and offered 
daily worship for  Orthodox Jews;  and fundamentalist  Protestant 
churches  held  Sunday  and  Wednesday  night  prayer  meetings 
open only to full members. 

Despite  normal  class  differences  among  denominations,  there 
was no class hierarchy of churches, at least not by  1961. The Pres-
byterian  and  Episcopalian  churches,  which  are  often  high-status 
denominations in America, did not have this reputation in Levit-
town.  At  this  stage  in  the  town's  history,  there was  little  oppor-
tunity to make status judgments about the churches, for they had 
not yet  played a  significant role in community life and none had 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

a  monopoly,  or  even  a  plurality,  of  community  leaders  among 
their  members.  Indeed,  if  a  church  had  special  prestige,  it was 
based  on  a  large  congregation,  an  attractive  building,  and  the 
pastor's  role  in  Levittown.  By  these  criteria,  the  Episcopalian 
church ranked lower than  some  others,  if  only  because its minis-
ter  was  older  and  less  active  in  Levittown  affairs  than  his  col-
leagues. The Methodist church was  probably at the bottom of the 
status hierarchy,  for  its  building was considered  ugly,  it had  per-
mitted Levitt to build a gas  station next door,  it was known  to be 
undergoing considerable  turmoil  within  the  congregation,  and 
its first  minister was  openly anti-Catholic.' 

Churches were  formally  distinct from  other community activ-
ities,  although ministers  blessed  (and spoke  at)  community func-
tions.10  People  active  in  church  organizations  were  frequently 
busy in secular groups, and vice versa,  for someone with a reputa-
tion  for  community activity  could  hardly  escape  being asked  by 
his  or her minister to  take  a  leading role  in church affairs.  As  a 
result,  there  was  some  relation  between  the  church  and  the 
secular  community;  and,  of  course,  some  involvement  in  town 
politics--on  issues  such  as  opening  the  township  to  liquor sales 
and  bingo games  and,  for  the  Catholics,  on  the  budget  for  the 
public schools. 

Relations among individual  churches were limited but largely 
cordial.  After  the  initial  competition for  recruits,  the  Protestant 
ministers  formed  a  Ministerium,  held  a  few  joint  affairs,  ex-
changed ministers, and celebrated Reformation Sunday together. 
The Ministerium  also  played  a  significant  role  in  the  racial  in-
tegration of the community.  Fundamentalist churches stayed out 
of  the  Ministerium,  however,  and  relations  between  major  and 
minor Protestant ministers continued to be somewhat distant be· 
cause  of  the  early  struggle  for  members.  Competition  remained 
rife  only  among  the  Jews,  where  an  innovation  in  one  congre-
gation  was  usually  copied  by  the  other  shortly  afterwards.  The 
ministers  and  rabbis  tried  to  minimize differences  between  reli-
gions  and  worked  actively  to  squelch  community  religious  con-
flict  the moment it appeared, fighting charges of anti-Catholicism 
and anti-Semitism that arose once or twice in political campaigns. 
They did not have to dwell on religious harmony, however, for it 
was considered desirable by most residents. Many agreed with one 
Levittowner who said,  "Religious differences aren't important, as 
long  as  everyone  practices  what  he  preaches."  The  institutions 
acted  similarly,  and  the  public  schools  had  planned  Chanukah

celebrations  even  before  the  leaders  of  the  Jewish  community 
had asked for them. 

NOTES 

1.  ''Unchurched" is religious jargon to describe people who said they 

had not belonged  to  a  church  in  their  previous  residence. 

2.  The third unplanned and Unintended church was  the  Unitarian, 
organized  because  the  nearest  congregation  was  in  Philadelphia. 
The Levittown Unitarian church eventually served all of Burling-
ton County. 

3·  My  study of the origin of the synagogues  was  more detailed  than 
that  of  the  organization  of  other  churches,  because  I  had  previ-
ously studied the beginnings of a Jewish subcommunity in another 
suburban  new  town  and  was  curious  to  compare  the  two.  The 
earlier study  is  reported in  Gans  (1951,  1957),  and more  fully  in 
Gans (1958). 

4·  A  decade earlier the rise  of Conservatism was  described  by Sklare 
as a congregationally led revolt against the  rabbinical domination 
of Orthodoxy. 

5·  This followed  exactly  the  pattern I  had observed  in  Park  Forest, 
where  I  described  in  detail  the change  from  an  adult-oriented  to 
a  child-oriented Jewish  religion.  See  Gans  (1958),  pp.  214-221. 
6.  Above-average  Jewish  organizational  activity  and  minimal  syna-
gogue  attendance  were  also  reported  in  a  study  of  Levittown, 
Pennsylvania, in its early years.  See Jahoda et al.,  pp.  95-96. 

7·  This is  close  to  the  national  estimate  that half of America's Jews 

belong  to  synagogues. 

8.  The  researcher  has  different  preferences.  I  sat  in  on  all  of  the 
meetings  during  the  historic  six  weeks  and  found  them  very  ex-
citing  to  study.  Indeed,  observing  the  Jewish  community  was 
never  boring,  for  meetings  of  both  synagogues  and  Jewish  or-
ganizations  always  produced  more  participation  and  argument 
from  the  floor  than  those  of  Christian  and  secular  nonpolitical 
groups-where  the  decisions  of  leaders  were  usually  accepted 
without  protest  and  the  routine  was  cut  and  dried. 

9·  Although  no  one  paid  much  attention  to  them,  some  of  the  tra-
ditional  ethnic differences  remained;  German  names  were  prom-
inent in  the  Lutheran church  and  only  slightly  Jess  so  than  Irish 
ones in  the  Catholic parish.  Italians maintained  their  traditional 
lack  of  interest  in  church  activities  except  for  Mass,  although 
some  with  non-Italian  spouses  were  involved  in  church  affairs. 
10.  Levittown  unconsciously  adopted  the  tripartite division  of Amer-
ican religion,  and  pains were  taken  at  all  community  ceremonies 
to include  benedictions by  a  minister,  a  priest,  and a  rabbi.  Only 
at Township Committee meeting benedictions was any effort made 
to use ministers  from  all  Protestant denominations as  well.

THE  NEW  SCHOOL  SYSTEM 

D

D 

WHEN  THE  FIRST  LEVITTOWNERS  MOVED  IN  THEY  KNEW  THAT  THE 
school  was ready,  but they knew nothing about what their child-
ren  would  be  taught  or  by whom.  Questionnaire  data  collected 
before  they  came  indicated  that  they  were  not  concerned;  they 
were  sure  that  the  new  schools  would  be as  satisfactory  as  their 
new neighbors. As  I noted in Chapter One, the builder had hired 
a  national  consulting  firm  to  develop  the  physical  plan  for  the 
new  school  system.  This firm,  having  no  parent or student  con-
stituency  for  whom  to  plan,  developed  a  standard  architectural 
program  adaptable  to whatever  curriculum would  eventually be 
created and left  the determination  of  that curriculum  up  to  the 
local  Board of Education. The board, a  group  of elected,  unpaid 
residents  then  running  Willingboro's  lone  school,  was  also  re-
strained by the absence of a  constituency, and one of its members 
later reported  that  "since  we  had  no  Levittowners  yet,  we  tried 
to give  them a  plan  for  the  finest  school  system  in  the  county." 
They decided  that  this system would  be  best achieved  by giving 
the responsibility for course  content,  teaching methods, and staff 
recruitment  to  the county superintendent of  schools. 

Since  that  official  was  by  state  law  also  head  of  the  township 
school,  the  board  was  familiar  with  his  ideas  and  methods  and 
trusted  him  to  design  a  school  system  it  would  find  acceptable. 
Indeed, its members were pleased that after the Ford Foundation 
plan could not be funded,  the builder expressed no further desire 
to  bring  in  an  outsider;  they  were  even  more  pleased  that  the 
county superintendent was  very  much  interested  in  establishing 

•  86  • 

The  New  School  System 

the  new  system.  Shortly  before  Levittown  was  opened  for  oc-
cupancy, he became its first  Superintendent of Schools.  Although 
much  of  the  plan  was  fixed  by  state  and  county  legislation  and 
administrative  regulations,  the  superintendent  had  some  leeway 
on course content and was free  to hire his own staff;  most impor-
tant,  he  could  determine· the  priorities  to  be  given  to  bright, 
average,  and slow students. As  a  result,  the school  system  was ini-
tially shaped by the superintendent's own goals. 

The  county  superintendent  had  been  in  office  for  about  ten 
years;  before that  he  had headed the schools  in  one of the larger 
towns  in  the  county.  The  system  he  developed  in  Levittown, 
however,  reflected  less  his adult experience  than  his  background 
and  student  years.  An  Irish  Catholic  of  lower  middle  class  ori-
gins,  he  was  personally  tom  between  enforcing  discipline  to 
maintain  traditional  restrictiveness  and  permitting  more  free-
dom to encourage expansiveness and individual development. He 
had been taught by rote, and had evidently suffered considerably 
at the hands of incompetent and petty teachers who punished for 
the slightest infractions of rules.  Nothing was  more  important to 
him than to liberate  the new generation  from  these  bonds.  Like 
many  Levittowners  he  wanted  the  children  to  grow  up  under 
better conditions  than  he  had  experienced.  He was  not  in  favor 
of progressive  education,  which struck  him as  totally  permissive, 
but  sought  to  combine  what  he  called  "the  teaching  of  tradi-
tional  skills  with  individual  treatment  of  the  children."  Hard-
and-fast course outlines would  be replaced  by  projects,  and  high 
school  students  would  be  free  to  choose  their  own  courses,  al-
though they would be closely advised by guidance counselors and 
held  responsible  for  their choices  by  a  strict grading  policy. 

Reading  was  to  him  the  most  important  of  the  traditional 
skills,  and  he  planned a  comprehensive  elementary  school  read-
ing program complementary to other coursework.  Its aim  was  to 
teach children to read well, but-equally important-at their own 
grade level.  When he interviewed a  prospective teacher,  he asked 
what  the  teacher  would  do  if  a  child  in  the  second  grade  had 
finished  the  second-grade  reader.  Candidates  who  suggested  a 
supplementary  second-grade  reader  were  considered  for  a  job; 
those who suggested  a  third-grade  reader  were  not.  As  the  read-
ing  expert  whom  he  later  hired  to  run  the  program  pointed 
out,  "A sixth-grade  child  should  not  get  seventh-grade  reading; 
that would  get  him  into adolescent  reading  . . .  a  child  should 

•  88  • 

not start reading too quickly  • 
away from him." 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

that would take his childhood 

Because  the  superintendent had  spent his  life  in  rural  educa-
tion,  he was  intensely concerned with average  students, retarded 
children, and slow learners. Although he realized that many of to-
day's  high  school  graduates would  go  to college,  the  colleges  he 
had  in  mind  were  not  Ivy  League  types,  but  state  schools  and 
small private colleges in New Jersey and adjoining states-schools 
like  the one he had attended.  He determined that,  in Levittown, 
the  public  school  system  would  devote  extra  energies  and  its 
additional  resources  to  the  retarded,  with  lowest  priority  given 
bright students.  Not only did he feel  that  the latter needed little 
help-much  less  than  retarded  students-but  he  found  their 
motives  and  their  behavior  undesirable.  In  his  view  they  were 
pushed  too  hard  by  their  parents,  who  wanted  them  to advance 
beyond  grade  level,  and  they  were  often  a  burden  to  teachers, 
especially if parents demanded too much individual attention "to 
make  sure  that  they  all  get  college  scholarships."  An  overem-
phasis on college preparation in the curriculum would ignore, he 
said,  "the great unwashed  who can't go  to college;  the girls  who 
become typists."  In line with his own lower middle class outlook, 
he  insisted  that  Levittown  would not copy  Brookline and Scars-
dale, and rejected such "Brookline ideas" as  teaching foreign lan-
guages  in  elementary  schools  and  allowing  liberal  skipping  of 
grades.  He liked to poke fun at a  neighboring upper middle class 
community whose  school  system  prided  itself on a  high  percent-
age  of college  scholarships,  arguing that it ought to  pay more at-
tention  to athletics so  that average students could obtain scholar-
ships.  This  justified  his  advocacy  of  varsity  sports,  although  he 
also wanted to bring county athletic leadership to Levittown and 
end the virtual monopoly of county championships that had been 
held  by  a  predominantly  working  class  community  for  many 
years. 

Rather  naturally,  the  superintendent  selected  assistants  who 
agreed  with  his  basic  philosophy.  The  elementary  schools  were 
assigned  to  a  veteran  county  educator  who  shared  the  superin-
tendent's preoccupation with discipline.  Known as  a "starter," he 
was  an energetic man  who thrived on  the round-the-clock  job of 
opening new  schools.  He  too  said  publicly and more  than  once, 
"I  won't  stand  for  a  Brookline  education,"  and  reinforced  the 
emphasis  on  the  average  student  by  rejecting  IQ  tests  and  aca-

The  New  School  System 

•  Bg  • 

demic competition of any kind,  whether among parents or chil-
dren. He also believed that if the school staff took the initiative in 
shaping the school system,  it could set standards which would be 
observed by students and parents alike. On the first day of school, 
he  welcomed  his  charges  at  the  front  door  and  laid  down  his 
rules.  Likewise,  he  personally  initiated  the  organization  of  a 
PTA, choosing it because  its  bylaws demanded support of school 
policy  and  moving  quickly  to  prevent  parents  from  organizing 
home-and-school  groups  which  could  question  it.  Moreover,  he 
personally recruited the actual  PTA founders  from  people he al-
ready  knew  and  trusted,  taking strangers only  if he  could check 
with  their  previous  communities  on  their  loyalty  to  the  school 
system.  He  also  demanded  that  his  teachers  "belong  to  the  sys-
tem." Teachers were  instructed to pay close attention to parents, 
for  dissatisfied  parents  would  create  pressure  groups,  and  these 
the  elementary  school  official  described  as  "cancers."  His  self-
righteous  authoritarianism  was  overlaid  by  an  expansive  ideal-
ism,  that he or anyone else could do what he wanted provided he 
wanted it badly enough.  This viewpoint not only served as  a ra-
tionalization for his methods, but also blinded him to the difficul-
ties  of his  task,  making  him  an  efficient  starter and  encouraging 
the  beginnings  of a  common  "school  culture"  in  all  the  schools 
he set up. 

For  the  first  year,  Levittown's  high  school  students  were 
farmed  out  to  other  communities,  but  in  1959,  when  it  came 
time  to  plan  a  local  high  school,  the  superintendent  selected  a 
principal  who  was  similarly  seeking  to  balance  discipline  and 
freedom.  Although  he came  from  a  school  where  So  per cent of 
the graduates  went on  to college,  he looked forward  to  being in 
Levittown,  where  preliminary  estimates  showed  that  no  more 
than  half  would  continue  their  education.  He  too  argued  that 
average  students were  being "robbed"  by  too  much  curriculum 
emphasis  on  college  preparation,  and  he  also  resented  the  de-
mands  of  "college  prep  students,  who  give  you  a  harder  time." 
He wanted to reduce the status hierarchy built into the academic, 
commercial,  and general  (a  euphemism  for  vocational)  divisions 
in the country high schools; he hoped that by permitting students 
do  choose  courses  in  all  of  them,  college  prep  students  would 
come  into  more  contact with  the  business  trainees  and  the  gen-
eral division students. He had a  genuine interest in the last,  who 
he  felt  were  being  neglected  because  of  inferior  or nonexistent 

•  go  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

vocational  courses  and  were  ostracized  by  their  fellow  students. 
As  it  turned out,  however,  not all  Levittowners shared the prin-
cipal's  and  superintendent's  priorities  and  their  belief  in  com-
pensatory support for  the intellectually disadvantaged. 

THE DEFINITIONAL STRUGGLES 

Voluntary associations and churches, being private agencies with 
sorting  functions,  could  end definitional  struggles  by  extruding 
people with divergent views.  The school  system,  however, like all 
public agencies served  the entire community and had  to  provide 
for  its diverse  demands within a  single institution. As  a  result,  it 
was soon embroiled in definitional struggles aimed at revising the 
superintendent's original goals. 

When  the  Levittowners  arrived,  they  were  delighted  that  the 
first  elementary  school  was  open  on  schedule,  and  were  pleased 
with  the  new,  modern  facilities  and  the  young,  energetic  teach-
ers.  They  seemed  satisfied  with  their  children's  performance, 
joined  the  PTA and  crowded  its  meetings,  and  even  helped  the 
schools  by  working  in  a  variety  of  PTA  fund  raising and  other 
projects.  Some  Catholics felt  that  the public school  was  lax-too 
much  "play" and not enough discipline-and these  parents (like 
most  other  Catholics)  enrolled  their  children  in  the  parochial 
school as soon  as  it opened.  Other parents may have been uneasy 
about one or another aspect of the  program,  but they decided to 
be patient with  the new system, arguing that "it was  too early  to 
heckle." As  a result, the administrators and teachers received very 
little criticism during the first  two years--or for that matter, little 
feedback  of  any  kind.  Although  the  principals  maintained  an 
open-door policy so  that parents could air complaints at any time, 
relatively few  did so.  One man, who had run  two  Levittown  ele-
mentary schools,  reported that the only curriculum complaint he 
ever  received  came  from  a  well-educated  mother  who  wanted 
more  work  for  her  talented  daughter.  What  complaints  there 
were  concerned  the  lunch  schedule  and  overly severe  discipline. 
On  one occasion,  when  a  teacher  had  a  near-breakdown  in  class 
and upset many children to tears, almost every  parent turned out 
that  night  at  the  school  board  meeting  to  protest.  Beyond  that, 
most  parents  seemed  content  to  leave  education  to  the  school, 
assuming that the  teachers knew best what was good for  the chil-
dren. 

The  New  School  System 

•  91  • 

Some  of the  plans  made  by  the  superintendent and  his  associ-
ates had to be changed to respond  to unexpected conditions. The 
elementary  schools  functioned  pretty  much  as  their  starter  in-
tended-but  then  their  students  were  a  captive  audience,  too 
young to make choices or to object to adult demands. At first  the 
parents,  too,  were  pleased  with  him,  particularly since  he  spoke 
to  them  idealistically,  well,  and  often,  never forgetting  to  praise 
their  children.  Once  all  the  schools  had  been  started,  however, 
and a routine had been established,  his flowery  speeches  began  to 
grate, especiall')t on  parents and teachers who disliked his oppres-
sive  methods and  his  way  of using rhetoric  to  avoid  confronting 
disagreement.  He resigned  before opposition  had a  chance to  be-
come visible and widespread. 

When it came to  the organization of the high school,  the initial 
plans  had  to  be adapted  to  the diversity  and  choice-making abil-
ity  of  the  students.  Reducing  the  barriers  between  the  three  di-
visions assumed a  fairly  equal  proportion of choices  in  each,  but 
so per cent of the students opted for  the academic track, and gen-
eral  students  were  a  small  minority.  Consequently,  the  school 
had  to  emphasize  "college  prep"  after  all,  and even  initiated an 
honors  program, but could not mount a  vocational  program. To 
prevent  the  possibility  that  the  general  students  might  become 
resentful and cause trouble, the principal tried to make them feel 
part of  the  school  through  extracurricular activities  and  sought, 
unsuccessfully,  to  have  one  elected  as  a  student  council  officer. 
Even  so,  he  could  not  counteract  their  hostility,  and  later  they 
ranked high among the dropouts and serious delinquents. 

Plans  to  give  all  students  more  freedom  of course  choice  and 
class  attendance  were  frustrated  by  the  poor  marks  some  had 
earned  while  attending  neighboring  schools  the  year  before. 
Evidently treated as  unwelcome outsiders, one third had to make 
up work  that summer,  and their poor records,  as  well  as  the  ini-
tial  stirrings  of juvenile delinquency just before  the high school 
opened,  frightened  the  school  board  members.  Teenage  vandal-
ism  and delinquency had  been  unknown  in  the  township  previ-
ously, largely because its few adolescents had had to go elsewhere 
for  recreation.  Not knowing what  to expect  from  the  Levittown 
youngsters,  the  board  and  the  administration  were  reluctant  to 
trust their new charges, and because they were then engaged in a 
struggle  with  upper  middle  class  parents  on  another  issue,  they 
were  not  eager  to  initiate  freedoms  that  might  well  engender 

•  92  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

protests  from  restrictive  parents.  Instead,  the  high  school  prin-
cipal  sought  to  instill  more  "school  spirit,"  particularly  by  en-
couraging  the  immediate  formation  of  a  varsity  football  team. 
Even  though  he  believed  it  to  be  premature,  he  gave  in  to  the 
demands of some residents and the wishes  of the superintendent, 
hopeful  that  it would make  for  a  peaceful  and cooperative rela-
tionship  with  the  student  body.  Needless  to  say,  this  was  too 
much  to  expect of a  football  team,  and although students main-
tained  order-except for  a  rash  of  bomb  scares  one spring-the 
desired  feeling  of cooperation  and  trust was  not achieved in the 
early years. 

The  Revolt of the  Upper  Middle  Class 

Highly  educated  Levittowners  with  bright  children  did  not 
take long to realize that the new school  was not giving their chil-
dren  high  priority.  There were  relatively few  such  parents,  and 
those  who  could  afford  it  transferred  their  children  to  nearby 
private  schools,  but these  did  not  provide  kindergartens. Just as 
the  superintendent  had  augured,  the  parents  began  to  "cause 
trouble" soon after they arrived in Levittown. 

In  the  spring  of  1959.  the  township  Board  of  Education  an-
nounced  that  in  congruence  with  state  Board  of  Education 
policy,  it  would  only  admit  children  into  kindergarten  if  they 
had reached the age  of five  by October  1.  This policy was at once 
questioned  by  a  couple  of  lower  middle  class  parents  with  chil-
dren  born  a  few  days  after  the  cut-off  date,  but  school  officials 
persuaded  them of  the wisdom  of the policy.  At the next school 
board  meeting,  however,  the  issue  was  reopened  by  two  upper 
middle  class  professionals,  and  before  long,  they  presented  the 
board with a  petition signed  by  170  parents  asking for  a  change 
in  the  cut-off  date  to  December  31.  When  that  petition  was  re-
jected,  they  collected  200  more  names,  and  with  it a  small  but 
vocal group who kept the issue alive for several months. 

The board members had never before been confronted with a 
petition and reacted with resentment and fear.  "If we  listened to 
all  the  wishes,"  one  said,  "there  would  be government  by  peti-
tion and  that is  not desirable."  Protests would cast aspersions on 
them and mean longer working hours to deal  with the protests as 
well.  They  wanted  neither,  particularly  since  they  knew  that 
they would lose  their positions to  Levittowners as  soon as  the lat-
ter had fulfilled  the two-year residence requirement. A change in

the cut-off date would bring more children into schools that were 
already full,  violate state policy as  well as  the wishes  of the super-
intendent, and force  the board members to support a  policy they 
themselves considered undesirable. The questions now at issue-
responsiveness  to  the constituents,  the justification of local  inno-
vation  in  county  tradition,  and  the  role  of  the  school  in  the 
community-would  come  up  again  and  again  in  the  years  to 
come. 

The proponents of the date change were almost all  upper mid-
dle  class  people,  eager  to  get  their  children  into  school,  the 
sooner  to  qualify  for  college  competition.  The  board  members 
and  the  school  staff  believed,  however,  that children  should  not 
be asked  to sacrifice  their childhood or jeopardize their "natural" 
social  adjustment.  Indeed,  some  of  them felt  that a child  should 
not enter  the first  grade until  he was  seven.  The older he  was  at 
the  time  of graduation,  the  more  mature  he  would  be,  and  the 
more  likely  to  obtain  a  good  job.  These  were  overwhelmingly 
lower  middle  class  people,  concerned  only  that  the  children 
would get good white collar jobs once  they finished  their school-
ing.  To  them,  family  came  before  school;  in  fact,  they  accused 
the  proponents of  the date change of wanting their children out 
of the  house and of using the school  as  a  baby-sitter.  They could 
not understand that the proponents were already preparing their 
youngsters for professional careers. 

The proponents of change were cosmopolitans and were  think-
ing  in  terms  of  the  nationwide  competition  for  admission  to 
"name" universities. The board members and the school  staff,  on 
the other hand, had spent all  their Jives  in New Jersey,  and  their 
allegiance was  to the township, the county, and the local colleges. 
Finally,  the  proponents  fervently  advocated  innovation  and  ar-
gued that in a new community a fresh start should be made while 
conditions were  still  propitious--at the beginning, with consum-
mate speed,  and  on  the  basis  of expert advice.  The board  mem-
bers  retorted  that  they  had  no  time  for  innovation,  having 
enough  to do  just  to  get  the routine  established,  and  besides,  as 
one pointed out, "The community is  not like a Cadillac in which 
everything is  finished  before it comes out of the factory;  it has  to 
develop and  the  people  have  to  put  the  finishing  touches  on  it 
themselves." 

In response  to  the  board's call  for  more  facts,  the  proponents 
consulted  educational  psychologists  all  over  the  East  Coast  and 

•  94  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

superintendents of  school  systems  with  late cut-off  dates.  Agree-
ing  that  age  was  an  arbitrary  criterion  for  cut-off,  they  recom-
mended  a  testing  program  by which  children  under  five  before 
December  31  would  be  admitted  to  the  kindergarten  upon  a 
good showing on  tests.  To their amazement,  however,  the board 
rejected  the  proposal.  It  referred  to  other  expert  opinion  on 
which  state  policy  had  been  based,  found studies which claimed 
that  children's  eyes  would  be  damaged  permanently  if  they 
started to read before age six or even eight, and sloughed off  ex-
perience  from  schools  in  high-status  communities.  "We  are  not 
Brookline,"  said  one  school  official,  "and  it cannot  serve  as  our 
guide."  They rejected  tests  as  well,  not only because  they would 
force  children to compete against each other but because of their 
political  consequences.  Anger  from  parents  whose  child  had 
failed  the test by a  percentage point would be more intense than 
that generated by a  birthday that came a day after the cut-off. But 
even as  the board members tried to counter facts with other facts 
and turn the debate back to opinions which could not be argued 
so  easily,  they  recognized  a  genuine  community  protest.  The 
township  government  had  recently  rejected  petitions  on  two 
issues  raised  by  the  newcomers  and  had roused  the  ire  of many 
Levittowners.  Even  though  they  were  elected  on  a  nonpartisan 
basis,  the  school  board  members  were  Republicans,  and  yet  an-
other  rebuff could  only  help  the  Democratic  party.  Conversely, 
they  could  not  bring  themselves  to  give  in  to  "government  by 
petition" or to cross  professional  educators.  Indeed,  the staff  per-
suaded  the  board  that  "they  [the  proponents]  are  laymen;  they 
don't  really  know  what  it's  all  about,"  but  an  argument  that 
might  have  intimidated  most  Levittowners  did  not  impress  the 
proponents,  some  of  whom  were  better  educated  and  of  higher 
occupational status than the school administration. 

Caught in  the middle,  the  board stalled,  hoping that  the con-
troversy  would  abate  over  the  summer.  Although  this  did  not 
happen,  the stalling paid  off,  for  as  new  purchasers streamed  in, 
the lack of room for additional kindergartens served as an excuse 
to  turn  the  proponents down  without passing on  the validity of 
their demands.  Even  then, another wave of pressure might  have 
led to a  reversal,  particularly after the board met with  the Levitt 
officials  to seek their advice-and learned that they had no objec-
tion  to  the  change-but  also  because  all  along  the  board  had 
assumed  that  all  Levittowners  agreed  with  the  proponents  and 

The  New  School  System 

•  95  • 

might decide to petition en masse.  Now, one board member who 
was  active  in  the community and sat  on  other  township  boards, 
decided  to sample  Levittown opinion.  To his surprise,  he found 
that  many  Levittowners  shared  his  own  feeling  that  children 
should  be  kept  at home  as  long as  possible  and  that  the  propo-
nents  were  most  likely  only a  small  minority.  Once  he commu-
nicated  this  to  the  board,  it felt  strong enough  to  resist  further 
pressure. 

The  long  struggle  had  unified  the  protesting  parents  and,  a 
week after their defeat,  they organized a  Citizens' Committee for 
Better Schools, later renamed the Citizens' Association for  Public 
Schools  (C.A.P.S.),  because  some  members  felt  the  reference  to 
"better schools"  might  cast  aspersions  on  the  Levittown  system 
that  would  cost  the group  community support.  Once organized, 
C.A.P.S.  did  not  have  to.wait  long for  a  new  issue  on  which  to 
oppose the school board: overcrowding and class size. 

The schools had been planned on  the basis of population data 
collected  in  Levittown,  Pennsylvania,  to  permit classes  of  25-30 
pupils. But the new Levittown had attracted a  higher proportion 
of  larger  families  with  school-age  children,  and  the  parochial 
school would not take as many Catholic students as had originally 
been  expected.  As  a  result,  classes  in  the  second  neighborhood 
elementary  school  grew  to  35  or  more.  Levitt  altered  his  con· 
struction  plans  to  build  more  four-bedroom  and  fewer  three-
bedroom houses  in newer  "parks,"  but he was  unwilling to  plan 
more classrooms  in  the schools  for  these neighborhoods,  arguing 
that  the  overcrowding  would  be  temporary  and  assuming  that 
there  would  be  no objection  to  bigger classes  in  the  meantime. 
C.A.P.S., supported by the neighborhood PTA, asked that classes 
be  restored  to  their  original  size  by  busing  the  overflow  to  the 
first  school  (which  served  a  smaller  neighborhood).  However, 
the superintendent, suspecting that the two organizations did not 
reflect  majority  opinion,  conducted  an  attitude  survey,  asking 
parents  whether  they  preferred  busing  or  larger  classes. 1  Three 
fourths  of  parents  responding  favored  larger  classes,  and  the 
C.A.P.S. proposal was rejected. 2 

The Attack on the  School  Budget 

After this defeat, C.A.P.S., expecting to be permanently at log-
gerheads  with  the  school  system,  started  to  draft  what  it 
considered  to  be a  more  desirable curriculum.  The superinten-

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

dent sought to reduce its antagonism, however, and asked several 
members  to  assist  him  on  school  board  work,  partly  to  coopt 
them,  partly  to  take  advantage  of  their  research  and  their  plan-
ning skills lacking in his own small staff.  In working together, the 
antagonists discovered some shared goals.  The superintendent ac-
tually supported  the C.A.P.S.'  desire  for  small classes,  and a  year 
later,  he  implemented  a  busing  plan  based  on  its  original  pro-
posal.  He also set up a  testing system  to enable children  to  enter 
kindergarten  before  the  age  of five  if  their parents requested  it. 
The sudden compatibility  was,  however,  primarily a  response 
to the development of a new and much stronger set of opponents 
to  the school  system:  Levittowners who demanded less  expensive 
schools devoted  to little more  than  basic  teaching functions,  and 
who  sought  to  prevent  the  establishment  of  additional  educa-
tional  services  which  both  the  administration  and  C.A.P.S  took 
for  granted  as  absolutely  necessary.  By  1g6o,  the  rising  school 
population and the hiring of auxiliary staff-for example, varsity 
coaches  and  a  school  psychologist--required  a  significant  in-
crease  in  the school  budget.  In Levittown, as  in most other small 
New Jersey communities,  this budget had to be approved by  the 
voters, and in February 1960, the first election in which a sizeable 
number  of  Levittowners  were  eligible  to  vote,  it  was  badly 
beaten.  Even  though  the  budget was  then  slightly cut,  and  even 
though Levitt was  then paying about 40 per cent of all municipal 
operating  expenditures,  the  tax  rate  rose  15  per  cent,  or  about 
$25 a year. 

When the new  tax bills went out in the summer of 1g6o, wide-
spread  grumbling  developed  about  school  expenditures,  too 
much  expansion  and  innovation,  and  the  high  salaries  of  the 
school  administration. To add fuel  to  the fire,  a  consultant hired 
by  the  Township  Committee  to  help reorganize  municipal  gov-
ernment predicted that taxes  in Levittown would  eventually rise 
from  about  $275  per  house  to  $645.  Opposition  to  the  rise  in 
school  taxes-which  accounted  for  about  three  quarters  of  the 
total  tax  bill--came  from  families  without  school-age  children 
and from  less  affluent  Levittowners who were  finding  the cost  of 
home  ownership  higher  than  expected.  The  most  vocal  attacks 
seemed to come from  Catholics,  who not only had lower incomes 
and more children  than Protestant and Jewish  Levittowners,  but 
Mho were at that time also  being asked to fund  the building of a 
llftochial school. 

The  New  School  System 

•  97  • 

In  the  fall  of  1960  the  first  Levittowners  became  eligible  to 
run  for  the  Board  of  Education,  and  leading  Catholics  in  the 
Democratic  party-whose  leadership was  large~y Catholic  to  be-
gin  with-began  to  look  for  candidates  for  the  1961  board  elec-
tion  who  would  vote  for  lower  school  budgets.  As  a  result, 
C.A.P.S. rallied behind the school board and superintendent and, 
by  the  beginning of  1961,  it had  emerged  as  their  principal  de-
fender  in  the  community.  The  proposed  budget  for  the  1961-
1962 school year was again higher than the previous one, and be-
cause  Levitt  could  no  longer  afford  to  subsidize  school  opera-
tions,  except  in  new  neighborhoods not yet on  the  tax rolls,  an-
other  tax increase was  threatening.  Eventually,  it came  to about 
$wo  per  house,  a  33  per cent  increase  over  the  previous  year's 
tax bill. 

By  county  tradition,  school  board  elections  were  "above  poli-
tics"  and  enough  Levittowners  agreed,  thus  discouraging  the 
Democrats  from  forming  a  slate.  Shortly  before  the  mandatory 
public  hearing  on  the  budget  and  the  election,  however,  three 
anti-tax  candidates,  two  of  them  leaders  of  the  Holy  Name  So-
ciety,  were  being  talked  up by many  Levittowners as  a  so-called 
"Catholic  slate."  The  year  before,  the  public  hearing  had  at-
tracted  only  a  handful  of  people,  but  in  February  1961,  more 
than  6oo,  the  largest  crowd  of  Levittowners  ever  to  meet  to-
gether,  jammed the auditorium in an  angry  mood  to  protest the 
proposed  budget.  The complaints  of  the  previous  year  were  re-
peated,  and  there  was  violent  criticism  of  the  superintendent's 
$18,ooo salary and a  newly suggested administrative post for  cur-
riculum planning. A group of engineers, constituting a  Commit-
tee  for  Efficient  Schools,  argued that all  the school  really needed 
was  teachers  and  that volunteers from  the community could  ad-
minister  and  plan.  Others  in  attendance  attacked  the  classroom 
size  policy,  pointing out that  the parochial school  was  providing 
adequate  education with  6o  children  per class;  and a  few  people 
even  objected  to  teachers' salaries,  the highest of which-for ten 
years'  experience-were  then approaching  the  community's  me-
dian income of $7 soo.  The opposition  to  teachers'  salaries came 
largely  from  a  handful  of  working  class  Levittowners  who  had 
never before encountered teachers earning more than they.  Most 
Levittowners  were  careful  not lo  object  to  teachers'  pay,  how-
ever,  and reserved  their disapproval  for  "administrators." 

The  meeting  was  extremely  bitter,  with  angry  charges  and 

•  !J8  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

exaggerated  claims  freely  traded.  The  conflict  was  clearly  be-
tween  the  haves  and  the  have-nots,  for  when  one  lone  budget 
supporter ended his speech,  he was asked how much he was  earn-
ing.  There  was  also  conflict,  as  in  the voluntary associations,  be-
tween  the  (few)  advocates  of  rapid  growth  who  wanted  a  fully 
staffed  school  system  now}  and  the 
(many)  proponents  of 
gradual  maturation,  although  they  were  only rationalizing their 
demand for tax reduction. 

to  be 

The  protesting  Levittowners  resented  particularly  what  they 
considered 
taxation  without  representation.  Despite 
C.A.P.S. suggestions that the school board  improve its "public re-
lations," the budget was printed only in the classified advertising 
pages  of the two county newspapers,  as  required  py law-where, 
of course,  few  people saw  it.  Since attendance at  board  meetings 
had  been  minimal and  the school  board still  had not become  ac-
quainted  with  many  Levittowners,  they  did  not  know  how  to 
communicate  with  or  represent  their  new  constituents.  At  the 
public hearing itself,  the board again objected to government by 
protest  and  petition,  reinforcing  the  Levittowners'  feeling  that 
they  lacked  control  over  their  own  elected  officials.  As  a  result, 
the  budget  was  voted  down  overwhelmingly  at  the  election, 
and the so-called Catholic slate replaced three of the old residents 
on  the  nine-man  school  board.  Subsequent  interviews  showed 
that  blue  collar  and  lowest  income  respondents  rejected  the 
budget in  largest numbers.  Unexpectedly,  the  most  poorly  edu-
cated parents  were  more  favorable  than  high  school  and  college 
graduates, as  were mothers--not fathers-of school-age  children, 
and go  per cent of the Catholics turned down the budget as com-
pared to 67  per cent of the Jews. 

Once  Levittowners had achieved even minority repre~entation 
on  the school  board,  the community's anger abated.  In  1962,  the 
school  budget  rose  again,  and  the  voters  again  rejected  it,  but 
they  did  not  complain  when  the  school  board  refused  to  cut  it 
afterwards and levied another 15  per cent tax increase.  Moreover, 
the  voters  elected  to  the  board  two  C.A.P.S.  leaders  who  had 
campaigned strenuously as a  pro-budget slate,  although they did 
poorly  in  the  first  neighborhoods  and  obtained  their  winning 
margin  from  the  more  recently  settled  ones.  Thanks  to  rising 
house  prices,  the  newer  arrivals  were  somewhat  more  affluent; 
also,  having  come  to  Levittown  after  the  initial  tax  hikes,  they 

The  New  School  System 

•  99  • 

were  not  faced  with  so  precipitous  an  increase  in  monthly  pay-
ments. 

After  public  concern  over  the  budget  had  died  down,  the 
C.A.P.S.-administration  alliance  disintegrated.  The  main  source 
of  conflict  now  was  the  superintendent's  unwillingness  to  plan 
for  the  future  and  to  find  some  way  of dealing with  the growth 
needs  of  the  system  and  the  annual  budget  rejections  by  the 
voters.  Indeed,  the  superintendent was  too sluggish  even  for  the 
remaining old  residents  on  the  school  board who  had  originally 
appointed  him,  and  in  the  fall  of  1962,  they  joined  forces  with 
the  two  C.A.P.S.  members  in  asking  him  to  resign.  Old  differ-
ences with  C.A.P.S.  about what made for  a  good school,  and  the 
priorities for  serving bright, average,  and slow  students also  con-
tributed to the superintendent's downfall, as did his reluctance to 
improve  "public  relations."  Yet  these  factors  were  only  sympto-
matic  of a  more basic  problem-his inability to adapt  his  previ-
ously  rural  experience  to  the  wishes  of  the  suburbanites.  He 
could,  perhaps,  not have avoided antagonizing the minority who 
wanted  an  upper  middle  class  school  system  or  the  less  affluent 
Levittowners  who  demanded .economy  above  all  and  asked  him 
to provide what he considered inferior education, but he did not 
really  understand  even  the  majority  of  his  constituents.  In  a 
speech  to  the  National  Education  Association,  he  mischaracter-
ized  Levittowners as  "descendants of second  or third generation 
immigrants  whose  national  customs  and  mores  are  very  slowly 
discarded,"  and  compared  them  to  his  previous  rural  constit-
uents, whom he eulogized as  "descendants of early Colonial stock 
or  the  solid  conservative  descendants  of  the  European  farmer . 
.  .  .  As  our  farms  grow  into  neighborhoods,  we  [must]  provide 
American,  not  foreign,  education,"  he  said,  as  if  his  role  was  to 
Americanize the  Levittowners. 

Ironically, and despite his ethnic misinterpretation, he differed 
little from  the lower  middle  class  majority  in  Levittown,  and  it 
agreed with most of his teaching policies.  Indeed, the overall con-
sensus  between  him  and  most  parents  about  what  class  culture 
was  to  be  transmitted  by  the  school  system  had  enabled  him  to 
implement  his  substantive  educational  ideas  without  much  op-
position.  Conversely,  if  the  Ford  Foundation  scheme  for  an 
upper middle class school  system had been put into practice, and 
the  school  had  consequently  required  what  lower  middle  class

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

students  would  consider  excessive  learning demands,  they  prob-
ably  would  have  protested  to  their  parents,  who  in  turn  might 
have forced  the school  board to transform the system into a lower 
middle class institution. 

The  superintendent's  departure,  and  the  ability  of  the  two 
C.A.P.S.-affiliated  board  members  to  organize  a  coalition  that 
outvoted the advocates of economy, now encouraged the twosome 
to believe  that it could reorganize  the  school  system  closer  to  its 
wishes,  but this hope was  short-lived. The victory of  the C.A.P.S. 
members appeared certain when a liberal Pennsylvania educator, 
who shared many of their standards, was  found  to replace  the su-
perintendent. Shortly before he was to take office, however, Demo-
crats on the Township Council told him  they would fight any pol-
icies  that would result in higher taxes.  He decided  that  it would 
be  foolhardy to come  to Levittown to face  a continuous political 
battle,  and  resigned.  The  search  for  a  new  man  took  several 
months  but, eventually, a  more compatible New Jersey adminis-
trator  was  hired.  Meanwhile,  the  Democrats  then  in  control  of 
the  Township  Council  had  decided  that  the  traditional  taboo 
against  political  party  involvement  in  school  politics  was  less 
sacred to their constituents than lower  taxes,  and put pressure on 
the school  board for  budget cuts.  In  this  atmosphere,  C.A.P.S.'s 
short-lived  influence came  to an end at  the next school  election. 
After one of the C.A.P.S.-affiliated board members had left Levit-
town for a  better job in another state,  the remaining member be-
came  the  sole  target  for  attacks  on  "better schools"  and  higher 
taxes.  Although  the  newer  neighborhoods  provided  some  sup-
port,  she  trailed  behind the other candidates and the brief reign 
of the cosmopolitans was over. 

THE EVOLUTION  OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM 

Recurring  struggles  over  the  amount  and  allocation  of  school 
funds  did  not  prevent  the  rapid  development  of  a  functioning 
school  system  in  Levittown.  By September  1965,  more than Sooo 
students  were  attending  five  elementary  schools,  two  junior  (or 
middle)  ones,  and  a  high  school,  the  latter  built  entirely  from 
public  funds.  These  schools  included  all  the  curricular  and  ex-
tracurricular  accouterments  one  would  expect  in  a  modern 
middle  (but not upper middle)  class  suburb;  the education  they 
provided  would  prepare  the  students  for  about  the  same  white

collar,  technical,  and  subprofessional  jobs  held  by  their  parents 
and for  the  lower  middle  class  culture that  dominated  the com-
munity.  Perhaps  the  schools  favored  the  restrictive  subculture 
more  than  the  expansive;  the  course  offerings  were  quite  tradi-
tional, and there was none of the "life adjustment" and "learning 
to get along with  the group" approach that Whyte had found  in 
Park  Forest. 3  The  teachers  gave  their  students  individual  atten-
tion  and  demanded  neither  superior  intellectual  achievement 
nor oppressive memorizing. As a  result,  the dropout rate was  in· 
finitesimal,  and  about  50  per cent  of  the  graduates  enrolled  ii] 
college,  although  in  1963  a  third  of  them  chose  junior colleges 
and  teachers'  colleges,  and  only  5  per  cent  went  to  "name" 
schools.  It  was,  as  one  unhappy  C.A.P.S.  member  put  it,  "the 
school system  the community deserved."  Interviews conducted in 
1961  suggested,  however,  that  the majority was  pleased.  Seventy-
five  per cent of all  parents and  87  per cent of non-Catholic ones 
felt  their children were either learning better or about as  well  as 
in their previous community, and 75  per cent of  the parents con-
sidered  the Levittown system  superior  to  the  one  they  had  come 
from,  praising  it for  better teachers  and  higher  performance re-
quirements from  the children. 4 

A minority Catholic bloc had seemingly settled into the school 
board  and  opposed  many  majority  decisions,  but  the  conflict 
never  reached  the  intensity or  the longevity  that had  developed 
in  Levittown,  New York,  where a  large,  predominantly Catholic 
group fought  the budget and also accused  the system of Commu-
nist  leaning for  many  years. 6  Levittown,  New  Jersey  still  strug-
gled with an increasing school  population and rising budgets, re-
quiring a  6  per cent  tax  increase  in  1964  and  a  16  per cent  in-
crease in 1965. In addition, insufficient classroom space continued 
to  be a  problem,  possibly  requiring an  eventual  enlargement of 
the  elementary  schools.  However,  it  seemed  as  if  the  Levit-
towners  preferred larger classes  to  rising  taxes. 

Actually,  school  expenditures could not  have  been considered 
unreasonable;  in  1965,  they  amounted  to  $465  per student,  less 
than  in  all  but  two  of  the  seven  townships  surrounding  Levit-
town.  Even  taxes  were  not  exorbitant,  amounting  in  1965  to 
$425-$530,  depending  on  the  house  type.  The  actual  tax  rate 
was  only  about  8  per  cent  higher  than  in  1959,  and  what  had 
caused  the precipitous  tax  rise,  a  total of  122  per cent since  that 
year,  was  the  withdrawal  of  the  Levitt  subsidies  which  paid  for 

•  102  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

almost  half  of  all  municipal  expenditures  during  the  first  two 
years. 6  Some Levittowners were undoubtedly hard pressed  to pay 
the higher taxes,  especially on  top of increases  in the cost  of  liv-
ing  and  the  rising  expenses  of  maintaining  their  houses.  For 
many, however, it was not so much the money as  the idea of hav-
ing to pay for a school their children did not attend-and then to 
have  to fund  the parochial  school as well,  and  for  others, of hav-
ing to support a  system  with  more  "frills"  than  they  wanted  for 
their  children.  These  parents  were  essentially  objecting  to  a 
school  that taught  the culture of their more affluent and higher-
status neighbors, a culture which  they  neither wanted  to finance 
nor  to  have  their  children  adopt.  Since  education  is  supposedly 
not  only  above  politics  but also  classless,  the  class  conflict-for 
that is what it was-never came to the surface, but it pervaded the 
definitional  struggle  nevertheless. 

Even  so,  the less  affluent Catholic population was  not quite as 
threatened either financially or in terms of status as its equivalent 
on Long Island-where half the people were blue collar workers 
and  the cosmopolitan opposition,  as  well,  was  larger.  This prob-
ably  explains  why  the  panic,  the  anti-Communist  hysteria,  and 
the  witch-hunting  never  developed. 7  In  1963,  a  Birchite  group 
did attack the school  board for Communist sympathies but it re-
ceived  no  support  from  other  Levittowners  and  quickly  faded 
out of the picture. Dobriner describes Levittown, Long Island, as 
"bimodal"  in  class,  and  Catholic  blue  collar  anger  there  may 
have  been  heightened  by  relative  deprivation  vis-a-vis  a  single 
class  enemy,  whereas  Levittown,  New  Jersey,  was  more  "tri-
modal,"  and on some  issues,  working class  residents  found allies 
among lower middle class ones. The Long Island community was 
almost  ten  years  old  when  the  conflict  reached  its  peak,  and  it 
may also  be  that  the  relative  newness  and  the  concurrent  reser-
voir  of  residents'  patience  muted  it  in  the  New Jersey commu-
nity. 

NOTES 

1.  Despite  the  principal's  careful  screening  of  prospective  PTA  of-
ficers,  this PTA regularly criticized school policy and, at one point, 
even  proposed  secession  from  the  national  PTA  to  enable  it  to 
fight the school system. The proposal was  beaten by  pressure from

county  and  state  PTA leaders  and  the  lack  of  sufficient  support 
from  the  neighborhood membership. 

2.  My reanalysis of the survey suggested that parents who liked  their 
children's  teachers  opposed  busing;  those  who  disliked  them  fa-
vored it,  and class size was of lesser importance to  them.

THE  EMERGENCE  OF 
PARTY  POLITICS 

D 

D 

EVEN THOUGH THE FORMATION  OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM  WAS  MARKED 
by recurring conflict, the students were for all practical purposes a 
captive constituency, which limited the extent of the definitional 
struggles.  Municipal  government  represented  all  Levittowners, 
however,  and had to cope  with all  their diversities.  Nowhere was 
the origin  process  more  chaotic  than  among and  within  the  po-
litical  parties. 

When  Levitt  first  purchased  the  land,  Willingboro  was  gov-
erned  by  a  three-man  Township  Committee,  each  member 
elected  for  three  years,  and  by  an  appointed  township  solicitor 
who  drafted-and  often  suggested-legislation  and  supervised 
the  Committee's few  administrative and executive  tasks.  Levitt's 
arrival  did  not  immediately change  this  pattern.  He  built roads 
and other municipal  facilities,  the Township Committee's major 
function  being to review  the firm's  plans. 

Until  the  Levittowners  moved  in,  the  township  was  a  one-
party  community,  having  been  Republican  since  its  inception, 
and as  everybody knew everyone else,  there was  no need for  elec-
tion campaigns or even for  an active  local  party.  After  Levitt ar-
rived,  the  community  and  the  party  split  into  pro- and  anti-
Levitt factions,  the former headed by  the old elite,  the latter by a 
conservative  ex-New  Yorker  who  belonged  to  the  opposing  fac-
tion  in  the  county  Republican  party.  An  Episcopalian  of  Cath-
olic  birth  and a  public  relations  man  by  trade,  he  disagreed  on 

•

The  Emergence  of  Party  Politics 

•  105  • 

almost  every  issue  with  the  Methodist  and  Presbyterian  farmers 
on  the  other  side,  particularly  on  the  question  of  liquor,  he 
favoring a  wet community,  they a  dry one.  The newcomer soon 
came  to  support  Levitt,  but  his  other  differences  with  the  old 
elite remained, and were to  affect  Levittown politics for  the next 
two years, especially after he was chosen Mayor. 

By  the  time  the  Levittowners  came,  everyone  knew  that 
change  was  just  around  the  corner,  for  the  first  ones  would  be 
eligible  to  vote  in  the  April  1959  primary.  They  would  out-
number  the  old  residents  by  1960,  at  the  latest;  and  eventually 
they might, as  residents  of the largest  community  in  the county, 
dominate  its  politics  as  well.  No  one  realized  this  more  clearly 
than  four  young  Democratic  hopefuls,  all  previously  active  in 
county  politics--two as  Republicans--who were among the  first 
purchasers in Levittown.  Having known each other  before,  they 
caucused  quickly,  constituted  themselves  a  steering  committee, 
and in December organized the township's first  Democratic club. 
Shortly thereafter,  they began a  house-to-house survey to look for 
Democratic  voters  and  workers. 1  In  March  the  Republicans, 
spurred  on  by a  lone  Levittowner,  buried  the  factional  hatchets 
long  enough  to  organize  a  formal  Republican  club.  Both  clubs 
immediately  started  to  look  for  candidates  for  the  November 
Township  Committee  election,  but  neither  party  knew  what 
kind  of a  candidate  might appeal  to  the new  voters.  The Demo-
crats  used  survey  results,  and  judging  from  the  enthusiastic  re-
sponses  among  working  class  residents  (middle  class  ones  were 
likely  to call  themselves  independents),  they concluded he ought 
to  be a  "working man."  The  Republicans  knew  almost  nothing 
about the Levittowners, but the  Mayor's faction,  also considering 
them  to  be working class,  selected  a  Catholic  salesman,  whereas 
the old elite guessed  high  and  picked a  Protestant  Harvard  Law 
School  graduate.  Eventually,  both  these  prospective  candidates 
withdrew to avoid a  primary fight  and  the nomination went to a 
lower middle class Catholic insurance salesman. 

While  the  parties  were  readying  their  nominees  for  the  No-
vember  election,  the  Township  Committee  labored  in  near-
anonymity.  It  passed  a  variety  of  uncontroversial  ordinances, 
partly  for  the  newcomers  but  also  to  protect  the  old  residents 
against possible  "undesirables" among the  Levittowners.  For ex-
ample,  a  Police  Department  had  been  established  just  before 
they arrived, and a  year  later an  ordinance was  passed  requiring 

•  106  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

the  registration  of  residents  with  prison  records.  Shortly  there-
after,  some  county  people  considered  the  establishment  of  a 
mental  health  clinic,  reportedly  for  the  newcomers.  Few  Levit-
towners  went  to  Township  Committee  meetings,  but  then  few 
had  expressed  civic  or  political  aspirations  on  the  mail  ques-
tionnaire  before  they  arrived.  More  questionnaire  respondents 
had wanted "a voice in community affairs,"  however, and the op-
portunity to raise it soon arrived. 

Two seemingly innocuous issues,  both generated by the builder 
and  both  arousing  political  and  status  fears  among  the  new-
comers,  suddenly  placed  the  Township  Committee  in  the  fore· 
front  of public attention.  First,  Levitt acted  to eliminate a  deed 
restriction  which  forbade  nonresident  doctors  from  purchasing 
houses  solely  for  office  use.  When  he  sought  to  have  the  Town-
ship  Committee  amend  the  zoning  ordinance-as  he  generally 
tried  to  do for  all  restrictions  that could be legitimized  and  thus 
strengthened  by  municipal  action-the  already  resident  doctors 
protested. Since there was at that time still  a shortage of patients, 
they  feared  competition  from  nonresidents,  many  of  whom 
would be specialists.  They were joined by  homeowners,  many of 
them working class,  who felt  that.nonresident doctors would take 
only their money,  whereas residents  of the community would re-
spect  them. 2  But  their  major  concern  was  that  if  houses  were 
bought by nonresident  professionals,  their blocks would soon  be 
semicommercial and the community would suffer the same status 
deterioration  that  had  taken  place-for other reasons--in  Levit-
town,  Pennsylvania.3  Distrustful  of  the  builder and  the  old  resi-
dents  on  the  Township  Committee,  they  claimed  that  the  ordi-
nance  might  let  in  barbers,  beauticians,  and  other  low-status 
quasi-professionals  aswell.  "I  make  $7ooo  a  year,"  said  one.  "I 
came  here  for  a  residential  community;  don't  cheapen  this  area 
by bringing doctors in  to practice.  All we  want for  our own class 
is a residential area." 

There  was  considerable  validity  in  the  homeowners'  expecta-
tion  that  the  Committee  would  be  unresponsive,  for  rumors  to 
this  effect  had already circulated.  When they came  to  the  public 
hearing 150 persons strong, with 450 signatures on a  petition and 
20  people  to  testify  against  the  amendment,  the  Committeemen 
listened  in  silence  and  then  summarily  rejected  their  demands. 
Like  the  school  board,  the  Committee  was  opposed  to  govern-
ment  by  petition and was  so  fearful  about  its  first  confrontation 

The  Emergence  of  Party  Politics 

•  107  • 

with  the  newcomers  that  the  police  were  ordered  out  in  full 
force,  ringing  the  meeting  room  to  forestall  possible  violence. 
The  Mayor  favored  the  zoning  amendment  (to  attract  special-
ists),  and besides,  the Committee intended, as  it had  in  the  past, 
to  satisfy  the  builder's  wishes  whenever  it  could,  feeling  that as 
he  was  the  largest  landowner  and  the  determiner  of  the  town-
ship's future,  blocking him would only hurt the community. The 
Committee  did  not  give  final  approval  to  the  amendment  that 
night,  for  the Mayor saw an opportunity to  embarrass the leader 
of  the  old  elite,  then  Chairman  of  the  Planning  Board  and  the 
Mayor's  bitter political  enemy,  by  passing the  buck  to his  board 
for action. 

What  150 people could not achieve at  the Township Commit-
tee meeting a smaller group was able to do at the Planning Board 
a  month  later.  The  planning consultant suggested  that  the  mat-
ter  be  postponed  until  the  zoning ordinance  could  be  rewritten 
entirely to conform with a  preliminary master plan  that had just 
been  approved.  The  board  moved  to  accept  his  suggestion,  but 
the  opponents  suspected  a  stall  that  would  lead  to  the  eventual 
admission  of nonre~ident doctors and angrily demanded  that the 
board  take  immediate  action.  -Momentarily  intimidated,  the 
board gave  in and  voted  against nonresident  doctors.  When  the 
issue was  then returned to  the Township Committee, the nonres-
ident doctors  came  with  1200  signatures,  and a  compromise was 
passed,  allowing  only  doctors  to  purchase  houses  and  no  more 
than two  to a house.  Both political parties refused to take a stand 
on  the  controversial  issue,  not  knowing  how  the  Levittowners 
felt;  instead, they asked the Levittown Civic Association to hold a 
"nonpartisan  debate"  to  find  out.  Still  run  entirely  by  old  resi-
dents,  the  Association  too  was  fearful  of controversy,  an<;!  when 
Levittowners refused  to come out for  noncontroversial  meetings, 
it expired. 

No sooner had  the  "doctor  issue"  been  resolved  than  another 
arose--on  the sale  of liquor in  the township-and the same  pat-
tern  was  repeated.  Again,  the  Levitt  organization  provided  the 
impetus.  Willingboro  had  been  dry  since  its  inception,  but  the 
builder wanted to include a restaurant-bar and a  package store in 
his  shopping  center.  He  requested  an  ordinance  to  that  effect, 
and  once  again,  the  Township  Committee  acquiesced  after  a 
stormy  public  hearing.  The  opposition  consisted  primarily  of 
"drys"  from  the  Methodist  church  and  many  Levittowners  who 

•  lo8  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

had objected to nonresident doctors and now envisioned bars and 
liquor stores on every comer. Again  they feared a  status decline, 
using  Levittown,  Pennsylvania,  as  an  example,  and  again  they 
exaggerated  the  consequences  of  the  ordinance.  Angered  by  the 
last  meeting  and  by  the  wild  charges  leveled  at  them  from  an 
audience of "cranks and Democrats," the Committeemen made it 
clear that they had not paid attention  to  the protesting witnesses, 
for  after  the  public  hearing was  ended  they  voted  unanimously 
for the ordinance without even a preliminary caucus. 

Again,  both  political  parties stayed out of the issue  because  of 
its  controversial  nature,  but  they could  not avoid  internal  splits 
over it.  Most Democrats were wet, and the leaders expected cam-
paign contributions from  liquor dealers.  Many of the opponents 
to  both  nonresident doctors and liquor dealers were  also  Demo-
crats,  however.  Led by an old resident who was  angry over being 
denied  the  Township Committee candidacy  after  many years  as 
the lone township Democrat, they set up a separate faction  in  the 
Democratic camp. Th_e  Republican factions  had been divided on 
this issue  previously, and two leaders who opposed the Mayor or-
ganized  a  referendum  to  overturn  the  Township  Committee's 
decision.  Funded  by  liquor  dealers  outside  the  township  who 
wanted  no  competition,  and  drawing  workers  from  the  Metho-
dist church,  they campaigned for  a  dry town,  and at the  Novem-
ber  election,  won  by  a  6  to  4  margin. 4  That  election  also  pro-
duced a resounding Democratic victory,  with a  go  per cent  turn-
out giving the party 6o per cent of the vote. 

The outcome was less a victory for  the Democratic party than a 
protest against  the  Mayor's  and  the Township Committee's lack 
of  responsiveness  to  the  new  community  and  the  Republican 
party's  domination  by  the  old residents.  It was  also,  of course,  a 
vote against  any governmental  action  to reduce the community's 
status.  However, not all  Levittowners felt threatened, for another 
referendum,  initiated  by  both  parties  at  the  request  of  the 
builder,  changed  the  legal  name  of  the  township  from  Willing-
boro to Levittown. Many middle class residents preferred the old 
name  because  of  Levittown's  national  image  as  a  low-prestige 
community,  but  enough  of  them  joined  working  class  Levit-
towners  who  felt  Levitt deserved  recognition  for  having  built a 
town  in  which  they  could  afford  to  live,  and  the  name  change 
passed by a small margin. 

The  Emergence  of  Party  Politics

THE REORGANIZATION OF TOWNSIDP  GOVERNMENT 

Once  the  voters  had  expressed  their  disapproval  of  the  old  re-
gime,  and  had  placed  one  Levittowner  in  its  midst,  they  lost 
immediate  interest  in  the  affairs  of  government.  Over  the  next 
two  years  the  Township  Committee  saw  to  its  own  internal 
problems  by  setting  up  a  civil  service  structure;  passed  ordi-
nances  to  protect  the  residents  from  traffic  dangers,  garbage 
dumps, and the like;  and approved Levitt's plans for  future  sub-
divisions-matters  which  people  took  for  granted  or  which  af-
fected only a  small  number or only future  purchasers.  Of the  65 
ordinances  passed  between  October  1958  and  May  1960,  just  9 
per cent were  in direct response  to citizens'  requests,  principally 
to  approve church  and  associational  activities  regulated  by  mu-
nicipal  ordinances  and  to  change  the  building  code  to  permit 
the  construction  of  patios.6  Few  were  controversial,  and  ordi-
nances which could not be passed unanimously were either tabled 
or rewritten until unanimity was  achieved. 

The only significant  innovation was  the  reorganization  of  the 
Township  Committee.  From  the  time  Levittown  was  occupied, 
incumbent  Committeemen  and  leading  politicians realized  that 
the Committee had to be expanded, for otherwise there would be 
too much work for  individual members and it would  be difficult 
to  get  candidates  for  the  office.  There  was,  however,  no  agree-
ment over one detail:  who would direct day-to-day governmental 
activities.  Both  parties  favored  a  strong-mayor  form  of  govern-
ment,  for  the new  town  required  leadership,  the  parties needed 
symbolic  and  real  leaders,  and  a  strong  mayor  could  generate 
patronage.  It had already  become clear  that  neither  party could 
attract enough volunteer manpower for election campaigns;  both 
looked  forward  to  a  mayor  who  could  provide  them  with  loyal 
workers.  But  the  politicians  could  not  come  out  for  a  strong 
mayor.  Even  before the first  election, old residents had  talked of 
a city manager, mostly to forestall a Democratic takeover. 6  When 
the Democrats promised, as  part of their 1959 election campaign, 
to set up a Study Group to consider reorganization of the govern-
ment, many people already favored a city manager, for what with 
rising  taxes,  his  professional  skill  would  lead  to  efficient  and  in-
expensive  government.  As  one  man, who  himself  had  ambitions 

•  110  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

for  becoming mayor, admitted,  "A city manager is  a  good  thing; 
we  need  a  college  man,  a  specialist  in  there  to  do  the  job.  We 
have to get someone from outside." 

Even so,  the Township Committee was  to pick the members of 
the Study Group and could, presumably, have packed it with ad-
vocates  of a  strong mayor.  In  the  spring of  tg6o,  however,  both 
parties were so disorganized that none of the six chosen had close 
party  ties.  Also,  the  title  "Study  Group"  made  it  almost  man-
datory  to  name  well-educated  men,  and  neither  party  could 
afford to appoint professional politicians. The Republicans chose 
two  businessmen,  as  well  as  a  banker  and  an  accountant;  the 
Democrats,  a  lawyer  who  had  just  become  a  judge  and  a  social 
worker;  and  four  of  the  six  had  already  decided  privately  to 
recommend  a  city  manager,  each  on  his  own,  before  the  Study 
Group ever met.  Nevertheless,  a  conscientious  survey  of all  pos-
sible  alternatives  preceded  the  unanimous  vote  for  city-manager 
government.  The  Group  also  recommended  a  five-man  Town-
ship Council to be elected on a  partisan basis.  Most Study Group 
members would as  soon  have recommended a  nonpartisan Coun-
cil, but as  businessmen and professionals they found it difficult to 
think through the issue  and acquiesced  in  the social worker's op· 
position  to nonpartisan  elections.  In effect,  then,  one man deter-
mined the continued existence  of national  parties  in  Levittown. 
At  this  point,  neither  the  Study  Group  nor  the  politicians 
knew  whether  the  voters  would  approve  the  city  manager,  and 
expecting opposition,  the Study Group decided  that  it would be 
necessary to "sell" its recommendation to the voters. A  hired con-
sultant  wrote  a  strongly  worded  document  which  argued  that  a 
city  manager  was  essential  because,  by  his  calculations,  the 
annual  tax  bill  might well  rise  to  $645  a  house.  Although work-
ing  class  Levittowners  were  doubtful  about  a  city  manager--as 
they were about all experts and outsiders-they and everyone else 
at  once  turned  their  attention  to  the  tax  estimate.  Corning just 
after new and higher tax bills had been mailed out, this estimate 
created a  furor  and later,  in February  tg6t,  provided  a  rallying 
point for opponents to the school  budget.  If any popular contro-
versy  existed  about  the  desirability  of  a  city  manager,  it  now 
faded into the background. Just before the election, the dissident 
Democrats  tried  unsuccessfully  to  organize  against  the  Study 
Group's  recommendation.  The  Republicans  pointed  out  that 
they  had  been  for  a  city  manager  before  the  Study  Group ever

met,  the  Democrats  said  unenthusiasticaiiy  that  governmental 
reorganization was  the will  of the people, and it carried by more 
than  4  to  1  in  the  November  1960  election.  The  Study  Group 
had  no  advance  idea  of  what  people  wanted,  but  a  fortuitous 
combination of circumstances, aided by the inability of the polit-
ical  parties  either  to  carry  out or  to  oppose  the  wishes  of  their 
constituents,  had  brought  about  the  type  of  government  most 
Levittowners  undoubtedly  favored,  and  a  year  later  the  new 
Township Council  and  the  City  Manager  took  office. 

THE UPS  AND DOWNS OF PARTY POLITICS 

Even  though  the three Township Committeemen were  not  talk-
ing  to  each  other  in  the  spring  of  1960,  they  had  to  suppress 
their personal and political hostilities in order to run the govern-
ment.  The political parties had  no routine and  continuing func-
tion,  however;  their  job  was  to  find  the  constituencies,  candi-
dates,  workers,  and  issues  that  would  produce  election  victories 
and a  viable  party  organization.  This  they  failed  to  do,  for  the 
1959  Democratic victory was foliowed  by a  Republican landslide 
in  1960, a Democratic landslide in  1961,  a  Republican victory  in 
1963,  and a  standoff  in  1965;  and  after  each  election,  the  party 
organization was sure  to suffer,  particularly among  the  Republi-
cans.7 

The constant political flux was caused partly by the parties' re-
lationship  to  the  county  organization-traditionally  the  deter-
mining  one  in  New  Jersey  politics-and  the  resulting  involve-
ment in county issues and factions which had nothing to do with 
Levittown but from which the local groups could not disentangle 
themselves.  Nonpartisan  elections  would  have  helped,  although 
they  would  also  have  deprived  local  candidates  of  county  and 
state  assistance.  They would  not,  however,  have  eliminated  the 
flux,  for  many  Levittowners  considered  themselves  independ-
ents  who  decided  each  November  for  whom  they  would  vote, 
depending on the choice of candidates and the then salient issues. 
Local  politics  thus  became  a  never  ending  attempt  to  develop 
stable  constituencies  and  organizations  among  a  population 
which  regularly  changed  its  political  allegiances  in  response  to 
the conditions of the moment. 

The Democrats were more successful  than  the Republicans in 
building a stable party organization. Being almost entirely Levit-

towners, they were able to.avoid conflict with the old residents, at 
least  at  the  local  level,  and  being Democrats  they  had  an  easier 
time  finding  party  workers.  Such  people  seem  to  be  recruited 
principally  from  working  class  or  ethnic  backgrounds,  groups 
which gravitate more often to the Democrats than  to the Repub-
licans. The Levittown Democrats had attracted a number of men 
who  had  either  been  active  in  politics  previously  or  were  inter-
ested in becoming active;  many of them were of Irish and Italian 
working class  or Jewish  middle  class  origins,  who  had  no  other 
organizational  interests  and  were  ready  to  devote  time  and 
.energy  to  the  party.  A  permanent  cadre  encouraged  permanent 
leadership, enabling one of the four  party founders  to wrest con-
trol  from  his companions after the  1959  victory.  An  experienced 
politician,  he  weathered  attempts  to depose  him  after  each  elec-
tion defeat, and he remains the party leader to this day. 

The Republicans attracted some  of  the same  sort  of  people:  a 
handful  of  Protestant working class  Levittowners and some  Irish 
Catholic  middle  class  ones  who  moved  out  of  the  Democratic 
party as  they  left  the  city.  But many of  the  Republican  workers 
were  temporary  "volunteers."  These  were  lower  middle  and 
upper  middle  class  managers  and  salesmen,  who  were  active  in 
service clubs and other voluntary associations  but had little taste 
for  party  politics,  coming  in  only  to  help a  particular candidate 
and  then  returning  to  their  nonpolitical  groups.  The  resulting 
conflict  between  the  volunteers  and  the  regular  workers  pre-
vented  the  development  of  permanent  party  leadership,  and  it 
changed hands after almost every election, win or lose. 

Stable  party  leadership  alone  could  neither  produce  election 
victories  nor  prevent  factionalism,  however.  Without  loyal  con-
stituencies and a set of issues on which to build a persuasive party 
image,  the  parties  were  forced  in  each  election  to  fight  internal 
battles as well as  their opponents, and most of these struggles rep-
resented  attempts  by  various  class  blocs  to  obtain  power  and  to 
shape  the  party,  the  government,  and  the  community  in  their 
own image. 

In the spring of  1960,  both parties were split.  The Democratic 
party  leader,  who  stood  for  a  wet  community  and  cooperation 
with Levitt, was opposed by the group who had attacked the non-
resident  doctor and  liquor  ordinances  and  who  wanted  to  fight 
the  government  and  the  builder  in  order  to  make  certain  that 
Levittown  would assure  them  the  lower  middle class  status  they 

The  Emergence  of  Parly  Politics 

•  113  • 

thought they had purchased with their houses.  The Republicans, 
still largely old residents, were split by county factional  fights and 
lacked both a  leader and a  candidate for  the  November election. 
At  the  last  minute,  the  regular  Republican  party  workers,  then 
in control  of the organization, found a  candidate,  but the oppos-
ing  faction  thought  he  could  not  win  and  persuaded  a  Junior 
Chamber  of  Commerce  leader  to  run  against  him.  In  the  pri-
mary,  both organization candidates won.  Shortly  thereafter,  they 
both  resigned;  the  Republican,  for  business  reasons;  the  Demo-
crat,  a  tough  young  Italian  businessman,  because  he  threatened 
the  party  leader's  control,  was  unpopular with  the  workers,  and 
had  allegedly  misrepresented  his  educational  background.  If it 
came out in the open, the Republicans could expose him and his 
party to charges of dishonesty. 

Until  then,  neither  party had  an  issue  to catch  the  interest of 
the electorate. Although the community was concerned about the 
first  increase  in  taxes,  municipal  expenditures were of minor im-
portance,  and  the  parties  realized;  as  did  the  Levittowners,  that 
the  tax  rate  depended  on  the  actions  of  the  school  board.  The 
new  Democratic  candidate  gave  the  Republicans  the  issue  they 
needed.  The  Democrats  knew  after  the  1959  victory  that  they 
would  have  to  offer  middle  class  candidates,  but  these  were  in 
short  supply  and,  at  the  last  minute,  they  picked  one  who  was 
also  a  veteran  county  politician.  The  Republicans  named  the 
J .C. C.  leader,  who  lacked  political  experience  of any  kind.  Bor-
rowing the issue of "bossism," which  had been raised  against  the 
Democratic  party  leader  by  his  party's  dissidents,  the  Republi-
cans  campaigned  on  the  theme  that  their  candidate  would  be 
above politics and would prevent the emergence of an urban po-
litical  machine  in  Levittown. 8  This  plank,  the  personal  attrac-
tiveness  of the candidate and his running mate  (an officer  in  the 
Holy  Name Society),  attracted a  number of volunteers-most of 
them associational colleagues of  the candidates-who took charge 
of the campaign.  The campaign manager, also  a  young Catholic, 
rented  a  bookmobile,  renamed  it  a  "bandwagon,"  and  rode  it 
through the streets of Levittown offering coffee, doughnuts, and a 
chance to meet the candidates in an  informal,  almost  neighborly 
encounter.  The Democrats could not fight  the  image of bossism, 
and although John F.  Kennedy visited  Levittown just before the 
election, his gesture did not impress the voters. The Republicans 
took  all  election  districts  and  55  per cent of  the  total  vote.  The 

•  114  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

independents,  who  were  decisive,  had  rejected  alleged  machine 
politics for what many called "a young Eisenhower." 

In  1961,  the  situation  was  reversed.  Government  reorganiza-
tion  had  been  approved  at  the  1960  election,  and  with  the  City 
Manager  there  to  do  most  of  the  administrative  work  and  the 
old  residents  safely  out  of  the  picture,  neither  party  lacked 
candidates  for  the  new  five-man  Township  Council.  This  time, 
the  Democratic  leader sensed what  the  electorate wanted.  Taxes 
had  become  the  issue,  and  he  selected  a  slate described  as  quali-
fied  to  work  with  the  City  Manager  in  the  overriding  task  of 
keeping  taxes  low,  including an accountant, a  cost  engineer, and 
two other white collar workers.  He also  made sure that  the slate 
included a  Protestant,  a  Jew,  and a  man  from  the most  recently 
settled neighborhoods. The Republicans fared less well. Once the 
1960  election  was  won,  the  volunteers  had  departed,  and  the 
small band of working class party workers took over.  They forced 
out the  victorious campaign  manager and put up a  slate consist-
ing  largely  of  their  own  people.  Feeling  that  this  slate  lacked 
both the skill  and the status to win,  the ex-campaign manager or-
ganized  an  opposing  ticket  of  "quality"  candidates,  several  of 
them Catholics and almost all with high-level white collar or pro-
fessional  jobs.  If the  independents among  the  Levittowners  had 
voted  in  the  primaries,  the  "quality slate"  might  have  won,  but 
they  did  not,  and  the  organization  candidates  of  both  parties 
were victorious. 9  The Democrats  hammered on  the need  for  tax 
reduction and the qualifications of their candidates for achieving 
it,  keeping  the  party leader behind the scenes  to forestall  further 
charges of "bossism." They easily beat the  Republican ticket in a 
lackluster election. 

With no election  scheduled  for  the  next  two years  the  Demo-
crats  consolidated  their  hold  over  township  government  with 
municipal  appointees,  and  also  strengthened  their  image  as  the 
party of low  taxes  by forcing a  cut in  the school  budget after the 
February  1963  school  election. 10  It seemed as  if Levittown might 
become  permanently  Democratic,  but  now  it  was  that  party's 
turn  to misjudge the electorate.  Shortly before  the  1963  election 
the  Township  Council  approved  a  zoning  amendment  permit-
ting Levitt to  build garden apartments in  the community.  Many 
Levittowners felt that these would bring in more transient, lower-
status  families  with  many  children,  which  would  require  yet 
higher school  taxes.  They also objected to the Council's policy of 

The  Emergence  of  Party  Politics 

•  115  Ill 

helping the builder out of sales  difficulties.  Most  important, they 
resented the Council's failure to listen to their protest against the 
amendment  :tt  a  public  hearing.  Once  again  Levittown  politi-
cians were  punished by the voters  for  the  same  unresponsiveness 
to status fears  that had defeated the old residents in 1959, and the 
Republicans  were swept  into office,  taking control  of the  Town-
ship Council. 

Prior  to  this victory,  the  Republican  party had  been virtually 
moribund.  The  old  workers  had  left  and,  for  a  time,  were  re-
placed  by  the  Birchites  who  had  attacked  the  school  board  for 
Communist sympathies.  In  1962,  they led an energetic campaign 
against  fluoridation  of  the  town's  water  supply,  but  when  the 
voters  rejected  their  appeals  by a  considerable  margin  they  dis. 
appeared,  and  a  new  group  of  more  liberal  Republicans  carne 
into the party. 

The 1963  election ballot also included a referendum to change 
the  township's  name  back  to  Willingboro.  Initiated  by  C.A.P.S. 
leaders who  had also  led the fight  against garden apartments,  the 
referendum  was  supported  by  middle  class  people  who  felt  the 
old name was  more  prestigious and  would  repair  the damage  to 
the  community's  reputation  generated  by  the  tax  disputes.  The 
vote  was  close,  but  the  name change carried  by  100  votes  out of 
6ooo.  The  referendum  was  significant  also  in  that  both  parties 
took  stands  on  a  controversial  issue,  the  Republicans  favoring 
the name change and the Democrats opposing it. 

It  would  appear,  then,  that  separate  constituencies  were  de-
veloping and the two parties were lining up as  they do on the na-
tional scene.  Middle class voters seeking to maintain the commu-
nity's  status  were  now  siding  with  the  Republicans,  joined  by 
some  cosmopolitans who had despaired of "reforming" the Dem-
ocrats.  Working  class  Catholics  and  less  affluent  white  collar 
workers  who,  pressed  financially,  either  could  no  longer  worry 
about status or were less concerned about what outsiders  thought 
of Levittown, were voting for Democrats.  In the  1965  election, a 
Republican candidate spoke of "the failure  to project a desirable 
image  of  the  community . . . .  Outsiders  sneer_  'Kookstown' 
when Willingboro is  mentioned." The Democrats attacked a  Re-
publican  plan  for  a  "million-dollar  municipal  complex"  when 
"hundreds of families are on the brink of economic survival," ar-
guing for belt-tightening on taxes instead. 

As  in prior years,  both parties continued to hope that industry 

•  116  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

could  be  attracted  into  the  township  to relieve  the  tax  burden, 
but  by  this  time,  neither  was  confident  that  it  would  happen. 
The  election  was  extremely  close,  the  voters  choosing  one  Re-
publican  and  one  Democrat,  with  only  25  votes  separating  the 
winning  and  losing  candidates.  The community  seemed  almost 
evenly divided  between  those  fearful  of lowered status and those 
fearful  of  higher  taxes,  but an  unexpected  event  or a  new  issue 
could change the political complexion at once,  reversing the for-
tunes  of  the  two  parties  or of  their  internal  factions  at  the  next 
election. 

THE ORIGIN OF MUNICIPAL SERVICES 

Before  the  Levittowners  came,  the  township  had  obtained  fire 
protection  and ambulance services  from  an adjacent community, 
and  its  residents  used  the  county  library.  Once  the  newcomers 
had  arrived,  the  Township  Committee  set  up  a  Police  Depart-
ment  and  a  Board  of  Health,  took  over  the  operation  of  the 
Levitt·built  water  and  sewage  treatment  plant,  and  regulated 
garbage removal  (which was  privately contracted),  but it was  too 
busy  to consider  other services.  These  were  left  to  the  initiative 
of  External  and  Internal  founders,  and  although  they  started 
like  voluntary  associations,  they  soon  requested  municipal  sub-
sidies  and  eventually  became  governmental  appendages.  Their 
founding  illustrates  the  close  relationship  between  organiza-
tional  and  political  party  politics  and  the  impact  of  class  on 
both. 

The Township Library and the Volunteer Fire Company 

After an abortive attempt by  the county librarian  to persuade 
the  builder  and  the  Township  Committee  to  start  a  library  in 
Levittown,  two  women,  needing  a  library  for  themselves  and 
their children,  proposed  its  establishment at a  Civic  Association 
meeting  in  September  1959·  Unskilled  at  the  finer  points  of 
organizing,  however,  they  soon  gave  way  to  a  lawyer  who  had 
been  forced  out  of  the  Republican  party  leadership  during  the 
hassle over liquor sales. Aided by the county librarian, he set up a 
Levittown  Library Association  later that month and,  in  Novem-
ber, persuaded the builder to donate a  three-acre site to celebrate 
the  community's  first  anniversary.  Then,  with  the  help  of 
women's clubs and  the  PT As,  the  Association  organized  a  book 

The  Emergence  of  Party  Politics 

•  117  • 

collection drive;  after Levittowners had contributed  2000  books, 
the  Township  Committee  provided  a  vacant  room  in  the  town-
ship building.  Because  most of the donated  books were old best-
sellers  and  book  club  selections,  discards  of  little  interest  to 
adults and not suitable for children,  the lawyer asked  the Town-
ship  Committee  for  municipal  funds  and,  having  engineered 
support  from  women's  clubs,  PT As,  and  service  clubs,  he  was 
able to get them. 

The two women had wanted only a  modest library, and one of 
them, who later became active in the Democratic party, was  fear-
ful  that  too  large  a  municipal  subsidy  would  result  in  a  tax 
increase or retard  the development of a  fire  company and a  hos-
pital. Although she said that "The first  thing I  look for  in a com-
munity is  my church and a  library," she qualified:  "As much as  I 
want a library, it is second to fire  protection and a hospital." Her 
attitude reflected  Democratic and  particularly working class  sen-
timent, which  held,  in the words of one Levittowner,  that "Body 
comes before mind." 

The  Republican  lawyer  and  his  colleagues  were  interested  in 
getting an  impressive library-and as  quickly  as  possible-to de-
velop a  community service  that would  bring them  political  sup-
port  and  perhaps  even  make  the  library  a  Republican  satellite. 
Most  of  their  initial  support  came  from  organizations  in  which 
Republicans were  especially  active,  and many  hoped  the  library 
could thus be a symbol of Republican strength and achievement. 
At that time,  the Veterans of Foreign Wars,  predominantly Dem-
ocratic, had organized a  volunteer fire  company and were asking 
for  public funds  to  build  the  company  and  a  firehouse.  Indeed, 
their plans were  so  far  advanced  that  they  had  just  asked  Levitt 
to give  the  site  originally  donated  for  a  library  to  the  fire  com-
pany. The founder of the library also wanted an impressive struc-
ture to provide the community with a  cultural and therefore un-
mistakably middle class  institution to compete with and counter-
act the fire company, which demonstrated working class strength. 
There was merit in establishing both a library and a fire company 
in Levittown, for using the county library and the fire  companies 
of  nearby  towns  was  inconvenient,  but questions  of  merit  were 
forgotten as  the two facilities  became symbols  in the struggle be-
tween  two classes over their ability to commandeer public funds, 
to  show  class  power,  and  to  determine  the  class  image  of  the 
community. 

•  118  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

The  Township  Committee  pared  the  initial  demand  for  li-
brary  funds  to $sooo,  sufficient  to  buy more  useful  and  respect-
able books and to hire a  part-time librarian. By  1g6o, almost  two 
thirds of the families held library cards (although  the main book 
borrowers  were  children)  and  there  was  enough  public  interest 
in the library to pass a referendum making it a municipal agency. 
There was not enough demand, however,  for a  building, and the 
library was  located first  in  the Town  Hall and later in  the main 
shopping center. 

The initial  competition between  the library and  the fire  com-
pany  had  developed  because,  after  the  Library  Association  was 
safely  established,  its  founder,  who  had  meanwhile  been  frus-
trated in his attempt to return to power in the Republican party, 
set  out to organize a  fire  company as  well.  He  first  proposed  the 
idea at a  Kiwanis  meeting,  suggesting  it become  a  club  project. 
This galvanized another  Kiwanis member,  the Democratic  party 
leader,  into action,  and before the  Kiwanis  could  meet again  to 
consider the matter he encouraged one of his precinct captains, a 
founder of the VFW,  to recruit sufficient members from  that or-
ganization  to form  the  company.  The  reasons  for  their  urgency 
and  their  success  are  not  hard  to  find.  The  Democratic  party 
leader wanted to bring the fire company into the Democratic fold 
both as community service advertising for  the party and as a  pos-
sible  future  source  of  patronage.  If the  firemen  were  predom-
inantly VFW members,  that  organization would  benefit  in  com-
munity stature and, perhaps, would also attract more veterans.  It 
was  essential,  therefore,  that  the  two  Democrats  beat  the  Re-
publican  lawyer  and  the  Kiwanis-also  predominantly  Republi-
can  in  outlook-to  the  punch.  The  service  club  unwittingly 
played  into  their  hands;  at  the  last  minute,  it  postponed  the 
meeting on the fire company for what it considered a more urgent 
issue. 

Proud of his working class origins and quite hostile toward the 
middle class elements of the community, the Democratic precinct 
captain  felt  that  the  fire  company provided  an  opportunity  for 
"working men"  to  do  their  part  for  the  community  and  to  ob-
tain  their share  of municipal  funds,  particularly since  the  town-
ship had just funded the library. He also knew how to sell  the fire 
company  to  his  VFW  members.  It would  enhance  local  pride, 
end  the  drain  of  Levittown  tax  monies  to  other  communities, 
and  reduce  fire  insurance  rates  for  the  homeowners.  Soon  it 

The  Emergence  of  Party  Politics 

•  ng  • 

would build a  firehouse  which would become a  social  center for 
working class men, particularly since the defeat of the liquor ref-
erendum had decreased  the attractiveness of the VFW clubhouse 
as a gathering place. 

The  VFW  leader  probably  knew  also  that  a  number  of  his 
members  craved  the  excitement  of  fire  fighting,  enjoyed  main-
taining  the  fire  truck,  and  above  all,  wanted  to  get  out  of  the 
house.  The  fire  company  would  give  them  a  proper  excuse. 
Finally, for  the leader himself there was,  aside from  the political 
triumph,  the chance  to upstage  the middle class  by showing that 
it depended on working class people for the protection of life and 
property.  He was  fond  of  telling  everyone  that  "schools  and  li-
braries  are  fine,  but  they  don't  put  out  the  fire  or  stop  the 
enemy."  (The  enemy was  the  Russians,  who  would  presumably 
be  stopped  by  Levittown's  civil  defense  program  which  he  had 
also just helped to organize.) 

Once  the  fire  company was  safely  organized,  the VFW  leader 
decided  that  fire  protection  was  too crucial  to  be left  to  laymen 
and looked for an expert. The Kiwanis club had contacted a resi-
dent  fire  insurance  underwriter,  but  when  their  meeting  was 
postponed,  the  VFW  approached  him,  promising  not  only  the 
top  job  but  enough  men  to  staff  a  company.  In  addition,  they 
told him  that some civil  defense money could legitimately be di-
verted  to  help  the  fire  company  get  started  and  the  Township 
Committee  was  willing  to  provide  municipal  funds  to  buy  the 
first  engine.  The Democrats'  choice was  not random;  the  under-
writer  had  been  one  of  the  first  active  Republicans  among  the 
Levittowners  and  was  then  being  wooed  by  the  Democratic 
party.  He was  also  of working class  origin  and,  whether  his  pur-
suers  knew  it  or  not,  felt  uncomfortable  in  Republican  and 
Kiwanis  circles.  After  he  took  over  the  fire  company,  he  joined 
the Democrats. 

Like  other  predominantly  working class  groups,  the  fire  com-
pany included some middle class people, in order to obtain polit-
ical  support  from  organizations  with  which  they  were  affiliated 
and to get legal and medical services.  Doctors vied for the unpaid 
position  of  medical  director,  for  it  offered  splendid  advertising 
among  a  working  class  population  they  could  not  easily  reach 
otherwise.  A  fire  company auxiliary was initiated by the wives of 
company  officers.  At  its  founding,  one  of  the  men  joked  about 
its  purpose:  "It's to  train  the  women  to  let  the  husbands out of 

•  120  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

the house  to fight  fires."  There was some  justification for  his  sar-
casm,  for  aside  from  community  service  and  a  chance  to  help 
their  husbands,  the  auxiliary  gave  the  wives  an  opportunity  to 
discourage  the  men  from  holding  stag  smokers  and  drinking 
parties. The company soon asked Levitt for a building site; a fire-
house  was  put  up  in  1961,  and  from  then  on,  many  members 
spent  a  great  deal  of  time  there,  most  of  it  polishing  the  fire 
engines.  Subsequently,  the  VFW  and  some  Democrats  helped 
start  an  Emergency  Ambulance  Squad  and  an  auxiliary,  again 
made  up  predominantly  of  working  class  residents.  But  with  a 
hospital  in  the community,  its  services  were  not  in  as  much  de-
mand, and  the squad never grew  large enough  to obtain its  own 
building, housing its ambulance in a gas station. 

Public  Recreation 

Class  conflict  also  pervaded  the  development of public recrea-
tion  in  Levittown,  but this conflict paled alongside  political and 
jurisdictional struggles between  the school  board and the Town-
ship Committee, which have so  far prevented the development of 
a  municipal  recreation  agency.  Levitt  had  located  playgrounds 
around the  elementary schools with  the  intention that  they,  like 
the  pools,  would  be  used  by  the  community after  school  hours. 
He  provided  no  money  to  develop  them,  however,  and  the 
schools,  beset  by  budget cuts,  never had  the funds,  so  they  have 
remained little more than baseball fields. 

Two months after the first  Levittowners arrived,  the newly ap-
pointed police chief appealed to the newcomers to set up a  Levit-
town  Youth  Sports  Association  (L.Y.S.A.)  to  forestall  the  juve-
nile  delinquency  he  expected  to  develop  the  next summer.  His 
appeal  turned  up  a  dozen  men,  some  previously  active  in  local 
juvenile  athletic  programs,  others  in  Little  Leagues.  Soon  they 
were  embroiled in a  bitter definitional struggle,  one  group seek-
ing strictly local  leagues in which everyone could play,  the other, 
eventual  affiliation  with  the  national  Little  League,  a  baseball 
progTam  modeled  on  the  major  leagues  which  favored  athlet-
ically  inclined  youngsters.  During the  first  year  the advocates  of 
local  programs,  most  of  them  middle  class  Protestants who  only 
wanted to enable their children  to  play softball, were in control, 
but  even  then  the  team  coaches  and  managers,  who  were  pre-
dominantly working class Catholics, favored  the heightened com-
petition of Little League ball.11  The latter also scheduled dances 

The  Emergence  of  Party  Politics 

•  121  • 

for  teenagers,  outvoting the middle class  men who did not share 
their  concern  with  keeping  the  youngsters  from  "getting  into 
trouble." 

After  the  first  year  of  baseball,  the  predominantly  working 
class  group ejected  the  middle  class  officers  and elected  as  presi-
dent  of  the  Sports  Association  a  professional  youth  worker  (a 
leader of  the  Catholic parish),  and other leading Catholics as  di-
rectors.  As  the second  year's  program was  getting underway,  the 
parish  priest  wanted  to  set  up  a  branch  of  the  Catholic  Youth 
Organization,  but  the  new  Catholic  officers  persuaded  him  to 
postpone  his  plans  in  order  to  prevent  a  mass  exodus  of adults 
and children from L.Y.S.A.  He was  eager to cooperate in order to 
avoid  religious  strife,  but  the  remaining  Protestants  were  not 
pacified and they became more dismayed as  the baseball program 
moved closer  to  the Little League model.  That winter,  their dis-
satisfaction and a small-scale rebellion by teenagers who resented 
the  Catholics'  close  supervision  over  them  at  L.Y.S.A.  dances 
sparked  the  mass  resignation  of  the  Catholic  officers;  they  were 
replaced  by a  new  group  of anti-Little  League  Protestants.  Even 
so,  an  ex-minor  league  ballplayer  now  took  over  the  baseball 
program and brought it yet closer to Little League standards,  al-
though he also made sure that less skillful youngsters would play. 
This in  turn  upset  the managers,  who,  wanting urgently to  win, 
began  to  question  the  decisions  of  the  umpires.  The officers  re-
buked the managers for poor sportsmanship and setting a bad ex-
ample for the children, and at the end of the season the managers 
forced  the  incumbents  out  of  office. 12  After  another  year  of 
skirmishing,  the  last  opponents  of  Little  League  were  gone  and 
L.Y.S.A.  affiliated itself with the national  Little  League.  In  1964, 
a  Willingboro  team  nearly won  a  world  championship. 

The youth  worker  who  had  been  elected  by  the  managers  in 
the winter of  1959  had  proposed  that  L.Y.S.A.  be  taken  over  by 
the municipality to solve its financial  problems and to become the 
spearhead  of  a  municipal  recreation  program  (which,  the  story 
went,  he  hoped  to  run).  Instead,  the  Township Committee  pro-
vided  L.Y.S.A.  with  a  small  subsidy  and  set  up  a  Recreation 
Study  Group  to  look  into  the  community's  overall  recreation 
needs.  After  his  election  to  the  school  board  as  part  of  the  so-
called  "Catholic  slate,"  he  urged  the  board  to  provide  more 
money for recreation, and when  this failed,  to  transfer all  recrea-
tion  functions  to  the  Township  Committee.  Some  board  mem-

hers  agreed,  for  with  the  oppos1uon  to  higher  school  budgets, 
recreation  would  always  receive  a  low  priority,  but  the  play-
grounds did belong to  the school system and  the first  superinten-
dent, an athletic enthusiast, would not surrender them. 

The Study  Group  met  for  almost  a  year,  but could  not  agree 
on  a  plan,  for  some  members  wanted  to  support  L.Y.S.A.,  some 
wanted  a  parks  program,  and  yet  others  viewed  recreation  only 
as a  means of delinquency prevention. Also  hampered by the  un-
willingness  of  the  school  board  to  let  anyone  plan  for  its  play-
grounds  and  by  the  builder's  reluctance  to  provide  alternative 
recreational  sites,  the  Study  Group disbanded  without  a  report. 
As  long as  the  Township  Committee  and  the  successor  Council 
were under Democratic control, however,  these bodies continued 
to  talk about municipal recreation,  and  in  1961,  paid for  bleach-
ers  in  the  high  school  stadium  and  for  uniforms  for  the  high 
school  band when  the school  board had to cut its  budget.  Aware 
of the  interest in recreation of working class  and  Catholic  Levit-
towners,  Democratic  politicans  also  became  boosters  of  the  var-
sity  teams  and  campaigned  for  municipal  support of  teenage  fa-
cilities.  For  a  variety  of  reasons,  however-to  be  described  in 
Chapter  Nine-no  such  program  has  yet  been  established,  al-
though  parks  are  planned  under  a  state  and  federally  funded 
"Green Acres" program.

wanted to establish a following  that would force  the party to  take

filed  anyway  to  see  if they  could  attract  the  independent  vote. 
Their  platform,  a  municipal  equivalent  of  C.A.P.S.,  sought  to 
substitute planning for  partisan  politics  and patronage,  but their

vote.

tax reduction and allowing the  accountant to become  Mayor.

the map."

ball and  wanted badly  to  win,  but their desire  was  shared by  the 
children.  Although  they  could  have  been  restrained,  there  is  no 
evidence  that  the  children  were  hurt by the  competition,  except, 
of  course,  the  poorer  players  who  were  shunted  aside.  The  case 
against  the  Little  League  is  stated  in  Recreation  (1952);  a  study 
showing no harmful effects is reported in Recreation (1951), i-· 490·

THE  ORIGIN  OF 

A  COMMUNITY 

D

D 

IN  OCTOBER  1961,  LEVITI'OWN  WAS  THREE  YEARS  OLD.  AS  OF  THAT 
July  4200  homes  had  been  built  and  occupied;  the  shopping 
center was  half  completed;  most  of  the  churches  were  either  in 
their buildings or about to move in;  new schools were still  going 
up and a  six-grade  parochial  school  was  in  operation.  Nearly  a 
hundred  organizations  were  functioning;  government  reorgani-
zation was about to take effect and a city manager was being hired. 
Levittown  had  become  a  community.  It  resembled  the  other 
Levittowns in its daily routine, its array of voluntary associations, 
and its politics, and it was probably typical  as  well.of many other 
settlements of young  middle-income families  who  had  chosen  to 
live outside  the city limits. 1 

In  becoming a  community,  Levittown  had  also  gone  through 
what seemed a  typical  origin  process.2  The residents  had  at  first 
associated almost  exclusively with  their neighbors,  but some  had 
then  sought  more  compatible  people  and .activities  outside  the 
block and had thereby set in motion the founding of community-
wide  groups.  These groups  were  started  by  founders  who  either 
came  to  Levittown  with  the  intent  of  setting  them  up  or were 
stimulated by outsiders,  or they began spontaneously  in reaction 
to momentary community and individual  needs.  Yet  even  when 
founders were individuals, they usually did not start groups with-
out  some  assurance  that  others  were  interested,  either  because 
they might be "in the same boat"-for example,  a  lonely  house-

•  125  • 

wife-or  because  they  suspected  people  of  similar  interests  and 
backgrounds  were  available.  Until  such  people  were  found  the 
organization could not really begin  to  function.  Once  it had  be-
gun  to  function,  the  need  to  survive  in  the  midst  of competing 
organizations  with  the  same  need  required  numerical  strength 
(so  that  pre-existing membership  requirements  were  abrogated) 
and  haste  (so  that  officers  were  elected  quickly  and  activities 
gotten underway). 

Relaxation  of membership requirements and speed of organi-
zation were sure to generate definitional struggles over the future 
of  the  organization.  The  manifest  struggles  were  usually  about 
the  content  of  the  organizational  program  and  the  speed  of 
growth. Those advocating a specific program usually favored slow 
growth;  those  less  dedicated  to  a  program  and  more  concerned 
with  organizational  survival  (and  victory  in  the  interorganiza-
tion  competition)  demanded  rapid  growth.  The  advocates  of 
rapid growth generally won out in the voluntary associations and 
the churches, whereas  in the public agencies-particularly in the 
school system and the government-the victory went to  the advo~ 
cates of slow growth. In this instance, their victory did not signify 
public support of governmental programs,  however,  but reflected 
the  demand  of  the  "members"  for  minimal  expenditures  (and 
taxes).  That  victory  also  signified  the  absence  of  competing 
groups  in  the  public  sphere,  which  eliminated  the  most  urgent 
organizational incentive for speed. 

At a more latent level, organizational struggles were reflections 
of class  differences,  intertwined with religious ones and the ever 
present  split  between  the  locals  and  the  cosmopolitans.  In  the 
voluntary  associations,  the  proponents  of  rapid  growth  were 
usually lower middle class people who sought to put their organi-
zations  on  the  map  in  the  community;  the  advocates  of  slow 
growth  were  often  upper  middle  class  cosmopolitans,  less  con-
cerned with organizational status than with substantive program-
matic goals.  In  the  public agencies,  the  positions  were  reversed; 
the  cosmopolitans  wanted  rapid  growth  so  that  these  agencies 
would  get  to  the  programs  they  demanded.  The  majority  of 
locals favored slow growth, except for athletic and other activities 
which  would  aid  Levittown  in  the  county's  intercommunity 
competition. 

The  cross-cutting  of  class  and  cosmopolitan-local  considera-
tions is  illustrated by the behavior of two township officials,  both 

•  126  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

also  active  in  the  Jewish  community,  who  took  diametrically 
different  positions  in  their  synagogue  and  municipal  roles.  One 
was  an  upper  middle  class  professional  and,  as  president  of  the 
school  board,  he  urged  rapid  expansion  of  the  curriculum  and 
guidance programs to benefit bright children;  whereas the other, 
a  lower  middle  class  manager  and  then  Mayor  of  Levittown, 
feared further tax increases and UJ"ged  minimal expansion. In the 
Conservative  synagogue,  their  positions  were  reversed.  The  pro-
fessional  wanted  a  coqgregation  dedicated  to  Jewish  education; 
the  manager  wanted  a  rapidly  growing  congregation  with  a 
building and a  full-time rabbi. The professional, a cosmopolitan, 
saw  both institutions  in terms of  program;  the manager,  a  local, 
was  most  concerned  with  assuring  their  survival.  The  govern-
ment and  the  school  would  survive  regardless  of  financial  prob-
lems,  but the  synagogue  might not,  and so  the  manager  favored 
low  taxes  in the  former,  but deficit  financing  for  the  latter.  The 
two men also split on who should make the decisions;  the cosmo-
politan  argued  that  a  qualified  professional  should  guide  both 
school  and synagogue;  the local  believed that these  should be re-
sponsive  to  their  constituents,  a  majority  of  whom  favored  his 
own  priorities. 

The definitional  struggles,  when added  to  interorganizational 
competition, produced considerable insecurity, which in turn led 
to  the  speedy  rejection  of  dissidents.  The  first  to  be  extruded 
were  individuals whose  backgrounds differed  sharply  from  those 
of  the  majority,  "loners"  who  did  not  get  along with  their  col-
leagues, and "idealists," people with unusual but acceptable ideas 
that were  too  expensive.  The bitterest  hostility was  reserved  for 
"radicals,"  people with  unusual  and  unacceptable  ideas  who  re-
fused  to compromise.3  The term did not refer to political views, 
and  in  the commonsense  usage  of  the  word,  Levittown  had  few 
radicals (none of the left and only a  handful of the right).  It was, 
rather,  a  relative  term,  applied  to  powerless  dissidents.  One 
Levittowner,  who  was  forced  to  leave  several  organizations dur-
ing  his  first  year  because  of  his  unwillingness  to  compromise, 
soon  acquired a  reputation as  a  man "with axes  to  grind"  and a 
"radical." When he ran  for  the school  board as  a  member of the 
Catholic slate, however, he had support for his point of view, and 
though  as  irascible  and  uncompromising as  ever,  was  no longer 
described  as  a  radical.  Once  anger  over  the  school  budget  had 
died down,  his brief popularity ended, and when he had difficul-

The  Origin  of  a  Community 

•  127  • 

ties in working with his fellow  board members, he resigned. Soon 
afterward he left Levittown. 

In  many  organizations,  people  of  higher  or  lower  status  than 
the majority of members were also extruded eventually, although 
more  gradually  and  less  acrimoniously  than  radicals.  For  ex· 
ample, an  upper middle class  program chairman in a  lower mid-
dle class  group  learned  quickly  that  her  "educational"  aims  for 
the organization were not welcome.  As  she described it, "There's 
been criticism that the programming is  too high, that there aren't 
enough laughs.  I  think the girls want a  lecture from a  beautician 
or a  program about hats,  but this is a waste of time for me.  .  .  . I 
have  invited  the  Anti-Defamation  League  for  next  month's  pro-
gram.  That  should  generate  some  criticism,  but  I  don't  care." 
Actually, she was  never criticized openly,  but the group picked a 
culturally more congruent program chairman the following year. 
The  most  systematic  extrusion,  though  not  planned,  was  of  the 
cosmopolitans, who soon  found  themselves in a  minority in most 
of  the  organizations  they  entered  and  in  constant  conflict  with 
the  local  orientation  of  their  leaders.  Eventually,  they  resigned 
from  the  groups  in  which  they  had  been  active,  limiting  them-
selves  to  organizations  with  cosmopolitan  aims  or surfacing spo-
radically to head protest movements against particular school and 
township policies! 

As  organizations  matured,  conflicts  over  the  speed  of  growth 
became  irrelevant,  and  after  losers  in  the  definitional  struggle 
had left or had given up the fight,  the groups achieved a  measure 
of  stability.  Major  organizational  crises  "were  replaced  by  the 
everyday  mixture  of  cooperation  and  petty  conflict  that  marks 
any organization;  membership size  became constant;  attendance, 
habitual;  and  programs,  routine.  There  was  still  a  constant 
search for  "ideas" that would attract new members or bring back 
laggard  ones,  and  occasionally  new  activities  were  started  or  or-
ganizational  revivals  held  for  this  purpose.  The continuing de-
velopment  of  new  neighborhoods  always  provided  additional 
members  and  an  occasional  new  leader,  although,  as  I  noted 
earlier,  the  later  arrivals  tended  to  prefer  their  own  organiza-
tions.  Even  so,  most  of  the  organizations  now  functioning  in 
Levittown were founded during the first  two or three years;  later, 
new  ones  came  slowly.  External  founders  were  no  longer  inter-
ested,  and  besides,  almost  all  the  national  groups  that  might 
appeal  to  people  like  the  Levittowners  were already  present.  In 

•  128  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

addition, I  suspect, the later arrivals had less need for new organ· 
izations,  for  the sorting function  could be  taken care of by exist· 
ing ones and moving into an established community is  not quite 
the  same  as  moving  into a  brand  new  one.  The pioneering  im-
pulse to  participate in a  new group simply because such a  group 
was needed to make Levittown into a community had died out-
it was  never very  strong  even  among  the  first  arrivals--and  the 
later  purchasers  probably  even  more  than  the  first  came  for  the 
house rather  than for  the community. 5  They were  no longer "in 
the same  boat,"  for  the original  boat  that had arrived  in the un-
known  and  possibly  hostile  seas  of  Burlington  County  had  be-
come firmly anchored. 

The  process  of  community  origin  I  have  described  fits  most 
closely  that  of  the  voluntary  associations  and  the  churches. 
Properly speaking, neither the school  system nor the government 
was  founded  anew  in  Levittown;  they  were  taken  over  from  the 
old residents and altered.  Of course,  the school system-as distin-
guished  from  the  school  board-was  new,  and  it  went  through 
the  same definitional  struggles  as  a  voluntary  organization.  The 
superintendent-founder  had  to  bend  his  ideas  to  residents  who 
had  different  conceptions  of  the  school,  but  ultimately  was  re-
placed-like many an  organizational  founder-because  he could 
not get along with his "members" and was  unable to achieve  the 
gTowth  speed  those  in  power wanted  from  him.  Also,  the  school 
and  the  municipal  government were,  like voluntary associations, 
involved  in  a  daily  routine  from  which  they  could  not  diverge 
significantly, so  that they too described a  path from origin (or re· 
birth) through definitional struggle to uneasy stability. 

Their political arms could not follow such a path, however;  in-
deed, it is difficult to talk of an origin process in politics at all, for 
political  institutions  must  always  respond  to  changing  commu· 
nity conditions, sometimes almost at a moment's notice, and have 
little opportunity to build stable organizations. School politicians 
could  protect  themselves  somewhat  against  constant  ups  and 
downs,  for  the school  was  endowed with  enough civic sacredness 
to be "above politics." The political  parties could not so  protect 
them~elves, however,  and  had  to  bear  the  brunt  of  the  commu-
nity-formation  conflicts.  Unlike  voluntary  associations  or  even 
the  schools,  which  extracted  some  loyalty  from  the  parents,  the 
political  parties had no loyal  members to speak of,  for  the party 
workers gave  their allegiance  more to victorious candidates  than 

The  Origin  of  a  Community 

•  129  • 

to  the  party and  too  few  voters  considered  themselves  partisans. 
They  shifted  their  votes  to  whatever  party-or  more  often,  to 
whatever candidate-promised to meet  their current needs.  The 
parties could not easily adapt to this flux,  however, for being con-
nected to county, state,  and national  bodies,  they also  had to  pay 
attention  to  outside  requirements.  In  most  suburbs,  the  Demo-
crats  represent  working  class  and  ethnic  populations;  the  Re-
publicans,  the  middle  class  and  Protestant  ones.  In  Levittown, 
however, both had to appeal to the lower middle class  in order to 
have  a  chance  of  victory,  and  this  group  included  not  only  the 
independents  but also  a  large  number of mobile  Catholics,  once 
Democrats,  who  were  now  quite  undecided  as  to  which  party 
would best meet  their needs.  As  a  result,  both parties  had  to  de-
velop flexible  local  programs and images without totally surrend-
ering  their county and  national  programs,  and  this  ambivalence 
added to the constant factional  battles. 

Th~ parties' problems were compounded by the Levittowners' 
distrust  of  politics  and  politicians.  Among  ex-city  dwellers,  the 
distrust  had  been  learned  in  childhood,  but  became  stronger 
when  they were able,  for  the first  time,  to see  politicians and the 
political  process  up close.  Levittowners  from  other  suburbs  had 
perhaps become accustomed  to  this view,  but their suspicion was 
also  heightened  at first  by  the  failure  of  the  old  residents  to  re-
spond to their new constituents. As  a result,  when Levittown was 
less  than  a  year  old  many  people  believed  that  the  community 
was  run by a  corrupt political  clique which  would be difficult  to 
remove. Later events disproved this assessment,  of course,  but the 
distrust  was  transferred  to Levittowners who  became  politicians, 
particularly  because  of  the  ambivalence  the  voters  imposed  on 
them. The politicians were  also  confronted  with  insoluble  prob-
lems  for  which,  like  American  politicians  everywhere,  they  had 
to  promise solutions during election  campaigns.  Without  an  in-
dustrial tax base,  Levittown was  condemned to  ever  rising taxes, 
and  many  voters  were  sophisticated  enough  to  know  that  the 
candidates' best intentions,  their earnest campaign promises, and 
even  their  energetic  efforts  once  in  office  could  not  really  snip 
more  than  a  few  dollars  off  either school  or  municipal  budgets. 
This increased  the voters'  distrust and  heightened  their demand 
for  someone  above  politics,  a  city  manager  or  a  politician  who 
sought  to  be  nonpartisan.  Nonpartisanship  was  not  enough, 
however,  for  the  voters  rejected  the  upper  middle  class  Inde-

•  130  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

pendent  slate  which  ran  on  an  antipolitical  platform  in  1gth. 
They  wanted  nonpartisans  of  their  own  class,  who  reflected 
their desire to limit the expansion bf municipal services. 

In  the  end,  they  resigned  themselves  to  the  continued  exis-
tence  of  party  politics;  and,  being  neither  cosmopolitan  nor 
upper  middle  class,  they  were  even  willing  to  live  with  a  party 
boss  (at least  in  the Democratic  party)  provided  he  continued  to 
press  for  lower  taxes  and  remained  in  the  background,  perhaps 
only to serve as a convenient scapegoat if and when another polit-
ical  crisis  arose. 8  Of course,  they  could  always  point  to  the  city 
manager  and  the  school  superintendent  as  professionals  who 
would  provide  nonpolitical  services,  but  in  the  last  analysis  the 
Levittowners settled for  party politics because what they  wanted 
from the political process was ultimately more important to them 
than who would oversee  it. 

Individual associations, churches, and even political parties did 
not  function  in  isolation,  and  though  they  competed  against 
each  other  for  members,  they  were  also  thrown  together  for 
common  tasks.  These  tasks  and  the  shortage  of leaders  had  pro-
duced  the  interlocking  directorates,  temporary  alliances,  and 
political  ties I  described among voluntary associations in Chapter 
Three;  and the cooperative ventures among ministers,  as  well  as 
their coopting of secular leaders and their activities in school and 
government affairs  I described in Chapter Four.  Intergroup com-
petition was  too  strong in  the  first  years  to provide much  incen-
tive for joint ventures, but one could predict that, eventually, the 
entire  array  of  formal  organizations  and  institutions  would  be-
come  a  structure  of sorts,  an  uneasy  network  of  occasional  rela-
tionships  and  a  few  more  permanent  alliances  that  would  bind 
some  of  them  together  against  each  other  in  coalitions  of  like-
minded  people  and,  perhaps,  bring  many  of  them  together  if 
Levittown faced a threat from an outside enemy. 

Although  the voluntary  associations  and churches were  osten-
sibly nonpolitical, they could not really stay out of politics, Since 
the primary issues debated  in the community-taxes, status,  and 
schools--involved  almost  everyone  and  were  often  more  impor-
tant  than  the  organizational  agenda,  few  of  the  organizational 
leaders could  avoid  taking  sides  on  them-although,  of  course, 
they never did so  officially.  As  early as  1960,  when  a  civic  group 
was  holding  a  candidate's  night  for  school  board  hopefuls,  it 
could  not  find  a  single  community  leader,  in  either  secular  as-

The  Origin  of  a  Community 
sociations or  churches,  who could  be considered  neutral  on  the 
issues  then facing the schools.  Ultimately,  it had  to invite some-
one from  outside the community to chair the meeting. 

•  131  • 

THE EVOLUTION OF CLASS AND POWER STRUCTURES 

The  youthfulness  of  the  community  also  affected  the  develop-
ment of class and power structures, although they were shaped by 
distinctive qualities of Levittown as  welL  Despite the overriding 
importance of class in the origins and the definitional struggles of 
the  community's  groups,  no  clearly  visible  class  structure  had 
evolved in the first  three years of Levittown's existence. National 
distinctions and judgments regarding class and prestige pervaded 
its everyday life, of course, and the organizations sorted residents 
by  their  socioeconomic  level.  Even  so,  traditional  class  distinc-
tions  had  to  be  altered  somewhat.  People  did  not  know  each 
other  well  enough  to  have  information  about  their  parentage, 
and those who came for upward social  mobility carefully avoided 
reference  to  their  past histories.  Without knowledge  about  peo-
ple's income, with  the absence of very  poor and very rich neigh-
bors,  and  with  the  ever  present  fact  that  everyone  lived  in 
virtually the same house, it was difficult  to base judgments on in-
come.  People  in  the  $u,ooo houses  might  be  less  well  off  than 
those  in  the  $14,ooo  houses,  but  no  one  could  be  sure,  partic-
ularly  since  the  cheapest  house,  at  first  the  only  one  with  four 
bedrooms,  could  have  been  chosen  on  the  basis  of  family  size. 7 
Needless to say,  people who had part-time maids or two  new cars 
were suspected of greater affluence,  but they were  also  criticized 
for "showing off" or "trying to keep up with the Joneses," and on 
the  block,  their  status  was  lower  than  that  of  the  less  affluent 
neighbor trying hard to make ends meet. 

Occupation and education were  more reliable  indices of class 
position,  and  the  professional  received  more  deference  than  the 
factory worker, but many people had obtained some college  edu-
cation  and  the  majority  were  white  collar  workers.  Also,  many 
were working in new and unfamiliar technical jobs, for example, 
as  computer  programmers,  whose  status  could  not  easily  be 
judged by traditional indices. There were also new and obfuscat-
ing labels for  old  jobs,  and  not many people  could guess  that a 
"supply specialist"  was  really only a  high-grade  stock  clerk,  par-
ticularly  if  he  worked  for  a  large  and  well-known  corporation.

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

Finally, and  perhaps most  important,  the  intense  need  for  com-
munity leaders and organizational  participants in the early years 
temporarily  set  aside  traditional  class  distinctions  and  allowed 
people  of  low  status  to  become  prestigious  community  figures. 8 
Once  the  need  for  the  services  of  leaders  had  decreased,  people 
were  more  ready  to  notice  that  they  lacked  the  education,  job, 
speech  habits,  and  other refinements  that went with  high  status. 
Then,  more  typical  class  judgments could be  made  about  them. 
Eventually,  when  the  supply  of  leaders  with  sufficient  status 
catches  up  to  the  demand,  national  class  distinctions  will  prob-
ably  become  more  important  in  Levittown,  and  churches  and 
associations  may  be  ranked  by  the  same  criteria  that  obtain  in 
other  American  communities.  This  process  might  have  been 
hastened  if  Levitt  had  been  able  to  build  the  $2o,ooo-$25,ooo 
houses  he  had  intended,  but  because  of  Levittown's  image  as  a 
low-status  community,  sales  were  slow  and  construction  was 
halted after So  such houses had been sold. 9 

One likely deviation  from  the  standard class  hierarchy was al-
ready apparent.  In  many suburbs  the  professional  upper middle 
class  is,  by  virtue  of  its  income,  education,  and  occupation,  the 
highest-ranking group,  but  this  is  not  likely  to  happen  in  Levit-
town.  For  one  thing,  the  professionals  are a  small  minority,  and 
many  are  Jewish.  Although  there  is  almost  no  overt  or  even 
covert  anti-Semitism  in  Levittown,  a  predominantly  Protestant 
and Catholic  town  in a  predominantly  Protestant county  is  not 
likely to award highest status to a Jewish group. More important, 
the professional group has generally taken  unpopular stands, and 
many of  its  members are known to be in  Levittown  only  tempo-
rarily and will,  like other Mobiles,  eventually depart for  higher-
priced  suburbs.  This  group  is,  therefore,  a  deviant  minority.  If 
any single  population is  likely to have the  highest prestige in the 
community in the future,  it is  the managerial upper middle class, 
whose  political  stance  is  more locally oriented and whose  way  of 
life  is  more  in  line  with  what  most  Levittowners  would  like  to 
achieve. 

The class structure most likely to develop in Levittown is what 
might  be called  a  multinucleated one,  consisting of fairly  separ-
ate  working  class,  lower  middle  class,  and  upper  middle  class 
sectors,  each  of which will  consider itself  to be of most  worth,  if 
perhaps  not  of  highest  status,  in  the  community,  and  each  of 
which will award top prestige to its own organizational, political, 

The  Origin  of  a  Community

and  social  leaders.  In  a  bedroom  community,  in  which  few 
people are  economically dependent on  fellow  residents,  there  is 
less  need  to feel  inferior  to neighbors of higher income and edu-
cation,  particularly if one's own  group  is  politically and symbol-
ically stronger in the community by sheer weight of numbers.  Of 
course,  working class  people  know  that  they  have  less  education 
and  income  than  professionals  and  will  express  hostility  toward 
the  community  activities  of  the  latter,  but  as  long  as  they  can 
outvote  them,  class  difference  is  less  likely to be felt  as  status in-
feriority.  If changes  in  the  national  or  metropolitan  economy 
hurt the working class  and  leave  its  more  affluent  neighbors  un-
touched,  however,  feelings  of  status  inferiority  will  surely  de-
velop,  accompanied  by  demands  for  retribution  through  local 
political actions. 

The multinucleated structure may also  become  subdivided by 
religion,  separating  a  fundamentalist  Protestant  working  class 
segment  from  the  Catholic  one,  and  creating  Protestant,  Catho-
lic,  and  Jewish  segments  in  each  of  the  other  classes.  Religious 
segregation and conflict have  been present in Levittown from the 
start,  but these  had nothing to do with doctrinal or even denom-
inational  differences  and  often  represented  class  variations  that 
correlate  with  religion.  Some  were  gross  variations:  Catholics, 
particularly  the  less  affluent working class  ones,  who  had  to  sup-
port  both  public  and  parochial  schools,  were  obviously  against 
higher taxes.  Some differences were more subtle, as  when restric-
tive  lower  middle  class  people  in  conservative  Protestant  de-
nominations  objected  to  the  sale  of  liquor  and  the  holding  of 
bingo games, which were favored by expansive lower middle class 
residents  and  Catholics;  or  when  liberal  upper  middle  class 
Levittowners,  mostly  Jewish,  were  more  enthusiastic  over  the 
teaching  of  foreign  languages  in  elementary  schools  than  the 
largely  Protestant  managerial  upper  middle  class  or,  for  that 
matter,  than  lower  middle  class  Jews  who  had  fewer  academic 
ambitions  for  their  children.  The  correlation  between  religion 
and class  also  complicated  the alignment of the  political  parties. 
The Democrats  traditionally  favor  patronage  and  the  rapid  ex-
pansion  of  municipal  services  which  appeal  to  working  class 
voters,  but  in  Levittown,  this  conflicted  with  the  need  of  their 
Catholic  working class  constituents  to  keep  taxes  minimal.  The 
Republicans, traditionally  the  party  of low  taxes,  were  more  in-
clined  to defend  public school  budgets for  their  Protestant con-

•

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

stituents, particularly in a community in which Catholics were in 
a  plurality, and thus the party had to support higher school taxes. 
Since school  elections were nonpartisan,  these conflicts never  be-
came  visible,  but  they  complicated  internal  party  definitional 
struggles.  For a  time,  the  Republicans  advocated  lower munici-
pal  taxes  while  keeping quiet about  the  school  budget,  whereas 
the Democrats supported lower taxes across the board, but always 
suggested the need to expand municipal services as well. 

In a  community without sources  of employment,  the political 
power of residents is a major determinant of their position in the 
local class hierarchy, and Levittown's power structure may, there-
fore,  coincide even more than elsewhere with  the class structure. 
So  far,  political  fortunes  have  shifted  too  often  from  election  to 
election to suggest which group,  if any,  will  eventually have  the 
most  power.  Moreover,  until  now,  the  most  powerful  bloc  has 
been the  Levitt  organization.  As  the  largest single  landowner  in 
the township,  its contribution to the tax rolls, the influence of its 
building program  on  the  future  of  the community,  and  its  very 
real  interest  in  the  activities  of  the  municipal  government  in 
connection with its building program have made it the most per-
sistent  petitioner  for  action  by  the  government,  and  an  ever 
present interest group whose wishes need to be considered. As  the 
building program comes  to an end,  the  builder's involvement in 
the community and  his  power  will  decrease  and  perhaps  disap-
pear  entirely,  but  given  the  constant  arrival  of  new  purchas~s 
and  the  high  proportion  of  Transients  and  Mobiles  in  the 
present population, it is  too early to tell  which  population group 
will  ultimately  be  most  numerous  and  thus  most  influential. 

As  yet,  no  definable  and  stable  voter  blocs  have  emerged  in 
Levittown,  except  perhaps  a  Catholic  bloc  which  has  solidified 
around the issue of school  taxes.  Although politicians have some-
times  acted  (particularly  when  they  slated  candidates  for  town-
ship office)  as  if  there were other religious blocs,  blocs of earlier 
and  later arrivals,  and  "working men,"  white collar,  and  profes-
sional  blocs  as  well,  these  assumed  blocs  have  rarely  voted  as 
such.10  Nor  has  a  stable  set  of  leaders  developed  around  spe-
cific  issues,  because  of  the  turnover  of  office  holders,  and  be-
cause  most  issues  generate  somewhat  distinctive  constituencies 
and  decision-makers.  There have  been alliances  among Catholic 
and  less  affluent  non-Catholic  Levittowners,  and  anti-Levitt  co-
alitions  have developed among low-status and cosmopolitan resi-

The  Origin  of  a  Community 

•  135  • 

dents,  but  these  have  not  yet  become  stable  enough  to  become 
solid  interest  groups.  Consequently,  it  is  probably  premature  to 
identify a  power structure in  Levittown.  For the  time being,  the 
builder's  influence,  the  existence  of  the  Catholic  bloc,  and  the 
Democratic  party  leader's  ability  to  retain  his  hold on  the  party 
have  generated  a  somewhat  more  monolithic  local  power  struc-
ture,  less  varied  from  ·issue  to  issue  than  in  most  American 
communities. 

Since  the  people  who  described  themselves  as  Settlers  are  the 
only  ones  who  can  be  expected  to  remain  in  Levittown  in  the 
years to come, and may develop a  more stable voting pattern over 
time,  they  are  likely  to  be  the  most  influential  group  in  the 
future.  Because Settlers include an undue proportion of working 
class  and  less  affluent  lower middle class  people,  who are  for  the 
most part Catholics as  well,  a  Catholic bloc may well  become the 
single most  powerful  group  in  the community.  Since  it contains 
many of the least affluent residents who are particularly sensitive 
to status decrease  inside the community and are most  threatened 
by downward mobility,  it may also  become the most vocal  politi-
cal  constituency.  The  balance  of power  will  probably always  be 
held by the non-Catholic lower middle class, but because its party 
loyalty  is  weaker  and  because  it  includes  both  Transients  and 
Settlers, it may not be as  politically cohesive as  the  Catholic pop-
ulation. The absence of industry,  the relatively small  number of 
store  owners,  and  the  endemic  conflict  of  interest  between  the 
various shopping centers are likely to mean that businessmen will 
be  less  influential  than  they  are  in  other communities,  and  that 
on issues affecting them as well as  residents,  the latter will always 
win out.  On issues  that concern  the businessmen alone,  however, 
their ability to organize and to provide campaign funds will  pro-
vide them with sufficient power to achieve their ends. 

CRUCIAL  DECISIONS  AND  FACTORS  IN THE  ORIGIN  OF 
THE  COMMUNITY 

Of all the decisions and factors that made a community out of the 
strangers who purchased Levitt houses,  the most important were, 
of course,  the builder's.  His decision  to  build another Levittown 
near Philadelphia, with houses in a  $12,ooo-$I5,ooo price range, 
determined  the  age,  class,  and  religious  characteristics  of  the 
population, and these in turn influenced-perhaps determined-

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

the  informal  and  formal  groups  and  institutions  that  developed 
in  the  community.  Had  he  decided  to  build  more  expensive 
houses,  a  different  kind  of  community  would  have  resulted.  Of 
course,  his  decision  was  not  made  in a  vacuum;  it  was  based  on 
th~ firm's  previous success  in  building for  young middle-income 
people  and  its  belief  that  there  were  enough  of  them  in  the 
Philadelphia area to justify another Levittown. The specific loca-
tion  of  the  community  outside  what  was  then  Philadelphia's 
commuting area at  first  attracted  fewer  Philadelphians  than had 
been  expected,  resulting  perhaps  in  a  smaller  Catholic  popula-
tion,  and  its  proximity  to  an  Air  Force  base  and  the  research 
laboratories  near  Camden  brought  in  more  Transients.  On  the 
whole,  however,  the  population  that came  to  Levittown  was  not 
much different from  those  in the earlier Levittowns. 

A  second  important decision was  to buy enough land  to build 
u,ooo homes  and  to  announce  this  publicly,  which  in  turn  de-
cided a significant  number of External agencies  to start churches 
and  voluntary  associations.  This  resulted  in  the  immediate 
founding  of  many  groups,  speeded  up  their  formation,  and  re-
duced false  starts and mistakes,  thus assuring their survival  more 
quickly  than  would  otherwise  have  been  the  case.  It may  also 
have increased the number of national branches in the new com-
munity. 

Another  significant  Levitt  decision  was  to  concentrate  on  the 
building and  marketing  of  houses  and  to  leave  the  planning of 
local  institutions and facilities  to the residents.  This enabled  the 
old  residents  to  build county values  into  Levittown's school  sys-
tem,  government,  and  party  politics;  integrated  Levittown  into 
the  county  social  structure  more  quickly  than  would  otherwise 
have been the case;  led directly  to  the early definitional  struggles 
between  the  old  residents  and  the  newcomers,  but  also  encour-
aged  alliances  against  the  common  cosmopolitan  foe;  and  of 
course,  limited  possible  sources  of  resident  hostility  toward  the 
builder. 

A  fourth,  perhaps  more  important,  decision  was  to  subsidize 
the  operating  expenditures  of  the  schools,  which  artificially  re-
duced the tax rate for several  years and thus enabled less  affluent 
Levittowners  to  buy.  When  the  Levitt  subsidy  was  withdrawn, 
these  less  affluent  homeowners  were  among  the  most  insistent 
supporters  of  the  tax-reduction  forces  that  played  such  a  deter-
mining influence in Levittown politics. 

A fifth  decision,  to mix house types on the block, undoubtedly 

The  Origin  of  a  Community 

•  137  • 

affected  the  organizational  and  political  life  of  the  new commu-
nity.  If each  neighborhood  had  consisted  of a  single  house  type, 
three  different  types  of  neighborhoods  would  have  developed, 
each  with  slightly  different  social  and  political  interests.  For ex-
ample, a  neighborhood of three-bedroom  houses would have con-
centrated  childless  and  older  couples,  least  interested  in  school 
matters,  and  might  have  encouraged  more  organized  protest 
against  school  budgets.  More  neighborhood-based  voluntary  as-
sociations would have been formed and party politics might have 
been  more  organized  on  the  neighborhood  level,  with  conflicts 
developing between  groups of similar  ones. 

Of course, other builder (and  township)  decisions played some 
role  in  the  development  of  the  community,  but  none  were  as 
material.  Indeed,  most  developmental  processes  were  predict-
able  and  almost  inevitable  consequences  of  the  very  establish-
ment of a  new community.  For example,  the  inrush  of External 
agencies  could have  been predicted after  Levitt's announcement 
that  he  would  build  u,ooo  houses,  for  national  associations 
everywhere are expanding their membership rolls.  Limited social 
choices  on  the  block  inevitably  created  a  need  for  community 
sorting  organizations,  and  one  could  have  expected  that  minor-
ities  and  the  lonely  would  be  the  first  to  start  them.  Similarly, 
once organizations had been started,  their need to survive amidst 
competition  could  only  lead  to  the  hurried  selection  of  officers, 
the  relaxation  of  membership  requirements,  definitional  strug-
gles,  and the arrival  of  similar organizations which could not lag 
behind  in  the  competition  for  members  and  leaders.  It  is  not 
surprising,  therefore,  that  most  of  the  associations  and  churches 
now  in  the community were organized during the  first  couple of 
years,  drawing on  the initial  purchasers  to man  them and award-
ing  them  positions  of  power  and  status  that  they  held  on  to  in 
later  years.  The  end  result  may  have  looked  like  the  much  dis-
cussed  suburban  hyperactivity,  but  it  was  hyperactivity  on  the 
part of  organizations  rather  than  on  the  part of  residents.  Prop-
erly speaking, it was  not hyperactivity at all, but simply the rapid 
development of organizational  structures  in order  to  assure  their 
survival. 

Pre-Occupancy  Aspirations  and  Community  Origin 

One of my initial hypotheses,  that the origin of the community 
and the formation  of particular groups and institutions would re-
flect  the  aspirations  Levittowners  expressed  before  arrival,  was 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

clearly not supported by what actually happened.  Only a  few res-
idents  aspired  to  community  activities  before  they  came,  and 
Levittown's  organizations  were  started  instead  by  whatever  Ex-
ternal  agencies  were  interested  in  the  new  community  and  by 
residents  who  had  personal  loyalties  to  a  specific  group.  This 
would suggest  that  the aspirations and wishes  of the mass  of resi-
dents are irrelevaut, and that a new community can be organized 
by  individuals  and  even  nonresidents  who  are  determined  to 
realize  their  own  preferences,  provided  only  that  they  have 
enough  organizational  know-how  and  persistence  to  put  them 
over to the population. 

It  is  true  that  almost  anyone  could  start  an  organization  in 
Levittown,  but  it  is  also  true,  and  in  the  long run  more  impor-
tant,  that  the  organization's  survival  could  only  be  assured  by 
adapting it to the needs and· wishes of its members, so  that Levit-
towners could  determine  the  fate  of organizations  by  transform-
ing  what  was  started  for  them  to  their  own  preferences.  This 
transformation  process  began  even  before  Levittowners  moved 
into  their houses,  for  the  builder acted  in  their  behalf  by  using 
experience  collected  in  previous  Levittowns  to  design  the  com-
munity and  to  select  the  churches  to  which  he  would  give  free 
land.  The  churches  themselves  used  data  from  these  earlier 
Levittowns  to  determine  which  denominations  would  attract 
enough members to make  it worthwhile  to  build, and  they were 
careful  to  select  "starters"  who,  wanting  to  work  in  Levittown, 
would be responsive to their future congregants. 

The  national  associations  which  were  founded  Externally  al-
ways  began  by  finding  a  Levittowner  who  would  do  the  actual 
organizing, and limited  their role to getting the group safely  un-
der way.  They left  the  local  leaders  free  to  determine  member-
ship  qualifications  and  programs,  which  in  turn  enabled  these 
leaders to adapt themselves to the needs of people who wanted an 
organization without having to follow  the official  purposes of the 
group.  Usually,  the  process  was  almost  automatic,  for  g~ven the 
shortage of active  participants, any resident who proposed a  pro-
gram  idea  was  immediately  named  chairman  of  a  committee  to 
carry it out, and old army jokes  were revived warning people  to 
keep  their mouths shut at meetings  if  they did not want to "vol-
unteer"  for  leadership.  Leaders  who  were  not  responsive  to 
group demands or could not persuade members to carry out their 
proposals were extruded at the earliest opportunity. 

The  Origin  of  a  Community 

•  139  • 

Organizational  responsiveness  was  also  encouraged  by  the 
availability  of  general  or  instrumental  leaders,  individuals  who 
wanted to lead but had no strong preferences for a  specific organ· 
ization  or  program  and  were  thus  flexible  enough  to  provide 
leadership  to  any  group  or  cause  willing  to  put  them  in  office. 
Three  types  of general  leaders  played  an  important  role  in  the 
community's origin. 

Some people were motivated by such strong personal  needs for 
being leaders  that, given  the early shortage of leaders,  they were 
willing  to  become  general  leaders  instead  of  waiting  for  the 
specific  organizations  they  preferred.  One woman  explained  her 
transformation  from  a  specific  to  a  general  leader  as  follows:  "I 
wanted to be active when I  first came here;  I  have a need for  it in 
spurts  and  this  was  the  year  I  needed  it.  I  had  been  cooped  up 
with  three children  for  a  whole year  before  and  had a  desperate 
need to be active. The Sisterhood happened to be the first  thing I 
was asked to be active in and so  I  became active  in it.  Now I'm a 
little sorry because I  want to organize a nursery school more,  but 
I have an obligation to the Sisterhood." 

The most frequent and most reliable source of general  leader-
ship  came  from  occupationally  motivated  individuals,  however. 
The lawyers, salesmen, realtors, and local retailers who needed to 
advertise  their  presence  in  the  community,  and  had  to  do  so  at 
once,  provided  the  community  with  leadership  talent  at  a  time 
when  other residents  were  still  settling down  in  their  houses  or 
exploring the  block for  friends.  Since  their livelihood depended 
on  it,  they  were  ready  to  move  into  any  organization  which 
needed  them,  to  encourage  its  growth  so  as  to obtain  more  per-
sonal  publicity,  community  stature,  and  new  business  contacts, 
and  to  lead  it in  whatever  directions  the  membe~ preferred  or 
accepted.  Most  of  these  general  leaders  enjoyed  their  organiza-
tional activity,  for  it required many of the same social skills they 
used  in their jobs:  "I like to join and it's good  for  business,"  one 
salesman  pointed out. "I feel  bad every  time I  go past the school 
and see a meeting I  hadn't known about. But I'm not involved in 
any of the organizations  .  .  .  the only organization  I  really care 
about is  the church." This man switched jobs several  times until 
he found a company which encouraged his joining, and as he put 
it,  "They  said  the  more  groups  I  joined,  the  better,  as  long  as 
they're not political." 

A  third  type  of general  leader functioned  in  interstitial capac-

•  140  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

ities.  He was  usually  a  man  looking for  a  better job, and was  in-
terested  in  organizational  activities  that would  publicize  him  in 
the community.  He provided  leadership  in  the  interstices of  the 
community,  wherever  there  were  "holes"  not  being  filled  by 
others  or  activities  that  had  to  be  done  quickly.  Interstitial 
leaders  gravitated  particularly  to  the  political  parties  and  were, 
of  course,  hoping  for  political  jobs  as  a  reward  for  their  work. 
Lawyers also functioned as  interstitial leaders, making themselves 
available  to organizations as negotiators, arbitrators, and brokers. 
Bound  by  codes  of  ethics  that  guaranteed  clients  secrecy,  they 
were  particularly  useful  as  go·betweens  and  "fixers"  to  resolve 
conflicts  among community groups and  between  petitioners and 
government. 

Unintended  organizations  were,  by  definition,  responsive  to 
some  sudden  community need.  These brought forth  unintended 
leaders,  people  who  had  not _thought  about  being active  before 
coming to Levittown and who often became leaders because they 
felt  they  had  to,  not  because  they  wanted  to.  Occasionally,  such 
people discovered  hidden leadership needs  and skills  in  the  pro-
cess.  One woman, who had not belonged to an organization since 
high school,  began by starting a neighborhood club to relieve her 
loneliness,  and  before  long,  she  was  named  president  of  Levit-
town's  largest  church  women's  club.  "I  didn't  want  it  and  I 
didn't campaign  for  it,"  she  later  explained,  "but some  women 
asked  me  and  I  said  yes.  Now  I  love  it.  Before  Levittown,  I  al-
ways  kept things inside." She was exceptional, however, and most 
founders  who  lacked  leadership needs or talents  soon  passed  the 
responsibility to more suitable colleagues. 

Politicians  had  to  be  particularly  responsive,  not  only  to  get 
themselves  elected,  but  at  first  also  to  recruit  workers  into  the 
party. The fate  of the old residents on  the Township Committee 
and  the  Board  of  Education  had  demonstrated  clearly  how  the 
voters  would  react  to  government  unresponsiv«ness.  Even  the 
builder, who had  the most power in the community and was  not 
accountable to anyone except prospective purchasers, was respon· 
sive  to  resident demands when  they did not conflict with  higher 
priorities.  He  eliminated  plans  for  a  small  shopping  center  and 
several  gas  stations  upon  resident  protest,  and  in  Ig6o,  decided 
not  to  build  an  $I I ,ooo  house  because  he  felt  his  earlier  cus-
tomers  would  resent  his  attempt  to  attract  lower-income  pur-
chasers  to  the  community.  When  resident  demands  did conflict 

The  Origin  of  a  Community 

•  141  • 

with higher priorities,  the builder was apt to be less responsive-
as  in the case of expanding the schools  to reduce classroom  size-
but when  enough  Levittowners cared,  they could  force  him  into 
responsiveness  by  voting  against  government  officials  who  had 
supported his requests. 

What  brought  a  community  into  being  in  Levittown,  then, 
was not the pre-occupancy aspirations of the residents, but rather 
a  complex process of external  initiative and subsequent  internal 
transformation  that  produced  organizations  and  institutions 
which  reflected  the backgrounds and  interests of  the  majority of 
the  population.  The  new  Levittowners  had  not  thought  much 
about their future community life  before  they  arrived,  but once 
they had settled down,  they chose  to enter the community being 
founded for them and then to alter it to meet their requirements. 
These choices were  based  less  on explicit  individual  wishes  than 
on requirements themselves generated by  the community;  that is, 
people went  into and reshaped  the  organizations  on  the  basis  of 
needs  that  had  developed  in  the  situation  in  which  they  found 
themselves  in  Levittown.  The  principal  situation  was  the  pres-
ence  of the  kinds of people with whom  they  lived,  for  insofar as 
Levittowners used  organizations  for  sorting  purposes  and  sorted 
themselves as  they  did,  they were reacting  to  the population  mix 
that  had  come  about  in  Levittown.  Ultimately,  then,  the  com-
munity evolved as  it did because  of the kinds of people who  had 
decided, each on  his own,  to  buy a  house in Levittown, organiza-
tional  and  political  life  uniting  them  for  cooperative  ventures, 
segregating  them  for  competitive  ones,  and  bringing about class 
and  other conflicts  to  determine  which  elements  of  the  popula-
tion  mix would  have  power  over  the  whole. 

As a result, it would be absurd to argue that Levittown evolved 
out of a conspiracy,  either on the  part of a  profit-seeking builder 
to entice buyers into his development or on  the  part of  national 
organizations intent on adding to  their membership rolls among 
an  essentially  captive  audience.  Indeed,  few  Levittowners  ob· 
jected  that  many  of their organizations were  national  ones  initi-
ated from outside, and I am not sure that very many even noticed 
it.  Not everyone  was  happy with  what  Levitt  had  wrought,  and 
many  were  unhappy  over  the  conflict  generated  by  definitional 
struggles and by township politics, yet the events that made them 
unhappy  were  rarely  conspiratorial  or dictatorial  measures,  but 
almost  always  the outcomes of organizational  and  political  com-

promises required by the need to establish a  community quickly 
and to cope with the diverse requirements of that community. In 
the  end,  the  community  was  an  expression  of  the  lower  middle 
class  culture  of  the  majority,  altered  somewhat  to  accede  to  the 
demands of insistent minorities. 

Prerequisites for  Community Origin 

Although  it is  dangerous  to  generalize from  one  new  commu-
nity, at least  seven  prerequisites seem  to be necessary,  or at least 
helpful,  for  the  formation  of  new  communities  like  Levittown. 
First,  the  new  populatitm  must  be  culturally  and  emotionally 
"open," receptive to interaction with strangers, even from a some-
what  different  background,  and  trusting  enough  to  participate 
with them in joint enterprises.  At the same  time,  sufficient social 
and cultural homogeneity is required to enable strangers to talk to 
each  other  without  immediate  conflict  over  values,  and  equally 
important,  they  must  face  a  common  situation  that  places  them 
all  in  the  same  boat.  Second,  the  population  must  have  some 
needs  that cannot be met in the  home and on the block.  Third, 
group  formation  is  enhanced  if  there  is  sufficient  population 
heterogeneity to create minorities or socially isolated groups who 
need organizations and who are socially skilled enough to partici-
pate in them1in order to eliminate their isolation. 

Fourth,  there must be residents with some  incentive to under-
take  founding  and  leadership  tasks.  In a  heterogeneous commu-
nity,  these must include general  leaders who are willing to carry 
out membership demands  that may conflict  with their own  pref-
erences.  Community  prestige  is  usually  a  sufficient  incentive  for 
recruitment of needed  leaders,  particularly  if  the class  structure 
is  open  enough  to  allow  low-status  people  to  achieve  upward 
mobility through leadership.  A  most effective second incentive is 
occupational,  and  if  there are  sufficient  lawyers,  insurance  sales-
men, and  merchants  in the  population,  they  will  perform  many 
of the needed general  leadership roles.  Fifth, leaders with  previ-
ous  experience  can  reduce  organizational  floundering,  and  may 
prevent the dissolution of groups during the early interorganiza-
tional competition. 

Sixth,  organizational  formation  and  community  activity  gen-
erally are enhanced by conflict and crisis.  Participation  in politi-
cal  and civic affairs  is  assured  if there is  disagreement,  especially 
if the most important goals people bring with them into the com-

•  143  • 

The  Origin  of  a  Community 
munity are  threatened.  If a  population  is  homogeneous  and  its 
political  institutions are responsive  to  its  needs,  it is  unlikely  to 
participate  except  to  vote,  and  even  then  may  do  so  in  limited 
number,  leaving  the  decision-making  task  to  a  small  elite.  If a 
population  is  heterogeneous,  however,  and  the  demands  of  a 
significant  proportion  are  downgraded  or  ignored,  these  are 
likely to form pressure groups and political factions. 

Seventh,  community  participation  requires  physical  facilities 
for meetings and some organs of communication to publicize the 
existence  of organizations.  The  latter  can  be  created  as  part  of 
the  origin  process,  but  meeting  rooms  and  small  auditoriums 
must be available  to facilitate  the creation  of organizations with 
more members than can fit into a living room. 

THE NATURE  OF A NEW COMMUNITY 

Whether or not  the  outcomes  of  the diverse  processes  described 
above result in a  community depends in  part on one's definition 
of  the  term.  Strictly  speaking,  what  emerged  in  Levittown  was 
the  typical  array of municipal bodies and  individual  associations 
which worked together when common interests were at stake, but 
competed  most  of  the  time.  Many  associations  also  had  ties  to 
county, state, and national bodies that were more important than 
their ties to other Levittown organizations.U 

These  groups,  taken  together,  were  commonly  thought  to  be 
"the  community,"  mainly  because  their  activities  took  place 
within  the  township  limits  and  their  jurisdictions  began  and 
ended  there.  Their influence  was  limited  to  the  population  liv-
ing  within  those  limits,  but  they  could  act  on  this  population, 
make  rules  regulating  its  behavior,  and  even  speak  in  its  behalf 
to  people  who  lived  outside.  For  example,  an  outsider  curious 
about  the  ideas  and  attitudes of  Levittown  women  would  prob-
ably ask  the Women's  Club, and  its  leaders would feel  that  they 
could  speak  for  all  Levittown  women.  In  reality,  they  did  not 
even  represent  all  who  belonged  to  their  own  or  the  other 
women's  clubs,  but  neither  did  any  other  visible  community 
group, and thus each  felt  itself free  to speak  for  the community, 
and-more important-make demands on  the community which 
were claimed  to  benefit  it.  Residents tended to accept the formal 
organizations  as  representing  the  community,  for  when  I  inter-
viewed leaders of less  formal  clubs, explaining that I  was  making

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

a study of the community, they were often reluctant to talk about 
their  groups, because  they  did  not consider them to  be a  part of 
that body they defined as "the community." 12 

Since  most  Levittowners did  not  participate actively  in  the so-
called  community  organizations,  the  community  that  had  been 
originated in their names was of minor importance in their lives. 
What involved them deeply was their house and the lot on which 
it stood,  the  adjacent  neighbors  and  perhaps  the  block,  friends 
elsewhere  in  Levittown,  and  the  particular  church  or  organiza-
tion  in  which  they were  active. 13  If one could measure  "sense of 
community,"  it embraced  only  these,  but not  the community or 
even the neighborhood in which  they had bought.  Neighborhood 
boundaries  had  little  meaning,  for  units  of  1200  families  were 
too  large  for  face-to-face  relations,  and  even  the  so-called  neigh-
borhood clubs  usually  recruited  from  only a  block  or two.  Chil-
dren  who  attended  neighborhood  schools  may  have  felt  neigh-
borhood  loyalty,  based  on a  childish  belief  that  their school  was 
better  than  others,  but since  some  students  were  bused  in  from 
other  neighborhoods,  not  even  the  schools  were  pure  neighbor-
hood organizations. Some adults described their neighborhood as 
the  best  and  friendliest  in  town,  but  further  probing  indicated 
that  they  were  really  talking  about  their  own  block,  although 
some insisted that other neighborhoods were inferior because  the 
houses were built closer  together or were of poorer construction. 
The feelings  about  the  block,  neighbors,  friends,  and  favorite 
organizations  were  sometimes  translated  into  a  more  general 
identification  with  Levittown  as  the  best  possible  place  to  live, 
and  some  people  took  pride  in  a  winning  football  team  or  an 
organizational  achievement  that  lent  distinction  to  Levittown. 
These  feelings  were  neither  intense  nor  of  long  duration;  they 
were generated  less  by intrinsic qualities of the community than 
by  the  desire  to  put  Levittown  "on  the  map"  in  the  unending 
competition  with  other  communities.  "The  map"  was  usually 
Burlington  County,  but  when  L.Y.S.A.  asked  the  Township 
Committee to finance a  local  team  to play  in the county baseball 
league,  it  pointed  out  that  this  league  was  regularly  scouted  by 
the majors,  so  that a  $woo municipal  subsidy might one day en-
able a  Levittowner to represent the community in  the  American 
or  National  League.  Even  the  name  change  that  transformed 
Levittown into Willingboro was  justified largely by  the negative 
headlines about the town  in  the  Philadelphia area  press,  and re-

The  Origin  of  a  Community 

•  145  • 

fleeted  less  a  concern  about  the  community  than  the  belief  that 
the  name  created  a  community  image  (and  a  persona  for  its 
residents) which they wanted the outside world to respect. 

There were,  of course,  attempts  to  instill  "community  spirit" 
by  merchants,  party  leaders,  club  presidents,  municipal  officials, 
and  other  boosters  hoping  to  motivate  their  constituents  to 
greater effort for  their particular agency. Some residents believed 
deeply in community spirit and praised Levittowners for  having 
more of it than their previous neighbors, but what they meant by 
it was  a  willingness  to act unselfishly  toward other Levittowners. 
For example, a  man who missed a  night's work and pay  in order 
to coach  his  Little  League  team was described as  having commu· 
nity spirit, and so  were  the people who sent donations and cards 
to a just-widowed Levittowner and prayed for a  little girl, new in 
the community, who would be dead of cancer in six months. This 
kind  of community spirit  reflected  mutual  help  patterns  among 
neighbors more than an attitude toward the community, and de-
veloped only in  personal  or organ1zational crises and disasters.  It 
could  not  have  been  generated-and  would  not  have  been  ex· 
pected-for events and political issues which  might deprive some 
Levittowners and  benefit others.  Perhaps if  the community were 
threatened  by  powerful  outside  forces  which  would  hurt  the 
community as  a  whole  or deprive  every  Levittowner,  an  intense 
identification  with  the  community  might  be  created,  but  most 
people  hoped such a  threat would never develop.  Even  if it did, 
the  resulting  cohesion  would  be  only  transitory,  disappearing 
once  the  threat  was  removed  or leading  to disaffection  with  the 
community and  eventual  departure  if  it could  not  be  removed. 
By any traditional  criteria,  then,  Levittown could not  be con· 
sidered  a  community.  It was  not an  economic  unit whose  mem· 
hers  were  dependent  on  each  other  for  their  livelihood,  and  it 
was not a social  unit for there was  no reason or incentive for peo· 
pie  to  relate  to  each  other as  Levittowners  on any  regular or re· 
curring basis.  And Levittown was  clearly not a  symbolic unit, for 
the  sense  of community  was  weak.  If Levittown  was  a  commu-
nity,  and  of  course  it  was,  it  could  best  be  defined  as  an 
administrative-political  unit  plus  an  aggregate  of  community-
wide associations within a  space that had been legally established 
by  William  Penn  and  his  associates  as  a  township  some  three 
hundred  years  before. 14  As  such,  it  provided  residents  with  a 
variety of services and required them  to act in a  limited number 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

of community roles-for example, as voters, taxpayers, and organ· 
izational participants-but these roles encouraged division rather 
than cohesion. 

Indeed,  just  because  Levittown  was  only  a  loose  network  of 
groups  and  institutions  it  was  possible  for  these  to  develop 
quickly  and  in  large  numbers.  Had  the  community  been  a  co-
hesive  social  body,  there  would have  been  fewer  groups,  for  the 
founding  of  additional  ones  would  have  signified  an  intrusion 
into a  tight-knit social  body.  Conversely,  not being a social  body, 
Levittown needed to find  groups,  people, and symbols to make it 
appear as a body to other communities-which were equally busy 
persuading  Levittowners  that  they  were  social  bodies.  The  at-
tempts of  the builder and,  later,  the  township fathers  to require 
stores and gas stations to adopt a  uniform pseudo-Colonial fat;ade 
for their buildings was,  likewise, an architectural means for creat-
ing a  unity and cohesion  that  did  not  exist  in  the  social  system. 
I  do  not  mean  to  downgrade  Levittown  as  a  community,  for 
my  observations  apply  equally to  all  other communities,  urban 
and  suburban,  and  probably  even  to  most  communities  of  the 
past,  including  those  now  celebrated  as  cohesive  units. 15  More· 
over,  Levittown  probably  displayed  a  greater  sense  of  commu-
nity, social  cohesion,  and symbolic  (as  well  as  spatial)  unity than 
established  and  more  typical  settlements,  if  only  because  it  was 
new and  because  it was  atypical  in its  architectural  homogeneity 
and the youthfulness of its population.  It also had a  stronger self-
image as  a  community  than  Levittown,  Long Island,  which,  be-
ing spread over many municipalities, has had to debate with itself 
whether  it  was  a  community or not. 16  My  argument  here  is  not 
with  Levittown,  then,  but with  critics  who  seek  to  find  a  social 
unit in the community where none exists, and with romantic city 
planners, abetted by nostalgic social critics, who want to "revive" 
a  sense  of community  that never  was  save  in  their  imagination, 
instead of planning for the effective functioning of and improved 
living conditions  in  those  aggregates  to which we give  the name 
"community." 

Newness and Deliberate Innovation 

City  planners usually  reserve  the  term  "new  town"  for  a com-
munity  that contains  enough  employment opportunities  to  pro-
vide jobs for  about half of its  residents.  In this sense,  Levittown 
was  not a  new  town,  for even  if it had been able to attract indus-

The  Origin  of  a  Community 

•  147  • 

try,  not  enough  land  was  reserved  for  this  purpose  to  employ 
more  than  a  fraction  of  all  Levittowners.  Physically  Levittown 
was,  of course,  new,  yet  in  many ways  it  was  not a  new commu-
nity. The people who moved  there wanted  a  new house but not a 
new  life,  and  the  community  they  established  was  'not  particu-
larly  novel.  None  of  its  organizations,  institutions,  and  public 
agencies were  distinctive,  or different from  those  one might find 
in a community of other young families of similar socioeconomic 
level.  Indeed, many factors  in its origin discouraged  novelty and 
innovation.  Both  External  and  Internal  founding  encouraged 
the  establishment  of  previously  existing  organizations  and 
churches  in  Levittown,  and  once  started,  these  as  well  as  Unin· 
tended  groups  looked  desperately  for  people  with  "experience." 
As  a  result,  new  organizations  adopted  old  structural  and  pro-
grammatic  ideas  that had worked  elsewhere.  In fact,  the need  to 
assure  the  survival  of  the  group and  develop  a  routine  discour-
aged  innovation  and  experimentation,  which  took  place  either 
because  there was  no other alternative or because  only a  new so-
lution  would  fit  the needs  of the moment.  For example,  the  Re-
publican invention of the "bandwagon" resulted from  the lack of 
experienced campaigners and speechmakers and  the need  for  an 
alternative  method  of reaching  the  voters.  When  proposals were 
advanced  as  deliberate  innovations  and  experiments  they  were 
likely  to  be  rejected,  because  people  resented  being  used  as 
guinea  pigs,  particularly  when  the  call  for  innovation  and  ex-
perimentation came  from  the  cosmopolitans.  Levittowners  were 
perfectly  willing  to  innovate  and  experiment  in  their  own 
homes, but not at the community level. 

The fact  remains,  however,  that  Levittown  was  planned  from 
scratch by the builder and the consultants who worked with him, 
~nd by the External agencies who came in to found organizations 
before Levittown was  even six months old. It is,  therefore, worth 
while  asking  whether  deliberate  planning  could  have  gone  one 
step  further  and  introduced innovations prior to  the opening of 
the community,  presenting the arriving Levittowners with a  fait 
accompli.  Would  early  initiative  combined  with  organizational 
know-how have enabled school,  church, and organizational  plan-
ners  to  lay  out a  novel  community structure  which  would  have 
been so  appropriate  to  the  Levittowners'  needs  that  they  would 
have  accepted  it and  thus made  Levittown a  really new  commu· 
nity? 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

Much of the know-how was available; from information on the 
price range and  the number of houses  to  be built in  Levittown, 
an  organizational  planner  could  have  used  (as  did  the  research 
departments  of  the  Protestant  denominations)  data  from  previ-
ous Levittowns to predict fairly accurately the array and range of 
organizations and  institutions  that would be relevant to the new 
population.  He might even have been able to start them, for once 
Levittown was  occupied, anyone who decided  to set  up a  specific 
organization  thereby  generated  processes  which  encouraged  its 
survivaL  That  the  planner  could  also  have  programmed  the 
memberships and activities of these groups is,  however, doubtfuL 
Unless he could have accurately predicted what minorities would 
find  themselves  at  a  loss  on  the  block  and  what  sorting  criteria 
would  eventually  have  emerged  out  of  the  population  mix,  his 
plans would surely have  been diverted once  the Levittowners ar-
rived,  and  the  organizations  would  have  been  changed  to  meet 
the  needs  that  developed  after  their  arrivaL  Prior  planning 
might  even  have  increased  the  d~version,  for  the  new  residents 
would  have  been  suspicious  that  organizations  already  in  exis-
tence  were  set  up  for  some  ulterior  purpose  on  the  part  of  the 
builder  or  the  old  residents,  and  might  therefore  have  stayed 
away from them altogether. 

Perhaps Levitt's consultants and the old residents were right in 
their  unwillingness  to  plan  without  constituents,  to  schedule 
only  the  institutional  shells  and  let  the  Levittowners  fill  in  the 
details  once  they  arrived.  In  fact,  more  attention  should  have 
been paid to these shells.  For example, more accurate population 
estimates  might  have  ensured  elementary  schools  with  enough 
classrooms  to  keep  class  size  at  the  intended leveL  An  organiza-
tional  planner  might  also  have  been  helpful  to  small  organiza-
tions which  lacked  the communications skills  to  find  enough eli-
gible  or  interested  people  among  the  mass  of  Levittowners,  and 
he  might  have  been  able  to  bring  organizations  into  being  to 
provide  activities  and  viewpoints  not  available  in  the  commu-
nity.  As  of  1961,  there were  no  mental  health clinics  or counsel-
ing centers, almost no recreation opportunities for girls,  no high-
culture organizations, no local  and national  political groups that 
offered  the community alternative points  of view-for example, 
the Americans for Democratic Action or a local citizens' planning 
group.  Given  the  small  number  of  residents  with  the  requisite 
interests,  however,  it  is  not  certain  whether  such  groups  could 

The  Origin  of  a  Community 

•  149  • 

have survived even  if they had been started by a  professional  or-
ganizer. 

Ultimately,  any  attempt  at  significant  organizational  innova-
tion would probably have foundered  because  Levittowners came 
not to build a  new community but to move  into a  new  house  in 
which  they could  carry on old ways  of family life,  neighbor rela-
tions,  and  civic  activity.  Perhaps  the  only new  communities are 
utopian ones formed deliberately by people who have decided  to 
alter  their  life  according  to  a  common  plan,  and  such  people 
would  not  have  considered  buying  in  Levittown.  A  few  Levit-
towners  came  to  start a  new  life  or  make  significant  changes  in 
the old one, and some  came with a fragile  hope  that,  somehow,  a 
virginal community would avoid the problems and conflicts of an 
established one.  This hope was  soon  dashed  by  the  necessities  of 
the origin  process.  As  one of  the  first  arrivals  recalled  later:  "I 
was  so  naive  before  I  moved here.  I  didn't  think there would  be 
any juvenile delinquency;  I  thought only angels were  moving in. 
It never occurred  to  me  that  people are  people no matter where 
you  live."  She  put it well,  for  people being people,  they brought 
their  cultures  with  them  and  the  community  they  established 
thus  only  re-created  old  life  styles  and  institutions  on  new  soil.

1.  Clark has  called  these  "packaged"  suburbs  because  their  builders 
provided  at  least  some  of  the  community  facilities  that  go  with 
the  house.  The term  is  apt,  but it underemphasizes  the extent  to 
which  the  population,  once  arrived,  shapes  the  contents  of  the 
package  to suit its  own needs.  See  Clark,  pp.  6-7.

that  family  size  remained  a  significant  determinant  of  house 
choice. 

8.  On the block, where leaders were ordinary residents and behaved 
more  in line with  their  backgrounds,  the  usual  status  judgments 
could  be  made;  indeed,  neighbors  often  wondered  how  people 
who acted as if they were of low status could be so successful out-
side  the  block. 

9·  Since the houses were neither visibly more statusful nor function-
ally much better than  the cheaper models,  few  Levittowners were 
interested  in  exchanging  them  for  what  they  had,  although  in 
Levittown,  Pennsylvania,  a  neighborhood  of  more  expensive 
houses did attract more affiuent and higher-status people who had 
become  dissatisfied  with  their  cheaper  models.  By  1966,  Levitt 
began  to  build  higher-priced  houses  again,  locating  them  (as 
planned  earlier)  on  the  Rancocas  River  at  the  extreme  edge  of 
the  community. 

10.  The politicians,  of course,  prefer voting  blocs,  since  these  can  be 
reached more easily during election campaigns. However., not even 
the  Catholic  bloc  leaders  could  control  the  vote  of  their  coreli· 
gionists. The small neighborhood of higher-priced houses and the 
larger  neighborhoods  that  were  settled  later  immediately  organ-
ized  civic  associations  to  defend  their interests  against  a  govern-
ment  then  controlled  by  the  first  arrivals,  and  new  areas  have 
sometimes voted differently from older ones on some issues.

IN  PART  TWO,  MY  FOCUS  SHIFTS  FROM  LEVITTOWN  TO  THE  LEVIT· 
towners,  and  from  a  historical  to  a  cross-sectional  perspective-
from  the  community  to  the  people  and  the  way  they  live  at  a 
specific  point  in  time.  Some  critics  charge  that  suburban  life  is 
socially,  culturally,  and  emotionally  destructive,  and  that  the 
causes  are  to  be  found  in  the  nature  of  suburbia  and  the  move 
from  the  city.  Testing  their  charges  requires  evaluation  of  the 
quality  of  Levittown  life  and  measurement  of  Levittown's  im-
pact on  its residents  to  determine what changes  in  behavior and 
attitudes  have  actually  resulted  from  the  move. 

Many  of  the  findings  on  Levittown's  impact are  based  on  in-
terviews  with  two  sets  of  Levittowners,  one  a  nearly  random 
sample  of 45  buyers  in Somerset  Park,  the  first  neighborhood  to 
be settled, and the second, of 55  others in that neighborhood who 
had moved  there from  Philadelphia, here called the Philadelphia 
or  city  sample.  The  two  samples  were  interviewed  during  tg6o 
and  1961,  after  they  had  lived  in  Levittown  two  to  three  years, 
and this determines  the  period on which  the cross-sectional  anal-
ysis  is  reporting.  (The  random  sample  was  also  interviewed  just 
after  its  arrival  in  Levittown,  thus  providing  data  on  the  im-
mediate  impact of  the move  as  well.)  Both samples are  small  and 
not entirely random, so  that the statistics cannot supply the final

scientific  proof  that statistics often  imply,  but  they  do  illustrate 
what happened to people as a  result of moving to Levittown. 

THE  QUALITY  OF  SOCIAL  LIFE 

Perhaps  the most  frequent  indictment of suburban life  has  been 
leveled  against  the  quality  of  social  relationships.  The  critics 
charge  that the suburbs  are  socially  hyperactive  and  have  made 
people  so  outgoing  that  they  have  little  time  or  inclination  for 
the  development  of  personal  autonomy.  The  pervasive  homo-
geneity of the  population has depressed  the vitality of social  life, 
and the absence of more heterogeneous neighbors and friends  has 
imposed  a  conformity  which  further  reduces  the  suburbanite's 
individuality.  Indeed, studies showing the importance of physical 
propinquity  in  the  choice  of  friends  have  been  interpreted  to 
suggest  that  physical  layout,  rather  than  people,  determines  the 
choice  of  friends.  Because  many  suburbanites  are  Transients  or 
Mobiles,  they  have  been  accused  of  wanting  social  companions 
only for  the duration of their stay, disabling them for more inti-
mate friendship. 1 

Evidence  from  Levittown  suggests  quite  the  opposite.  People 
report an  accelerated social  life,  and in fact  looked forward  to  it 
before  moving to  Levittown.  The major reason  for  the  upswing 
is  indeed  homogeneity,  but an  equally  appropriate  term  might 
be "compatibility." Propinquity may initiate social contact but it 
does  not  determine  friendship.  Many  relationships  are  indeed 
transient,  but this  is no reflection on  their intensity. Finally. con-
formity  prevails,  although  less  as  malicious  or  passive  copying 
than as  sharing of useful  ideas.  In short, many of the phenomena 
identified by the critics occur in Levittown but their alleged con-
sequences  do  not  follow.  Levittowners  have  not  become  out-
going,  mindless  conformers;  they  remain  individuals,  fulfilling 
the  social  aspirai:Ions  with  which  they  came.  To be  sure,  social 
life  in Levittown has its costs,  but these seem minor compared to 
its rewards. 

Neighboring 2 

About  half  the  Levittowners  interviewed  said  that  they  were 
visiting  more  with  neighbors  than  in  their  former  residence; 
about a  quarter said  less,  and the remaining quarter reported no 
change.8  The greatest  increase  was  reported  by  the  people  who 

Social  Life:  Homogeneity  and  Conformity 

•  155  • 

said they had wanted to do more visiting,  particularly those  who 
had  had  little opportunity  for  it in their  previous  residence.  As 
one Philadelphian said, "We used  to be with the in-laws and with 
my mother;  we  didn't bother with the neighbors before."  Others 
had  lacked  compatible  neighbors;  people  living  in  apartments 
had  found  few  opportunities  to  get  acquainted,  and  those  in 
older  or  transitional  areas  had  found  their  fellow  residents  un-
suitable. This was  as  true of former suburbanites and small-town 
residents  as  of  those  from  cities,  and  affected  owners  as  well  as 
renters.  One  homeowner  explained,  "Here  in  Levittown  I  have 
more in common;  where  we  lived  before,  the neighbors were all 
my mother's age." 

In addition to  the desire  to do more neighboring,  the  increase 
resulted  initially  from  the  newness  of  the  community  and  the 
lack of shopping facilities and other places for daytime activities. 
But these reasons were mentioned far less often than  the "friend-
liness"  of the neighbors, and this in  turn was  a function of popu-
lation  homogeneity.  One  Levittowner,  describing  her  next-door 
neighbor, said,  "We see eye  to  eye  on  things,  about  raising  kids, 
doing  things  together with  your  husband,  living  the  same  way; 
we  have  practically the same  identical  background."  Conversely, 
the  people who  reported  less  neighboring were  those  who could 
not find  compatible  people  on  the  block:  older ones,  some  (but 
not all)  people  of  highest  and  lowest  status,  and those  who  had 
difficulties  in  relating  to  neighbors,  particularly  second  genera-
tion  Jewish  women  from  Philadelphia  who  were  used  to  living 
among Jewish  neighbors. 4  A  handful  wanted  to continue spend-
ing their social  life with relatives or preferred to  have nothing to 
do with n;ighbors. 

Of course,  some  friendliness  was  built into  the  neighbor rela-
tionship, for  people needed each other for  mutual aid.  In a com-
munity far  from  the  city,  women  are  cut off  from  relatives  and 
old friends-as well as  from commuting husbands-so that readi-
ness  to  provide  mutual  aid  is  the  first  criterion of  being a  good 
neighbor. This includes not only helping out in emergencies, but 
ameliorating periodic loneliness by being available for occasional 
coffee-klatsching and offering  informal  therapy  by being willing 
to  lister.  to  another's  troubles when  necessary.  Helping out also 
offers an opportunity-rare in everyday life-to practice  the  dic-
tates  of  the  Judeo-Christian  ethic,  and  brings  appropriate  emo-
tional  rewards.  The  reciprocity  engendered  by  mutual  aid  en-

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

courages-and  allows-neighbors  to  keep  a  constant  watch  on 
each  other,  as  they do  in established  neighborhoods everywhere. 
One  night  I  drove  out  of my driveway  at a  slightly  higher  than 
usual  speed,  and my next-door neighbor came over  to find  out if 
anything was  wrong,  although  later he wondered whether in  his 
desire to be a good neighbor he had violated the norms of privacy 
and was  being  too  nosy.  The mutual observation  that makes  the 
block a  goldfish  bowl  goes  on mainly among adjacent neighbors, 
for with houses only ten feet apart,  they see each other frequently 
and  have  to  maintain  friendly  relations  if  that  is  at  all  possible. 
More  distant  neighbors  could  be  ignored,  however.  Indeed,  a 
Levittowner  who  had  moved  from  a  cohesive  working class  dis-
trict  said,  "It's  not  like  Philadelphia  here.  There  you  might 
know  someone  four  blocks  down  the  road  as  well  as  your  next-
door  neighbor.  Here  you  don't  know  people  down  the  road." 
The  block  was  a  social  unit only  to  assure  a  modicum  of  house 
and lawn care,  beyond which  there was  no  obligation for  neigh-
bors to associate. 

Even propinquity did not require visiting. Although a number 
of studies have shown  that social  relationships are influenced and 
even  determined by  the site  plan,  this was  not  the case  in  Levit-
town.5  Since  Levittown  was  laid  out with  curved  blocks,  houses 
facing each  other across front and back,  there were relatively few 
neighbors  with  whom  one  had  constant  and  involuntary  visual 
contact.  Sometimes,  even  relationships  with  directly  adjacent 
neighbors  could  be  restricted  to  an  exchange  of  hellos.  For  ex-
ample, it took more than a year for me to meet the occupants of a 
house diagonally across  the street from mine, even though we had 
been saying hello since  the first weeks of occupancy. Another per-
son  told me he had never even met his next-door neighbor. Thus, 
despite  a  fairly  high  building density-five  to  six  houses  to  the 
acre-there  was  no  pressure  to  be  sociable.  Neighboring  rarely 
extended more than three or four  houses away  in each direction, 
so  that the "functional neighborhood" usually consisted of about 
ten to twelve  houses at the most, although people did say hello to 
everyone on  the  block. 6  The boundaries of  the functional  neigh-
borhood  were  delimited  either  by  physical  barriers  or by  social 
isolates who interrupted the flow of social relations. 7 

A  more systematic  test of the propinquity  theory was  made by 
asking interview respondents  to rank the amount of visiting with 
their  six  most  adjacent  neighbors.  If  propinquity  alone  had

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

determined visiting,  one or two of the  most adjacent  neighbors, 
those  on  the right and left sides,  should  have  been  visited  most 
often. As  Table 4  indicates,  however, about three quarters of all 
visiting was equally distributed between these  two and the neigh· 
bor across  the street, who was a  little farther away,  and the latter 
was actually visited most often. If people's first and second choices 
are  combined,  the  data  show  that  31  per cent  chose  right-hand 
neighbors,  an  equal  number  left-hand  ones,  29  per  cent  those 
across the street, and  the rest other adjacent ones. Thus, distance 
does  not  affect choice  of  the closest  neighbors,  although  it does 
discourage visiting  the less  adjacent ones,  and  particularly  back-
yard neighbors.  Because of the  too-foot depths of the lots and the 
heat  of  the  New  Jersey  summer,  people  made  little  use  of  the 
backyards, and the 200 feet  between houses reduced visiting con-
siderably.8 

Some  propinquity studies  have  found  that  visiting  is  affected 
by  the  location  of  the  front  door,  and,  among  women,  of  the 
kitchen  window  from  which  they can  see  their  neighbors  while 
doing  housework.  This  was  not  the  case  in  Levittown.  If the 
front  door  had  been  significant,  owners  of  the  Cape  Cod  and 
ranch houses should have  chosen  their right-hand and across-the-
street neighbors most often;  those  of the  Colonial  houses  should 
have  chosen  their  left-hand and  across-the-street  neighbors.  The 
data  show  that  Cape  Cod  owners  visited  most  often  across  the 
street,  but equally  between  right- and  left-hand  neighbors;  the 
ranch owners chose the left-hand neighbors twice as  often as  their 
other neighbors;  and the Colonial owners showed a  slight prefer-
ence  for  left-hand  neighbors.8  In  the  "kitchen window test,"  the 
expected pattern was found only among Cape Cod house owners, 
but  not  the  other  two.10  Had  location  been  the  prime  deter-
minant  of  friendship  choice,  neighbors  should  also  have  been 
mentioned as  friends more than other Levittowners. Respondents 
said, however, that only 35 per cent of the five  couples they visited 
most  frequently  lived  on  their  street,  and  31  per  cent  said 
that none of these  favorite  couples lived on their street. 11  More-
over, propinquity affected some types of social gatherings but not 
others;  baby showers,  cookouts, and  barbecues drew only nearby 
neighbors;  more  formal  parties  involved  mainly  guests  from 
other streets and neighborhoods. 12 

Since  most  of  the  interview  questions  were  about  adjacent 
neighbors,  the findings are only a  partial  test of the propinquity 

Social  Life:  Homogeneity  and  Conformity 

•  159  • 

theory.  They suggest  that a  sizeable  functional  distance discour-
ages  visiting,  but  that  among adjacent neighbors,  people  choose 
not  the closest or the ones  they see  most often, but the ones they 
consider  most  compatible.  Indeed,  fully  82  per  cent  of  the  re-
spondents mentioned compatibility as  the reason for choosing the 
neighbor they visited most frequently.  If the site plan had forced 
some neighbors into constant visual  contact-as do  court or cul-
de-sac schemes-they might have reacted by increased visiting (or 
intense  enmity  if they were  incompatible),  but the block  layout 
gave Levittowners the opportunity for choice. 

Neighbor relations among adults were also affected by the chil-
dren,  for  children are neighbors  too,  and  their mingling was  de-
termined  almost  entirely  by  age  and  propinquity.13  The  rela-
tively  traffic-free  streets  and  the  large  supply  of  young  children 
enabled mothers  to limit  their supervision  of  the  children's out-
door play;  and the overall compatibility, to give youngsters a free 
choice  of  playmates.  But  children  were  likely  to  quarrel,  and 
when -this  led  to  fights  and  childish  violence,  their  quarrels  in-
volved  the  parents.  Half the  random sample  had  heard  of quar-
rels  among  neighbors  on  their  block,  and  81  per  cent  of  these 
were  over  the  children.  Adults  quarreled  most  often  when 
childish misbehavior required punishment and parents disagreed 
about methods. If the parents of fighting children agreed  on dis-
cipline,  each  punished  his  child  the  same  way  and  the  incident 
was  soon  forgotten.  If they  disagreed,  however,  the  parent who 
believed in harsh punishment often felt  that the more permissive 
parent,  not  having  punished  "enough,"  was  accusing  the  other 
child  of  having  been  at  fault.  A  single  parental  disagreement 
might be forgiven,  but if it happened repeatedly, an open  break 
between  neighbors  could  result.  Of  seventeen  quarrels  about 
which interview respondents were knowledgeable, nine had been 
concluded  peacefully,  but  in  the  other eight cases,  parents were 
still  not talking to each other.  In one case,  two neighbors finally 
came  to blows and had to be placed on a  peace  bond by the mu-
nicipal court. 

Another type of adult quarrel  involved physical disciplining of 
children  by  neighbors.  Some  people  believe  that  only  parents 
should spank their children; others, that neighbors have the right 
to do so  if the child misbehaves out of sight of the parents. When 
a neighbor punishes another's child, he not only takes on a quasi-
parental  role but, by implication, accuses  the parents of not rais-

•  160  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

ing  and  watching  their  children  properly.  In  one  such  case, 
where a  neighbor punished a  little boy for sexual exhibitionism, 
the parent never spoke to him again. 

Basically,  differences  over discipline reflect  class  differences  in 
child-rearing.  Middle  class  parents  tend  to  be  somewhat  more 
permissive  than  working class  ones,  and when  two children  play 
together, the middle class child may be allowed to act in ways  not 
permitted  to  the  working  class  one.  Also,  working  class  parents 
administer physical  punishmen·t more freely,  since  this  is  not  in-
terpreted  as  a  withdrawal  of  affection,  whereas  middle  class 
families  reserve  spankings  for  extreme  misbehavior.  Then,  as 
children  get  older,  practices  change.  The working  class  child  is 
given more freedom, and by comparison, the middle class child is 
given  much  less.  He  is  expected  to  do  his  homework  while  his 
working  class  peers  may  be  playing  on  the  streets.  Middle  class 
people  who  observe  this  freedom,  as  well  as  the  working  class 
parents'  tolerance  of  childish  profanity,  interpret  it  as  neglect. 
In  some  cases,  middle  class  families  even  prohibit  their  chil-
dren  from  playing  with  working  class  children.  Prohibition  is 
feasible  if children  are  old  enough  to respect  it or if  parents su-
pervise  the  children's  play.  Younger  children  cannot  be  pre-
vented  from  playing  with  each  other,  however,  and  parental 
quarrels may result. If the working class children are older and in 
a  minority, as  they often are on the block,  they may become out-
casts,  and since they are mobile,  may look around for other, simi-
larly discredited  companions.  Out of  this  may  come  a  gang  that 
vandalizes  hostile  middle class  society. 14  People of low  status ex-
perienced  (or  saw)  the  most  quarrels,  for  72  per  cent  of  blue 
collar  respondents  reported  quarrels  in  their  neighborhood,  as 
compared to only 41  per cent of the middle class. 

The repetition of parental conflict over children's quarrels can 
lead  to  increasing  estrangement,  because  other  values  and  be-
havior  patterns  also  differ  between  the  classes.  For  example,  in 
one  case,  what  began  as  a  series  of  minor  disagreements  about 
child-rearing  was  soon  reinforced  by  critical  comments  on  the 
part  of  the  middle  class  people  about  the  working  dass  neigh-
bor's laxity  toward  his  lawn and  his  taste  for  expensive automo-
biles. All  of these disagreements spiraled  into considerable hostil-
ity over  a  year's  time.  Eventually,  one  of  the  feuding  neighbors 
may move out-usually the middle class family  which has  greater 
resources to go elsewhere. 

Social  Life:  Homogeneity  and  Conformity 

•  161  • 

If the  overall social  climate  of the  block  is  good,  other  neigh-
bors will  try to patch up conflicts between parents. On one block, 
a  child  hit  another  with  a  toy,  drawing  blood  and  requiring  a 
doctor.  The mother of the  injured youngster admitted  it  was  his 
fault and suggested  to  the other mother  that  the  two  children  be 
kept apart for a  few  days.  However, she did not punish her child 
at once,  and  this  was  resented  by  the  other  mother  (of  working 
class  background).  She,  in  turn,  forbade  her  child  to  see  the 
guilty  one,  and  both  she  and  her  husband  broke  off  with  his 
parents  as  well.  After  about  a  week,  however,  the  feud  ended. 
Each mother told other neighbors of what had happened, and the 
woman  whose  child  had  provoked  the  incident  finally  learned 
that  the  other  mother  thought  he  had  not  been  properly  pun-
ished.  She  thereupon  let  it be  known  among her neighbors  that 
the child had in fact been punished on the day of the incident.  In 
a  few  days  the  message  reached  its  intended  destination,  where-
upon  the  mother whose  child  had been hit invited  her neighbor 
and  another,  neutral,  neighbor  to  coffee.  The  coffee-klatsch  re-
solved  the  differences,  but  only  because  the  block's  friendly 
climate had provided for the prior and circuitous communication 
that allowed the one mother to learn that the guilty child had in-
deed  been  punished.  Had  communication  been  poorer,  other 
differences  between the  two neighbors might  have been  invoked 
to increase the conflict.  Indeed, when the block's social climate is 
poor,  the struggle will  be limited  to  the involved  parents, for  no 
one wants to  take sides.  If a  family  becomes  enmeshed  in  battles 
with  a  number of neighbors,  however,  that family is  likely  to  be 
quickly ostracized, regardless of the social climate. 

The  importance  of compatibility is  extended also  to  relation-
ships  that  do  not  involve  children,  and  is  underscored  by  the 
problems encountered by neighbors who differ significantly.  One 
potential  trouble  spot  was  age.  Although  some  elderly  Levit-
towners  were  able  to  assume  quasi-grandparental  roles  toward 
the  street's  children,  others  were  lonely  and  uncomfortable  a-
mong the  young families,  and  enthusiastic gardeners  were  upset 
when  children  romped  over  flowerbeds  and  carefully  tended 
lawns.  The  difficulty  was  exacerbated  by  the  builder's  prohibi-
tion of fences,  a  clause in the deed restriction  that was later vio-
lated on a number of blocks and actually taken to court. 

Class  differences  also  expressed  themselves  in areas  other  than 
child-rearing. 15  Upper  middle  class  women-whose  concept __ of

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

after-housework  activity  did  not  include  coffee-klatsching,  con-
versation  about  husbands,  homes,  and  children,  or  gossiping 
about  the  neighbors--rejected  and  were  rejected  by  the  neigh-
bors. So were women who were especially active in organizational 
life.  Perhaps  the  major  problems  were  faced  by  working  class 
people who had been  used  to spending their free  time with rela-
tives  or childhood friends  and found  it hard  to  become  friendly 
with  strangers  (especially  middle  class  ones).  The  change  was 
particularly distressing  to  those  who  had  spent all  their  lives  in 
the neighborhood in which they grew up. If, when they moved to 
Levittown,  they  were  sufficiently  "open"  to  respond  to  friendly 
neighbors and found others of working class  background nearby, 
they  could  adapt;  if  not,  they  were  virtually  isolated  in  their 
houses.  For the  latter,  a  small  minority  to  be  sure,  life  in  Levit-
town  was  hard.18  Ethnic  differences  were  also  a  barrier  between 
neighbors.  Groups without a strong subcommunity were isolated, 
notably  a  handful  of  Japanese,  Chinese,  and  Greek  families. 
Some neighbors came with ethnic and racial  prejudice, and anti-
Semitism,  though  rare,  could  be  justified  by  the  old  charge  of 
Jewish  clannishness 17  and  by  class  differences  resulting  from 
generally higher incomes among Jews.18 

A  final  barrier was  sexual,  and  this affected  the women  whose 
husbands worked  irregular schedules and might be home during 
the day.  A  woman neighbor did not visit  another when  her hus-
band  was  home,  partly because  of  the  belief that  a  husband  has 
first call on his wife's companionship,  partly to prevent suspicion 
that her visit might be interpreted as  a sexual  interest in the hus-
band.  This practice is  strongest among working class  women,  re-
flecting  the traditional class norm that people of the opposite sex 
come  together  only  for  sexual  reasons,  and  becomes  weaker  at 
higher  class  levels;  in  the  upper  middle  class  there  are  enough 
shared  interests  between  men  and  women  to  discourage  suspi-
cion.19  The  sexual  barrier  sometimes  inhibited  neighbor  rela-
tions among women whose  husbands traveled as  salesmen,  pilots, 
or seamen, forcing their wives to associate with each other. 

Couple  Visiting 20 

Although  40  per  cent  of  the  Levittowners  reported  more 
couple  visiting  than  in  their  former  residences,  the  change  was 
not  quite  as  great  as  for  neighboring,  requiring  as  it  does  the 
compatibility of four rather than two and more of a commitment 

Social  Life:  Homogeneity  and  Conformity 

•  163  • 

toward  friendship  as  well. 21  Like  neighboring,  the  increase  in 
couple  visiting  resulted  principally  from  the  supply  of  compat-
ible  people,  although  it was  also  encouraged  significantly  by  or-
ganizational  activity;  members  of  voluntary  associations  and  of 
the highly organized Jewish subcommunity reported the greatest 
increase. 22  Even  the  people  who  had  not  wanted  to  do  more 
visiting before they moved  to Levittown  found  themselves doing 
more  if  they  were  in  organizations.  Whether  organizational 
membership  encourages  more  visiting or vice  versa  is  not  clear; 
most  likely,  the  same  gregariousness  that  induces  visiting  also 
makes  "joiners,"  for  the  latter  have  more  friends  in  Levittown 
than the unaffiliated. 

Couple visiting is  governed by narrower criteria of compatibil-
ity  than  neighboring,  for  religiously  mixed  marriage  partners 
reported  more  neighboring,  but  found  themselves  doing  less 
couple  visiting  in  Levittown. 28  Older  people  and  people  of 
lower status also reported decreases.  Evidently, friendship choices 
were  affected  by  religion,  and  people  who  straddled  two  had 
trouble finding  friends.  So  did people  who  straddled  the  classes, 
for some Jewish women who had found Jewish organizations not 
to  their liking,  wanting more "cultural" activities  but not being 
quite  up  to  the  civic  programs  of  the  cosmopolitans,  reported 
that their social  life suffered. 

The patterns of couple visiting in Levittown question two  fea-
tures  of  the  suburban  critique-the superficiality  of friendships 
and  social  hyperactivity.  According  to  many  critics  of  suburban 
life,  the  transience  of  the  population  induces  transient relation-
ships which  end with departure  from  the !=Ommunity.  Transient 
relationships  undoubtedly exist;  one Levittowner, who had gone 
back  to  visit  old  friends  in  her  former  community,  returned  to 
report  ttiat  she  no  longer  had  much  in  common with  them  and 
that  they  had  been,  as  she  put  it,  "development friends."  Other 
Transients  established  close  friendships,  however,  and  one  fam-
ily,  temporarily  transferred,  returned  to  the  block  to be close  to 
friends  even  though  they would have preferred to move  into one 
of Levitt's newer houses. 

The criticism of "development" friendship harbors an implicit 
comparison with "bosom" friendship, assumed to have existed in 
the  past,  but there  is  no evidence  that  the comparison  is  empir-
ically  valid.  Close  friendships,  I  suspect,  typically  develop  in 
childhood  and  adolescent  peer  groups,  and  can  continue  in  a 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

static  society  where  people  have  as  much  in  common  in  adult-
hood as  in childhood.  But in American society,  and especially  in 
the middle class;  geographical and social  mobility often separates 
people  who  have  grown  up  together,  so  that  shared  interests 
among childhood friends are rare.  Often, only nostalgia keeps the 
relationship  going.  Many  Levittowners  talk  about  close  friends 
"at home,"  but they see  them  so  rarely  that the current strength 
of  the  friendship  is  never  properly  tested.  Instead,  they  develop 
new  friends  at each  stage  of the life cycle or as  they move up oc-
cupationally and Qevelop  new  social  and leisure  interests.  Close-
ness  is  not  replaced  by superficiality,  but permanent friendships 
give  way  to  new  and  perhaps  shorter ones  of similar closeness.24 
Whether or not this relationship is  desirable depends on one's 
values.  People  today,  particularly  the  middle  classes,  are  more 
gregarious than those of the past.  The working class,  restricted in 
social  skills  or content  to  range  within  a  smaller,  perhaps closer, 
network  of  relatives  and  childhood  friends,  comes  nearest  to re-
taining the  traditional  "bosom" friendship.  But these  people,  in 
my  research  as  in  many  other studies,  report difficulties  in mak-
ing new  friends  as  their life conditions  change. 2~ 

The  critics'  charge  that  suburbanites  indulge  in  hyperactive 
visiting  to counteract boredom.and loneliness brought on by the 
lack of  urbani'ty  in  their  communities is  equally mistaken.  Com-
ing from  academia where the weekend brought parties, and hav-
ing just lived in an Italian working class neighborhood in Boston 
where  people  maintained  an  almost  continual  "open  house,"  I 
was  surprised at how little entertaining took  place among Levit-
towners.26  Although  people  often  had  visitors  on  Sunday  after-
noons, weekend evenings were not differentiated from  the rest, a 
fact  that  should  be  obvious  from  the  high  ratings  of  television 
programs on the air at that time.  I  would guess  that, on the aver-
age,  Levittowners  gathered  informally  not  more  than  two  or 
three  times  a  month and  gave  formal  parties about once a  year, 
not counting those around Christmas and New Year's Eve.  Social 
life  in Levittown was not hyperactive  by any stretch of the imag-
ination,  except  perhaps  in  the  first  few  months  of  putting  out 
feelers.  I  suspect  that  the  critics  either confuse  the  early  hyper-
activity  with  the  normal  pattern  once  life  had  settled  down,  or 
they generalize from observations in upper middle class  suburbs, 
where partying is a major leisure activity. 

Admittedly,  the critics could question  my assumption  that an 

Social  Life:  Homogeneity  and  Conformity 

•  165  • 

increase  in  social  life  is  equivalent  to  an  improvement  in  its 
quality, and argue  that  it represents  instead an escape  from  per-
vasive  boredom.  If the  Levittowners  had  found  their  social  life 
boring,  however,  they  would  either  have  cut  it  down  or  com-
plained about greater boredom. The data indicate just the oppo-
site,  for  those  visiting more were  less  bored (and vice  versa),  and 
besides,  if  social  life  had  been  as  dull  as  the  critics  claim,  why 
would the interview respondents have been so  enthusiastic about 
the friendliness of their fellow residents? 

THE  PROS  AND  CONS  OF 
POPULATION  HOMOGENEITY 2T 

The suburban critique is  quite emphatic on  the subject of demo-
graphic  homogeneity.  For  one  thing,  homogeneity  violates  the 
American  Dream  of  a  "balanced"  community  where  people  of 
diverse  age,  class,  race,  and  religion  live  together.  Allegedly,  it 
creates dullness  through  sameness.  In addition,  age  homogeneity 
deprives  children-and  adults--of  the  wisdom  of  their  elders, 
while  class,  racial,  and  religious  homogeneity  prevent  children 
from  learning how to live in our pluralistic society.  Homogeneity 
is  said  to make people callous  to  the  poor, intolerant of Negroes, 
and  scornful  of  the  aged.  Finally,  heterogeneity  is  said  to  allow 
upward mobility, encouraging working and lower class  people to 
learn  middle class  ways  from  their more advantaged neighbors. 28 
There is  no question  that  Levittown  is  quite homogeneous  in 
age and income as compared to established cities and small towns, 
but such comparisons are in ~any ways  irrelevant.  People do not 
live in the political  units we call  "cities"  or "small  towns";  often 
their  social  life  takes  place  in  areas  even  smaller  than  a  census 
tract.  Many such  areas  in  the  city  are  about  as  homogeneous  in 
class  as  Levittown, and slum and high-income areas,  whether ur-
ban or suburban,  are  even  more so.  Small  towns  are notoriously 
rigid in  their separation of rich and poor, and  only appear to  be 
more  heterogeneous  because  individual  neighborhoods  are  so 
small. All  these considerations effectively question the belief that 
before  the  advent  of  modern  suburbs  Americans  of  all  classes 
lived  together.  Admittedly, statistics compiled for cities and sub-
urbs as  a  whole show  that residential  segregation  by class and by 
race  are  on  the  increase,  but  these  trends  also  reflect  the  break-

•  166  •  ' 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

down  of rigid class  and caste  systems  in  which  low-status  people 
"knew their  place,"  and which  made residential  segregation  un-
necessary_ 

By ethnic and religious criteria,  Levittown  is much  less  homo-
geneous  than  these  other areas  because  people  move  in  as  indi-
viduals rather than as groups, and the enclaves found  in some re-
cently built urban neighborhoods, where 40 to 6o per cent of the 
population comes from one ethnic or religious group, are absent_ 
Nor  is  Levittown  atypically  homogeneous  in  age;  new  commu-
nities  and  subdivisions  always  attract  young  people,  but  over 
time,  their  populations  "age"  until  the  distribution  resembles 
that of established communities.29 

Finally,  even  class  homogeneity  is  not  as  great  as  community-
wide statistics would  indicate.  Of three  families  earning $7ooo a 
year,  one  might  be  a  skilled  worker  at  the  peak  of  his  earning 
power  and  dependent  on  union  activity  for  further  raises;  an-
other, a white collar worker with some hope for a  higher income; 
and the third, a young executive or professional  at the start of his 
career.  Their  occupational  and  educational  differences  express 
themselves  in many variations in life style, and if they are neigh-
bors, each is  likely to look elsewhere for companionship.  Perhaps 
the  best  way  to  demonstrate  that  Levittown's  homogeneity  is 
more  statistical  than  real  is  to  describe  my  own  nearby  neigh-
bors.  Two  were  Anglo-Saxon  Protestant  couples  from  small 
towns,  the breadwinners employed as  engineers;  one an agnostic 
and  a  golf  buff,  the  other a  skeptical  Methodist  who  wanted  to 
be  a  teacher.  Across  the  backyard  lived  a  Baptist  white  collar 
worker from  Philadelphia and his Polish-American wife, who had 
brought her foreign-born  mother with her  to Levittown;  and an 
Italian-American  tractor operator (whose ambition was  to own a 
junkyard)  and  his  upwardly  mobile  wife,  who  restricted  their 
social  life to a  brother down the street and a host of relatives who 
came  regularly  every  Sunday  in  a  fleet  of  Cadillacs.  One  of my 
next-door  neighbors was  a  religious  fundamentalist  couple from 
the Deep South  whose  life revolved  around the church;  another 
was an equally religious Catholic blue collar worker and his wife, 
he  originally  a  Viennese  Jew,  she  a  rural  Protestant,  who  were 
politically liberal  and as  skeptical about middle class ways as  any 
intellectual. Across  the street,  there was another Polish-American 
couple, highly mobile and conflicted over their obligations to  the 
extended  family;  another  engineer;  and  a  retired  Army  officer. 

Social  Life:  Homogeneity  and  Conformity 

No wonder  Levittowners were puzzled when a  nationally known 
housing expert addressed them on the "pervasive homogeneity of 
suburban life." 

Most  Levittowners were  pleased  with  the diversity  they found 
among  their  neighbors,  primarily  because  regional,  ethnic,  and 
religious  differences  are  today  almost  innocuous  and  provide 
variety  to  spice  the  flow  of  conversation  and  the  exchange  of 
ideas.  For example, my Southern neighbor discovered pizza at the 
home of the Italian-American neighbor and developed a  passion 
for it, and I  learned much about the personal rewards of Catholi-
cism  from  my  Catholic  convert  neighbors.  At  the  same  time, 
however,  Levittowners  wanted  homogeneity  of  age  and  income 
--or rather,  they wanted neighbors and friends with common in-
terests and sufficient consensus of values to make for informal and 
uninhibited  relations.  Their  reasons  were motivated  neither  by 
antidemocratic  feelings  nor  by  an  interest  in  conformity.  Chil-
dren  need  playmates  of  the same  age,  and  because  child-rearing 
problems vary with age,  mothers like to be near women who have 
children of similar age.  And  because  these  problems also  fluctu-
ate  with  class,  they  want  some  similarity  of  that  factor-not 
homogeneity of occupation and education so  much as  agreement 
on  the  ends  and  means  of caring for  child,  husband,  and  home. 
Income similarity is valued by the less affluent, not as an end in 
itself,  but  because  people  who  must  watch  every  penny  cannot 
long  be  comfortable  with  more  affluent  neighbors,  particularly 
when  children come  home  demanding  toys  or clothes  they  have 
seen next door.  Indeed,  objective measures of class are  not  taken 
into account in people's associations at all,  partly because they do 
not  identify  each  other  in  these  terms,  but  also  because  class 
differences  are  not  the  only  criterion  for  association. 30  Some-
times  neighbors  of  different  backgrounds  but  with  similar  tem-
peraments find  themselveS  getting along nicely,  especially  if they 
learn to avoid activities and topics about which they disagree. For 
example,  two  women  of diverse  origins became  good  friends  be-
cause  they were  both  perfectionist housekeepers married to  easy-
going  men,  although  they  once  quarreled  bitterly  over  child-
rearing values. 

But Levittowners also want some  homogeneity for  themselves. 
As  I  noted  before,  cosmopolitans are  impatient with  locals,  and 
vice versa;  women who want to talk about cultural and civic mat-
ters  are  bored  by  conversations  about  home  and  family-and, 

•  168 '. 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

again,  vice  versa;  working class  women  who  are  used  to  the  in· 
formal  flow  of talk with relatives  need to  find  substitutes  among 
neighbors with  similar experience.  Likewise,  young people  have 
little in common with older ones, and unless they want surrogate 
parents,  prefer  to  socialize  with  neighbors and friends  of similar 
age.  Some Levittowners sought ethnic and religious homogeneity 
as  well.  Aside  from  the Jews and  some  of  the  Greeks,  Japanese, 
and  the  foreign-born  women  of  other  nations,  observant  Catho-
lics  and  fundamentalist  Protestants  sought  "their  own,"  the 
former  because  they were  not entirely at ease  with  non-Catholic 
neighbors,  the  latter because  thei•:  time-consuming church activ-
ity  and  their  ascetic  life  styles  set  them  apart  from  most  other 
Levittowners.  They  mixed  with  their  neighbors,  of  course,  but 
their couple visiting was  limited  principally  to  the  like-minded. 
Because of the diversity of ethnic and religious backgrounds,  the 
Philadelphia  sample  was  asked  whether  there  had  been  any 
change in the amount of visiting with people of similar "national 
descent or religious preference";  30  per cent reported a decrease, 
but  20  per  cent  reported  an  increase.31  Those  doing  less  such 
visiting  in  Levittown  also  said  they  were  lonelier  than  in  Phila-
delphia. 

Most  people  had  no  difficulty  finding  the  homogeneity  they 
wanted  in  Levittown.  Affluent  and  well-educated  people  could 
move  into  organizations  or  look  for  friends  all  over  Levittown, 
but older people and people of lower income or poorly educated 
women  were  less  able  to  move  around  either  physically  or  so-
cially.  Women from  these groups often did not have a  car or did 
not  know  how  to  drive;  many were  reluctant  to  use  baby-sitters 
for  their  children,  only  partly  for  financial  reasons.  Hetero-
geneity,  then, may be a mixed blessing, particularly on the block, 
and  something can  be  said  for  class  and age  homogeneity. 

The alleged  costs  of  homogeneity were also  more  unreal  than 
the  critics  claim.  It  is  probably  true  that  Levittowners  had  less 
contact  with  old  people  than  some  urbanites  (now  rather  rare) 
who still live in three-generation households.  It is  doubtful, how-
ever,  that  they  had  les~ contact  with  the  older  generation  than 
urban  and  suburban residents  of  similar age  and  class,  with  the 
exception of the occupational Transients, who are far from  home 
and  may  return  only  once  a  year.  Whether  or  not  this  lack  of 
contact with grandparents affects  children negatively  can  only be 
discovered by systematic studies among them.  My observations of 

Social  Life:  Homogeneity  and  Conformity 

•  169  • 

children's relations with grandparents suggest that the older gen-
eration is strange to them and vice versa,  less as  a  result of lack of 
contact than of the vastness of generational change. 

This  is  also  more  or  less  true  of adult  relationships  with  the 
older generation. Social change in America has been so  rapid that 
the  ideas  and  experiences  of the  elderly are  often anachronistic, 
especially  so  for  young  mobile  Levittowners  whose  parents  are 
first  or  second  generation  Americans.  Philadelphia  women  who 
lived  with  their  parents  before  they  moved  to  Levittown  com-
plained  at  length  about  the  difficulties  of  raising  children  and 
running a  household  under  those  conditions,  even  though  sorQe 
missed  their  mothers  sorely  after  moving  to  Levittown.  A  few 
found  surrogate  mothers among  friends  or  neighbors,  but chose 
women  only slightly older  than  themselves  and  rarely consulted 
elderly neighbors. As  for  the husbands,  they were,  to a  man, glad 
they had moved away from  parents and in-laws. 

That suburban  homogeneity deprives children of contact with 
urban pluralism and "reality" is also dubious. Critics assume that 
urban  children  experience  heterogeneity,  but  middle  class  par-
ents--and working class  ones,  too--try hard to shield  them  from 
contact with conditions and people of lower status. Upper middle 
class  children may be taken on  tours of the city,  but to museums 
and  shopping  districts  rather  than  to  slums.  Indeed,  slum  chil-
dren, who are freer of parental supervision, probably see  more of 
urban diversity  than anyone else,  although  they do not often  get 
into middle class areas. 

The  homogeneity  of  Levittown  is  not  so  pervasive  that  chil-
dren  are  shielded  from  such  unpleasant  realities  as  alcoholism, 
mental  illness,  family  strife,  sexual  aberration,  or juvenile delin-
quency  which  exist  everywhere.  The  one  element  missing  on 
most  Levittown  blocks--though,  of  course,  in  many  city  neigh-
borhoods too--is the presence of Negro families.  Although young 
Negro  women  came  from  nearby  Burlington  to  work  as  maids, 
there  were  only  two  Negro  families  in  the  three  neighborhoods 
built before Levittown's integration, and about fifty  in the three 
built since then.  Most Levittown children are unlikely to see any 
Negroes  around  them  and  will  not  have  real  contact  with  them 
until  they  enter  junior  high  school.  But  it  is  not  at  all  certain 
that  mere  visual  exposure-to  Negroes  or anyone  else--encour-
ages learning of pluralism and tolerance.  Children pick up many 
of their attitudes from parents and peers, and these are not neces-

•  170  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

sarily  pluralistic.  If visual  exposure  had  the  positive  effects  at-
tributed  to  it,  city  children,  who  see  more  Negroes  than  sub-
urban  children  do,  should  exhibit  greater  racial  tolerance.  In 
reality they do  not;  indeed,  the middle class child growing up in 
a  white  suburb  may  be  more  opposed  to  segregation  than  one 
raised in an integrated city.  This is  not a justification for segrega-
tion,  but a  suggestion that visual exposure is  no sure means to in-
tegration. 

A  generation  of  social  research  has  demonstrated  that J;tcial 
andQtlle.rJorms __ Qf  iml!gr<ltiQn  oc~!-!r when diverse people can in-
teract frequently  in equal and noncompetitive situations.82  Here 
the  suburbs  are  at an  advantage  when  it comes  to religious  and 
ethnic integration, but at a disadvantage for  racial  and class inte-
gration,  for  aside  from  residential  segregation,  suburban  high 
schools  bring  together  students  from  a  narrower variety  of resi-
dential  areas than do urban ones.  Again,  mere  diversity  does not 
assure  the  kind  of interaction  that encourages  integration,  and  a 
school  with  great  diversity  but  sharp  internal  segregation  may 
not be as  desirable as one with less diversity but without internal 
segregation.  Judging by life  on  the block  in Levittown,  maximal 
diversity  and  extreme  heterogeneity  encourage  more  conflict 
than  integration,  and  while  conflict  can  be  desirable  and  even 
didactic, this is only true if it can be resolved in some way.  People 
so different from  each other in age or class that they cannot agree 
on anything are unlikely to derive  much  enrichment from heter-
ogeneity. 

A  corollary of  the  belief in diversity  as  a  stimulant to enrich-
ment  holds  that  working class  and  lower class  people  will  bene-
fit-and  be improved-by living among middle  class  neighbors. 
Even  if one  overlooks  the patronizing class  bias  implicit  in  this 
view,  it is not at all  certain  that residential propinquity will  pro-
duce  the  intended cultural  change.  In  Levittown,  working class 
families  living  alongside  middle  class  ones  went  their  own  way 
most of the time.  For mobile ones, heterogeneity is  obviously de-
sirable,  provided  middle  class  people are  willing  to  teach  them, 
but  nonmobile  ones  will  react  negatively  to  force  feedings  of 
middle class  culture.  Neighbors are  expected  to  treat each  other 
as  equals, and working class  residents have enough difficulty pay-
ing the  higher cost of living among middle class  people,  without 
being viewed as  culturally deprived.  When working class organi-
zations  used  middle class  Levittowners  for  technical  and admin-

Social  Life:  Homogeneity  and  Conformity 

•  171  • 

istrative services,  they  rejected  those  who looked  down  on  them 
and constantly  tested  the  others  to  make  sure they  measured up 
to  the  norms  of  working class  culture.  For  example,  at  a  VF\V 
softball  game,  two  middle  class  members  were  razzed  unmerci-
fully  for  their  lack  of  athletic  skill.  Children  are  not  yet  fully 
aware of class,  so  that they can be with  (and learn from)  peers of 
other  classes,  and  there  is  some  evidence  that  in  schools  with  a 
majority  of  middle  class  children,  working  class  children  will 
adopt  the  formers'  standards  of  school  performance,  and  vice 
versa. 83 

By  its  very nature, demographic  homogeneity is  said  to  be  in-
compatible with  democracy,  and advocates  of diversity  have  em-
phasized  that a  democracy requires a  heterogeneous community. 
However,  as  the  description  of  Levittown's  school  and  political 
conflict should  indicate,  bringing people  with different  interests 
together  does  not automatically  result  in  the  use  of  democratic 
procedures.  Instead,  it  causes  conflict,  difficulties  in  decision-
making, and attempts to sidestep democratic norms.  If one group 
is  threatened  by  another's  demands,  intolerance  may  even  in-
crease.  Indeed,  democratic  procedure  is  often  so  fragile  that  it 
falls by the wayside under such stress, causing hysteria on the part 
of residents and the sort of panic on the part of the officials that I 
described. The fact is  that the democratic process probably works 
more smoothly in a homogeneous population. Absence of conflict 
is  of course  a  spurious  goal,  particularly  in  a  pluralistic  society, 
and  cannot  be  used  as  an  argument  for  homogeneity.  On  the 
other hand,  unless  conflict  becomes an end in itself,  heterogene-
ity is not a viable argument for greater democracy. 

CFiticsof thes11b11rbs  also  inveigh against  physical  homogene-
ity aDd  mass-produced  housing.  Like much of the rest of the cri-
tique;  this charge is. a  thinly veiled attack on the culture of work-
ing and  lower  middle class  people,  implying  that mass-produced 
h;)usi~g leads  to  mass-produced  lives.  The critics  seem  to  forget 
that the town houses of the upper class in the nineteenth century 
were  also  physically  homogeneous;  that everyone,  poor and  rich 
alike,  drives  mass-produced,  homogeneous  cars  without damage 
to  their  personalities;  and  that  today,  only  the  rich  can  afford 
custom-built  housing.  I  heard  no  objection  among  the  Levit-
towners  about  the  similarity  of  their  homes,  nor  the  popular 
jokes  about  being  unable  to  locate  one's  own  house. 34  Esthetic 
diversity  is  preferred,  however,  and people  talked about moving 

•  172  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

to  a  custom-built  house  in  the  future when  they  could afford  it. 
Meanwhile,  they made  internal  and external  alterations in their 
Levitt house to reduce sameness and to place a  personal stamp on 
their  property.n 

Block Homogeneity and Community Heterogeneity 

Putting together all  the arguments  for  and against  homogene-
ity suggests  that the optimum solution, at least in communities of 
homeowners  who  are  raising  small  children,  is  selective  homo-
geneity  at  the  block  level  and  heterogeneity  at  the  community 
level.  Whereas  a  mixture  of  population  types,  and  especially  of 
rich and poor,  is  desirable  in the community as  a  whole,  hetero-
geneity  on  the  block  will  not  produce  the  intended  tolerance, 
but  will  lead  to  conflict  that  is  undesirable  because  it  is  essen-
tially insoluble and thus becomes chronic. Selective homogeneity 
on  the  block  will  improve  the  tenor  of  neighbor  relations,  and 
will  thus  make  it  easier-although  not  easy-to  realize  hetero-
geneity at the community level. 

By "block" I  mean  here an area in which  frequent  face-to-face 
relations  take  place,  in  most  cases  a  sub-block  of  perhaps  ten  to 
twelve  houses.  Selective  homogeneity requires  enough  consensus 
among  neighbors  to  prevent  insoluble  conflict,  to  encourage 
positive although  not necessarily  intensive relationships between 
them, and  to make visiting  possible  for  those  who want it in  the 
immediate vicinity.  If Levittown  is  at all  typical,  the crucial  fac-
tors  in  homogeneity  are  age  and  class.  The  range  of  ages  and 
classes  that can  live  together is  not so  limited,  however,  as  to re-
quire tenant selection  programs.  The voluntary selection  pattern 
that  now  occurs  on  the  basis  of  house  price  is  more  than  suffi-
cient, and as  the ghettoization of the poor in public housing sug-
gests,  formal  and  involuntary  selection  has  many  serious  disad-
vantages.  Besides,  it  is  questionable  whether  planners  have  the 
knowledge  to  go  about  planning other  people's  social  relations, 
and even  if they had the knowledge,  it is doubtful  that they have 
the  right  to  do  so. 38  Of course,  selection  through  house  price  is 
also a  form of planning, but since it is  not directly related to ten-
ants' specific characteristics, it leaves  more room for choice. 

The emphasis on  voluntary  selection  also  copes  with  another 
objection  to  homogeneity,  that  it crystallizes  class  divisions  and 
makes people more aware of class differences.  Implicit in this ob-
jection  is  the  assumption  that  awareness  of  class  differences  is 

Social  Life:  Homogeneity  and  Conformity 

•  173  • 

wrong, and that any attempt to use class as a separating criterion is 
undesirable. This assumption would be defensible if it were part 
of a  larger program  to  eliminate  or at  least reduce  economic  in-
equities,  but it is  generally put forth  by  people  who  are  uncom-
fortable about the existence of classes and want to solve the prob-
lem by avoiding it. 

These  observations  have  a  number  of  implications  for  site 
planning.  Given  the  boundaries within which neighboring takes 
place,  the  significant  social  unit  in  the  community  (at  least,  in 
one  like  Levittown)  is  the  sub-block-which  is  not  a  physical 
unit.  Conversely,  the  neighborhood  of several  hundred  families 
which city planners have traditionally advocated is socially irrele-
vant,  whatever virtues  it may  have  in defining a  catchment area 
for  the  elementary school  or the neighborhood  shopping center. 
In fact,  in order  to maximize community heterogeneity,  it might 
be desirable  to  eliminate  the neighborhood  unit and  plan  for  a 
heterogeneous  array  of  homogeneous  blocks,  each  block  separ-
ated from  the next by enough of a real  or symbolic barrier tore-
assure  those concerned with property values.  This would encour-
age  more  heterogeneity  in  the  elementary  school  and  other 
neighborhood  facilities,  and  would  thus  contribute significantly 
to community heterogeneity.81 

Communities  should  be  heterogeneous  because  they  must  re-
flect  the pluralism of American society. Moreover, as  long as local 
taxation  is  the  main  source  of  funds  for  community  services, 
community  homogeneity  encourages  undesirable  inequalities. 
The  high-income  community  can  build  modern  schools  and 
other  high-quality  facilities;  the  low-income  community,  which 
needs these  facilities  more urgently, lacks  the tax base  to support 
them.  As  a  result,  poor  communities  elect  local  governments 
which  neglect  public  services  and  restrict  the  democratic  pro-
cess  in  the  need  to  keep  taxes  minimal.  Both  financial  inequity 
and its political consequences are eliminated  more  effectively  by 
federal  and state  subsidy  than by community  heterogeneity,  but 
so  long  as  municipal  services  are  financed  locally,  communities 
must include all income groups. 

The criteria on which  the advocacy  of block  homogeneity and 
community  heterogeneity  is  based  cannot  justify  racial  homo-
geneity at either level.  Experience with residential  integration  in 
many communities, including Levittown, indicates that it can  be 
achieved  without  problems  when  the  two  races  are  similar  in 

•

socioeconomic level  and  in  the visible cultural  aspects  of class-
provided,  however,  the  whites  are  not  beset  by  status  fears.  In-
deed,  the  major barrier  to  effective  integration  is  fear  of status 
deprivation,  especially  among  white  working class  homeowners. 
The whites  base  their fears  on the stereotype  that nonwhite peo-
ple  are  lower  class,  and  make  a  hasty  exodus  that  reduces  not 
property values but the selling prices that can be obtained by the 
departing  whites.  When  class  differences  between  the  races  are 
great,  the  exodus  is  probably  unavoidable,  but  where  Negroes 
and whites have been of equal status, it can be prevented, at least 
in  middle  class  areas.  Yet  even  if  this  were  not  the  case,  homo-
geneity is only one value among many, and if any person chooses 
to move among  people who differ  in race--or age,  income,  reli-
gion, or any other background characteristic-he has the right to 
do so  and  the right  to governmental  support in his  behalf.  That 
such  a  move  might  wreak  havoc  with  a  block's social  life  or the 
community's consensus  is  of lower priority than  the maintenance 
of such values as  freedom  of choice and equality. The advantages 
of residential  homogeneity  are  not  important  enough  to  justify 
depriving  anyone  of  access  to  housing  and  to  educational  and 
other opportunities. 

CONFORMITY  AND  COMPETITION 

I The suburban critique is  especially strident on the prevalence of 

conformity.  It argues  that  relationships  between  neighbors  and 
friends  are regulated by  the desire  to copy each other to achieve 
uniformity. At the same  time,  the critics also see suburbanites as 
competitive, trying to keep up or down with the Joneses to satisfy 
the  desire  for  status.  Conforming  (or  copying)  and  competing 
are  not  the  same-indeed,  they are  contradictory-but  they  are 
lumped  together  in  the  critique  because  they  are  based  on  the 
common  assumption that,  in the  suburbs,  behavior  and opinion 
are  determined  by  what  the  neighbors  do and  think,  and  indi-
vidualism is  found only in the city.  Both  competition and copy-
ing exist  in  Levittown,  but not for  the  reasons  suggested  by  the 
critics. They are ways of coping with heterogeneity and of retain-
ing  individuality  while  being  part  of  the  group.  They  exist  in 
every  group,  but  are  more  prevalent  among  homeowners  and, 
because of the fascination  with suburbia, more visible  there.  But 
this does not make them suburban phenomena. 

Social  Life:  Homogeneity  and  Conformity 

•  175  • 

Enough  of  the  suburban critique  has  seeped  into  the reading 
matter of Levittowners to make  "conformity" a  pejorative  term, 
and  interview questions about  it  would  have  produced  only de-
nials. Competition is  talked about in Levittown, however,  and 6o 
per cent of the random sample reported competition among their 
neighbors. 88  The  examples  they  gave,  however,  not  only  in-
cluded copying,  but half the respondents described  it positively. 
"I  don't  know  what  competition  is,"  said  one  man.  "Perhaps 
when we see the neighbors repairing the house, and we figure our 
own repairs would  be  a  good  idea."  Another put it more  enthu-
siastically:  "Friends and neighbors ask me what I've done, and by 
our visiting different  neighbors we  get  different  ideas  about fix-
ing up the house-how we  are going to  paint.  Instead of both of 
us buying an extension ladder, we go half and half." 

In  effect,  diverging  or  deviant  behavior  can  be  seen  as  com-
petition, conformity, or the chance to learn new ideas, depending 
on  the  observer.  One  who  dislikes  behavior  common  to  several 
neighbors may accuse  them of copying each other. 1£  the behavior 
is dissimilar, it must be a result of competition:  "keeping up with 
the  Joneses"  or  "spending  beyond  one's  means."  ·when the  be-
havior  is  approved,  however,  it  is  interpreted  as  sharing  ideas. 
The  observer's  perspective  is  shaped  principally  by  his  relative 
class position, or by his estimate of his  position. If the observer is 
of higher status  than  the  observed,  he  will  interpret  the  latter's 
attempt to share higher-status ideas as competing, and his sharing 
of lower status ways  as  copying. If the observer is  of lower status 
than  the observed,  his ideas will  not be shared,  of course,  but he 
will  consider  the  more  affluent  life  style  of  the  higher-status 
neighbor as  motivated by status-striving or "keeping up with  the 
Joneses." 39  As  one blue collar man  put it,  "There are some who 
act  so  darned  important,  as  if  they  have  so  much,  and  I  can't 
figure  out what  they  are  doing  in  Levittown  when  they  have  so 
much."  Another blue  collar  man  who had  taught  his  neighbors 
about  lawn  care,  and  felt  himself  to  be  their  equal,  was  not 
threatened:  "One  or  two  try  to  keep  up  with  the  Joneses,  but 
generally  people are  not worried.  If one gets ahead and  another 
copies him, we  laugh. Our attitude is,  all the more power to him. 
Wher.  we  can  afford  it,  we  make  improvements  too."  In  other 
words,  when  the  observer  feels  he  is  equal  to  the  observed,  he 
will  see  competing  and  copying  either as  sharing  or as  friendly 
games.  And  socially  mobile  people  tend  to  judge  the  ways  of 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

higher-status  people  positively,  for  they can  look  to  their  neigh-
bors  for  guidance  about  how  to  live  in  the  suburbs.  "Everyone 
has  fixed  up  their  houses,  but  not  to  compete,"  a  former  city 
dweller  reported.  "At  first  none  of  us  had  anything  and  maybe 
you saw what others did and you copied it." Needless to say,  those 
who are  being copied  may consider  the  mobile neighbor a  com-
peting upstart. 

Status-striving  is  generally  ascribed  to  people  with  more 
money,  more  education,  and  a  different  life  style  by  those  who 
cannot afford the style or prefer a different one. The same motive 
is  inferred about social  relations.  Cliques  of higher-status  people 
are seen by lower-status observers as  groups that coalesce for pres-
tige  reasons,  and  lower-status cliques are viewed  by  higher-status 
observers  as  groups  that  come  together  to  conform.  When  rela-
tions  among neighbors of unequal  status deteriorate,  the  higher-
status  person  explains  it  in  terms  of  culturally or morally  unde-
sirable actions  by  the lower-status neighbor;  the lower-status  per-
son  ascribes  the  break  to  his  neighbor's  desire  to  be  with  more 
prestigious  people.  In  reality,  instances  of  overt  status-striving, 
carried  out  to  show  up the  lower  status  of  neighbors,  are  rare. 
"Keeping up"  takes  place,  but  mainly  out  of  the  need  to  main-
tain  self-respect,  to  "put the  best face  forward"  or not to be con-
sidered  inferior and  "fall  behind."  Serious  status-striving  is  usu-
ally a  desperate attempt by a  socially  isolated neighbor to salvage 
self-respect through material or symbolic displays of status, and is 
dismissed or scorned.  One such neighbor was described as  "trying 
to  be  the  Joneses,  and  hoping  people  will  follow  him,  but  we 
don't pay any attention to him." Indeed, the social  control norms 
of  block  life  encourage  "keeping  down  with  the  Joneses,"  and 
criticize  display  of  unusual  affluence,  so  that  people  who  can 
afford  a  higher  standard  of living than  the rest  and  who show  it 
publically are unpopular and are sometimes ostracized.40 

Conforming and copying occur more frequently  than competi-
tion,  mostly  to  secure  the proper appearance of  the  block  to im-
press  strangers.  A  pervasive  system  of social  control  develops  to 
enforce standards of appearance on the block, mainly concerning 
lawn  care.41  Copying  and  some  competition  take  place  in  this 
process,  but  neither  the  Levittowners  nor  the  suburban  critics 
would describe it in these terms.  Everyone knows  it is  social  con-
trol  and  accepts  the  need  for  it,  although  one  year  some  of my 
neighbors and I wished we could pave our front lawns with green

concrete  to  eliminate  the  endless  watering  and  mowing  and  to 
forestall criticism of poor lawns. 

The primary technique for social control is  humor. Wisecracks 
are  made  to  show  up deviant  behavior,  and  overt  criticism  sur-
faces  only when  the  message  behind  the  wisecracks  does  not get 
across.  Humor  is  used  to  keep  relations  friendly  and  because 
people feel  that demands for  conformity are  not entirely proper; 
they  realize  that  such  demands  sometimes  require  a  difficult 
compromise  between  individual  and  group  standards.  When  it 
comes  to  lawn  care,  however,  most  people  either  have  no  hard-
and-fast personal standards, or they value friendly relations more. 
Since the block norms and the compromises they require are usu-
ally worked out soon after the block is  occupied-when everyone 
is striving to prove he will be a good neighbor-they are taken for 
granted by the time the block has settled down. 

The demand for compromise is  also reduced by limiting block 
standards to the exterior appearance of the front of the house and 
the  front  yard,  the  back  being less  visible  to  outsiders.  Interiors, 
which  involve  the  owner's  ego  more,  are  not  subjected  to  criti-
cism.  People are  praised  for  a  nice-looking  home,  but  there are 
no wisecracks  about deviant taste in furnishings-at  least,  not  to 
the  owner.  The  same  limitation  holds  for  cars  and  other  con-
sumer goods  purchased.  Although  I  drove  a  1952  Chevrolet,  by 
far  the oldest car on the block,  no one ever joked with me about 
it, 42  but Levittowners who  used  trucks  in  their work and  parked 
them  on  their  streets  at  night,  giving  the  block  the  image  of  a 
working class  district,  were criticized  by  middle  class  neighbors. 
The criticism was  made  behind  their  backs,  however,  because  it 
affected  the  neighbors'  source  of  livelihood.  In  this  case,  as  in 
some others, social  control was  passed on to the township govern-
ment,  and  eventually,  it  voted  an  ordinance  prohibiting  truck-
parking on residential streets. 

What  people  do  inside  their  houses  is  considered  their  own 
affair,  but  loud  parties,  drunkenness,  and  any  other  noticeable 
activities  that  would  give  the  block  a  bad  reputation  are  criti-
cized.  So  are' parents who let their children run loose  at all  hours 
of  the  evening,  not  only  because  they  publicly violate  norms  of 
good parenthood, but also because they make it harder for neigh-
bors  to  put  their own children  to  bed.  Private  deviant behavior 
is,  of course, gossiped about with gusto, but only when it becomes 
visible, and repeatedly so,  is  gossip translated into overt criticism. 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

Even visible deviance  that affects block appearance is  tolerated if 
it is  minor and if the individual  believes firmly  in what he is  do-
ing.  One  Levittowner  decided  that  he  would  buy  a  wooden 
screen  door,  rather  than  the  popular but more  expensive alumi-
num one.  He decided, however, to maintain  block uniformity by 
painting it with aluminum color.  "People will  think I'm cheap," 
he  told me, "but I  don't mind that. I  know  I'm thrifty." I  do not 
know what people thought, but he was  not criticized. 

Copying also  takes  place  without  being  impelled  by conform-
ity, and then becomes a group phenomenon that occurs in spurts. 
When  one  neighbor  builds a  patio or repaints  his  house,  others 
are likely to follow his  lead, but not automatically. On my block, 
for  instance, one homeowner repainted  his  house  in  1959  but no 
one  imitated  him.  When  another  began  to  do  it  the  next  year, 
however,  a rash of repainting occurred. If this had been simply a 
copying  phenomenon,  the  painting should  have  started  in  1959, 
especially since the first  painter was a  popular community leader. 
What happened  in  1g6o  is  easi1y  explained.  By  that time,  houses 
built in  1958  needed repainting, and when one man, who had an 
early  vacation,  devoted  his  two  weeks  to  it,  other  men  followed 
his  example when they went on vacation. 43 

People  also  buy  household  items  and plants  they  have  seen  at 
their neighbors',  but only when  the item is  either widely desired 
or  clearly  useful.  For  example,  early  in  Levittown's  history,  a 
rumor  spread  that  the  willow  trees  the  builder  had  planted 
would  eventually  root  into  and  crack  the  sewer  pipes,  and  one 
man  promptly  took  out his  tree.  Neighbors who were  friends  of 
his followed suit, but others refused to accept the rumor and kept 
their  trees.  On  my  block,  the  rumor was  initiated  by  a  Catholic 
leader, and within a week,  the Catholics had  taken out their wil-
low  trees,  but the  others had  not followed  suit.  My own  innova-
tion, inexpensive bamboo shades to keep out the blazing sun, was 
not  copied;  people  said  they  looked  good,  but  no  one  imitated 
me. 

COMPETITION, CONFORMITY,  AND  HETEROGENEITY 

Both competition and conformity are ways  of coping with  heter-
ogeneity,  principally  of  class.  \Vhen  lower-status  people  are  ac-
cused  of  copying  and  higher-status  ones  of  living  beyond  their 
means  to  impress  the  neighbors,  disapproval  is  put  in  terms  of 

Social  Life:  Homogeneity  and  Conformity 

•  179  • 

negative motives  rather  than  class  differences,  for  accusations  of 
deviant behavior which  blame individuals make it more difficult 
for  the  deviant  to  appeal  to  his  group  norms.  Such  accusations 
also  enable  people  to  ignore  the  existence  of  class  differences. 
Class  is  a  taboo subject, and the taboo is  so  pervasive,  and so  un-
conscious, that people rarely think in class terms. 

Competition and conformity exist  also  because  people are de-
pendent on  their neighbors.  In working class  or ethnic enclaves, 
where social life is concentrated among relatives, their criticism is 
feared more than the neighbors'.  Upper middle class people, hav-
ing  less  to  do  with  neighbors,  conform  most  closely  to  the  de-
mands of their friends.  In Levittown, neighbors are an important 
reference  group,  not only  for  lower  middle  class  people  but for 
working class ones cui off from relatives.  Even so,  the prime cause 
of  both competition and conformity is  home  ownership and  the 
mutual need to  preserve property and status values.  Only  11  per 
cent of former renters but 70  per cent of former  homeowners re-
ported  noticing competition  in  their former  residence,  but both 
observed  it equally  in  Levittown.  Moreover,  whether  they came 
from  urban or suburban neighborhoods,  they reported  no  more 
competition  in  Levittown  than  in  the  former  residence.  Conse-
quently, competition  is  not distinctive  either  to Levittown  or to 
the suburbs. 

What,  then,  accounts  for  the  critics'  preoccupation  with  sub-
urban conformity, and their tendency to see status competition as 
a dominant theme in suburban life? For one thing, many of these 
critics live in city apartments, where  the concern for  block status 
preservation is minimal. Also,  they are largely upper middle class 
professionals,  dedicated  to  cosmopolitan  values  and  urban  life 
and disdainful  of the local  and antiurban values of lower middle 
class  and  working  class  people.  Believing  in  the  universality  of 
these  values,  the  critics  refuse  to  acknowledge  the  existence  of 
lower middle  class  or working class  ways  of living.  Instead,  they 
describe people as  mindless conformers who would be cosmopoli-
tans  if  they were  not weak and allowed  themselves  to  be swayed 
by builders, the mass  media, and  their neighbors. 

The ascription  of  competitive  behavior  to  the  suburbs  stems 
from another source. The upper middle class world, stressing as  it 
does individuality, is  a  highly competitive one. In typically upper 
middle class  occupations  such  as  advertising,  publishing,  univer-
sity  teaching,  Jaw,  and  the  arts,  individual  achievement  is  the 

•  180  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

main key  to  success,  status,  and security. The upper middle class 
is  for  this  reason  more  competitive  and  more  status-conscious 
than  the  other  classes.  Popular  writers  studying  upper  middle 
class  suburbs have observed  this competition and some  have mis-
takenly ascribed it to suburbia, rather than to the criteria for suc-
cess  in  the  professions  held  by  these  particular  suburbanites.44 
Those  writing  about  lower-status  suburbs  have  either  drawn 
their  information  from  upper  middle  class  friends  who  have 
moved  to  lower  middle  class  suburbs  for  financial  reasons  and 
found  themselves a dissatisfied minority, or they have, like upper 
middle  class  people  generally,  viewed  the  lower-status  people 
about  whom  they  were  writing  as  trying  to  compete  with  their 
betters. 

Finally,  the new suburbs,  being more visible  than other lower 
middle  and  working  class  residential  areas,  have  become  news-
worthy, and during the 1950s they replaced "mass culture" as  the 
s_c~pegoat and  most  convenient  target  fpr  the  fear  and  distaste 
that upper middle class people feel  for  the rest of the population. 
Affluent  suburbs have  bec-ome false  targets of dissatisfaction with 
the  upper  middle  class's  own  status-consciousness  and  competi-
tion,  the  "rat-race"  i~  experiences  in  career  and  social  striving 
having been projected on life beyond the city limits. 

The inaccuracy of the critique does not, of course,  exclude the 
possibility  that  conforming  and  competing  are  undesirable  or 
dangerous,  or  that  too  much  of  both  take  place  in  Levittown.  I 
do not believe either to be the case.  If one distinguishes between 
wanted  conformity,  as  when  neighbors  learn  from  each  other or 
s_h<!_re  ideas;  tolerated  conformity,  when  they  adjust  their  own 
standards  in  order  to  maintain friendly  relations;  and unwanted 
conformity,  when  they  bow  to  pressure  and  give  up  their  indi-
viduality, only the last is clearly undesirable, and in Levittown it 
is  rare.  Tolerated  conformity requires  some  surrender  of auton-
omy,  but I can see why  Levittowners feel  it  is  more important to 
be friendly  with one's neighbors  than to insist  on individual but 
unpopular  ways  of  fixing  up  the  outside  of  the  house.  The 
amount of copying and conformity  is  hardly  excessive,  consider-
ing  the  heterogeneity  on  the  block.  Indeed,  given  the  random 
way  in which  Levittowners become neighbors,  it  is  amazing  that 
neighbor  relations  were  so  friendly  and  tolerant  of  individual 
differences.  Of course,  the working class  and  upper middle  class 
minorities experience pressure for unwanted conformity, but the

latter can get  away  from  the  block for  social  activities,  and  ulti-
mately, only some of the former suffer.  Ironically,  their exposure 
to  pressures  for  conformity  is  a  result  of  the  heterogeneity  that 
the critics want to increase even further.

11.  Thirty-one per cent said  more  than  two favorite  couples lived  on 
their street, and the remaining 38 per cent, less  than two. As  might 
be  expected,  college-educated  respondents  chose  even  fewer 
friends from  their own street.  Using street addresses actually over-
stated  the  role  of  propinquity,  for  not  all  people  on  the  same 
street--especially if it was  a  long one-are neighbors,  and several 
first  met such  couples in church or in  a  club.  A  study of an  Irish 
new town reported 31  per cent of the best friends,~ere neighbors,

13.  This relationship varies with age,  of course, and older children do 
not  choose  propinquitous  playmates  as  often.  Olsen's  study  of 
children's  birthday  parties  reported  in  the  Levittown  newspaper 
showed  that  among  three-year-olds,  guests  came  from  a  median 
distance  of  364  feet;  775  feet  among  four-year-olds,  1130  feet 
among  seven-year-olds.  The  distance  then  remained  fairly  stable 
until  it rose  to  about  2000  feet  among  twelve- and  thirteen-year-
olds. 

14.  A  study  of  newcomers  in  an  old  suburb  suggests  that  teenagers 
may  even  react  to  class  conflict  that  is  limited  to  parents.  "If a 
family  is  scapegoated,  the  youngsters  will  soon  turn  up  in  some 
mischief or as  delinquents."  Thoma and Lindemann,  p.  193. 
15.  Class conflicts  among neighbors in  Levittown,  New  York,  are  de-
scribed by Dobriner (1963),  pp.  107-108;  in English  new  towns  by 
Young  and  Willmott,  Chap.  10,  and  by  Willmott  (1963).  p.  114. 
16.  The social  isolation of suburban working class women and better-
educated ones  with  distinctive  tastes  is  also  reported  by  Gutman, 
pp.  174,  181-182. See  also  Haeberle,  Chap.  7· 

17.  Although only 20  per cent of the random sample reported cliques 

on  their blocks,  all were Jewish ones, with one exception. 

18.  Jews  often  move  into  communities  where  the  median  income  is 
lower than th1eir own, partly because some prefer to spend a lower 
share  of  their  income on  housing,  partly  because  they  fear  rejec-
tion from non-Jewish neighbors of similar income and education. 
19.  The  sexual  overtones  did  not  affect  my  interviewing,  because 
strangers were exempt. Women are permitted to have latent sexual 
interest  in  casual  encounters-giving  rise  to  jokes  about  the  ice-
man and the milkman-and only neighbors'  husbands are  taboo. 

Social  Life:  Homogeneity  and  Conformity 

20.  People  were  asked  about  "the  visiting  you  and  your  husband 
(wife)  do with other couples, either among neighbors or anywhere 
else  in  Levittown. 

21.  Forty-four  per cent  of  the 1·andom sample  reported  more  couple 
visiting;  21  per cent,  less;  and 35  per cent,  no change.  Among the 
Philadelphians,  the percentages were almost the same:  39· 22,  and 
39,  respectively.  In  a  new  working class  suburb,  38  per  cent  said 
"they entertain friends. at home"  more  often  than  before,  but  27 
per cent  reported  less.  See  Berger  (196o),  p.  65. 

22.  Fifty per cent of  organizational members and  27  per cent of non-
members reported more couple visiting. So  did 83  per cent of the 
Jews in the random sample,  and 53  per cent in the city sample, as 
compared  to  go  per cent and  17  per cent of  the Protestants.  The 
association  between  visiting  and  organizational  activity  was  also 
found in Levittown,  Pennsylvania by Jahoda et al.,  p.  107. 

23.  Among  Philadelphians  of  mixed  marriage,  only  20  per  cent  re-
ported  an  increase,  and  6o  per  cent  a  decrease  in  couple  visiting 
after leaving the city. Sixteen per cent in both samples were inter-
marriages,  usually  of Catholics with  Protestants. 

24.  Sec,  e.g.,  Whyte  (1956),  <:;hap.  21. 
25.  Low-status respondents have as  many friends as  middle- and high-
status  ones,  but  the  former  do  less  couple  visiting  than  in  the 
previous residence. 

26.  The neighbors  I  knew  best  in  the West  End of Boston  had open 
house  every  Tuesday  night,  visited  the  open  house  of  relatives 
every Friday night, and visited with yet other relatives and friends 
on Sundays.

31.  Forty-four per cent  said  they had done  "much" visiting with  eth-
nic or religious peers in Philadelphia, and 52  per cent, "some." In 
Levittown,  the  percentages  shifted  slightly,  to  37  and  66,  respec-
tively.  Respondents  were  free  to  define  what  they  considered 
"much" or "some." Jews and low-status people reported  the  most 
ethnic-religious visiting;  Irish Catholics,  the greatest increase after 
moving  to  Levittown. 

32.  See,  e.g.,  Williams,  pp.  437-447· 
33·  See,  e.g.,  Wilson,,but  also  the study  by  Sewell  and  Armer  which 
questioned the impact of "neighborhood context" on educational 
aspirations.  Of course,  in school  students are  a  captive  audience, 
and  school  contacts  among  working  and  middle  class  students 
may  evaporate  after  school  hours. 

M·  A  study  of a  Scottish  new  town  reported  that  "only  one-fifth  of 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

the tenants said  they would prefer more variety and intermixture 
of house-types, while two-fifths regarded the row of identical build-
ings  as  a  desirable  feature,"  and  that  "a  house  which  is  one  of 
many in a  street can become personalized without much aid from 
the architect." See  Hole,  p.  169. 

35·  It  is  illuminating  to  compare  the  early  popular  writing  about 
Levittown,  New York,  to  more  recent  reports.  Initially,  the  Long 
Island community was  widely described (and decried)  as a hideous 
example  of  mass-produced  housing  which  would  soon  turn  into 
a  slum;  twenty  years  later,  journalists  report  the  diversity  pro-
duced  by  the  alteration  of houses,  and  the  charm created  by  the 
maturing of trees and shrubbery-and, of course,  the demand for 
the houses,  which now sell for about twice  their original price.

37·  A  similar  solution  has  been  proposed  in  England  by  Willmott 

(1963),  pp. 117-u8. See also Dean (1958). 

38.  People were  asked,  "What kind of competition have  you  noticed 
between the neighbors about such  things as  getting things for  the 
house, fixing up the yard, or repainting the house?" 

39·  Forty-four per cent of the blue collar respondents reported "keep-
ing up with the Joneses"  among their neighbors,  but only  31  per 
cent of the white collar and professional ones did so.  In an English 
working  class  new  town,  26  per  cent  made  similar  complaints, 
principally lower-income people about those with higher incomes.

42.  In fact,  I was more often praised for having taken good care of the 
car,  for my  thrift, and for  my  good luck in possessing a  better car 
than the more recent models. 

43·  Copying took place only when someone decided to paint his house 
another color. Since this violated a deed-restriction, people waited 
for  someone  to  break  the  rules  and  then  followed  suit quickly-
but they did not copy the initiator's color scheme.

THE  VITALITY  OF 

COMMUNITY  CULTURE 

D 

D 

LEADING  WITH  THEIR  ASSUMPTION  OF  HOMOGENEITY  AND  CONFORM-
ity,  many critics see  the culture of communities like  Levittown-
those  features  transcending  social  life-as  marked  by  sameness, 
dullness, and blandness. The image of sameness derives from  the 
mass-produced housing,  and also from  the  prevalence of a nation-
al and equally mass-produced culture of consumer goods ~hich is 
extended  to  characterize  the  consumers  themselves.  Part  of  the 
critique  is  tinged  with  political  fear  that  the  national  culture 
and  the  deleterious  effects  of  conformity  may  sap  the  strength 
of local  organizations,  which  will  in  turn  break  down  the  com-
munity social  structures that  act as  barriers between  the  individ-
ual and  the state.  According  to  theorists  of the  mass  society,  the 
individual  then becomes submissive and subject to demagoguery 
that  can  incite  mass  hysteria  and  mob  action,  destroying  the 
checks  and balances  of a  democratic  society.  This hypothesis,  de-
veloped  originally  by  Ortega  y  Gasset,  the  Spanish  conservative 
philosopher  who  feared  popular  democracy,  gained  prominence 
during  the  1930s  when  Hitler  and  Stalin  systematically  elimi-
nated  local  organizations  to  forestall  opposition  to  their  plans. 
In America, this analysis has flowered  with  the increasing central-
ization  of  the  federal  government,  but  suburbia  is  considered 
particularly susceptible to  the dangers of mass  society because of 
the  rootlessness  and  absence  of  community  strength  supposedly 
induced  by  the  large  number  of  Transients.1  Other  observers, 

•  zBs  • 

•  186  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

less fearful  of mass society, stress and blandness of suburban life, 
which,  they  fear,  is  producing  dull  and  apathetic  individuals.2 
T~ese charges  are  serious and,  if accurate,  would  suggest  that 
suburbia is  a danger to American democracy and culture. Most of 
them,  however,  are  either  inaccurate  or, when  accurate,  without 
\\the  negative consequences attributed  to  them.  Levittown  is  very 
much  a  local  community;  if  anything,  it  neglects  its  ties  to  the 
I larger society more than it should.  It is  not rootless,  even with its 
1,Transients, and  it  is  not dull, except to its teenagers.  The critics' 
'conclusions stem in part from  the previously mentioned class and 
cultural  differences  between  them  and  the  suburbanites.  What 
they see as  blandness and apathy is  really a  result of the invisibil-
ity  and  home-centeredness  of  lower  middle  class  culture,  and 
what they consider dullness derives  from  their cosmopolitan stan-
dard for judging communities, which condemns  those  lacking ur-
ban  facilities--ranging  from  museums  to  ethnic  districts--that 
are favored by the upper mi~dle class. 

They  also  look  at  suburbia  as  outsiders,  who  approach  the 
community with a  "tourist" perspective. The tourist wants visual 
interest, cultural diversity,  entertainment, esthetic  pleasure, vari-
ety  (preferably  exotic),  and  emotional  stimulation.  The  resi-
dent,  on  the  other  hand,  wants  a  comfortable,  convenient,  and 
socially satisfying  place  to  live-esthetically pleasing,  to  be sure, 
but first and foremost functional  for his daily needs.  Much of the 
critique of suburbia as community reflects  the critics' disappoint· 
ment that  the new suburbs do not satisfy  their particular tourist 
requirements;  that  they are  not  places  for  wandering,  that  they 
lack  the  charm  of  a  medieval  village,  the  excitement  of  a  me· 
tropolis,  or the architectural  variety of an  upper-income  suburb. 
Even  so,  tourism  cuts  across  all  classes.  A  neighbor,  returning 
from  a  trip  to  Niagara  Falls,  complained  bitterly  about  com-
mercialization,  using  much  the  same  language  as  the  critics  do 
about  suburbia.  What  he  felt  about  the  Falls,  however,  he  did 
not  feel  about  Levittown. 

We are  all  tourists  at  one  time  or another,  but most  commu-
nities  can  serve  both  tourist  and  residential  functions  only with 
difficulty.  For  example,  rhe  crowding  and  nightlife  that  attract 
the  tourist  to  Greenwich  Village  make  it uncomfortable  for  the 
resident.  Although the tourist perspective is  understandable, and 
even  justifiable,  it  is  not  by  itself  a  proper criterion for  evaluat-
ing a  community,  especially  a  purely residential  one  like  Levit-

The  Vitality  of  Community  Culture 

town.  It must  be judged  first  by  the  quality  of  community  life 
and culture it offers  its residents;  the needs of the tourist are sec-
ondary. 

mE NATIONAL  CULTURE  AND  mE COMMUNITY 

To  the outside observer,  Levittown  appears  to  be  a  community 
on  which  the  national  American  culture  has  been  imprinted  so 
totally as  to leave  little room  for  local  individuality.  The houses 
express  the  current  national  residential  style:  pseudo-Colonial 
fronts  borrowed  from  the  eighteenth century glued on a  variety 
of  single-family  house  styles  developed  between  the  eighteenth 
and  twentieth  centuries,  and hiding twentieth century interiors. 
Schools are contemporary, modular, one-story buildings that look 
like all  other new schools.  The shopping center is  typical  too, al-
though the interior is  more tastefully designed  than most. It con-
sists mainly of branches of large national chains, whose  inventory 
is  dominated by prepackaged national  brands, and the small cen-
ters are  no different.  The old "Mom and  Pop" grocery  has  been 
replaced  by  the  "7  to  11"  chain,  which,  as  its  name  indicates, 
opens  early  and  closes  late,  but sells  only  prepackaged  goods  so 
that each store can be serviced by a single cashier-clerk.  Even the 
Jewish and Italian foods  sold  at the  "delis" are cut from  the loaf 
of a  "pan-ethnic" culture that is now nationally distributed. 

A  large,  partially preplanned residential development must al-
most inevitably depend on national organizations, since these are 
the  only  ones  that  can  afford  the  initial  capital  investment  and 
the unprofitable hiatus  before  the community is  large  enough to 
support  them  properly.  This  is  as  true  of stores  in a  new  shop-
ping  center-which  sometimes  wait  years  before  they  show  a 
profit-as it is  of churches and voluntary organizations.  In addi-
tion,  Levittown  itself  is  in  some  ways  a  national  brand,  for  the 
size  of  Levitt's  operation  in  an  industry  of  small  entrepreneurs 
has  made  his  communities  a  national  symbol  of  low-price  sub-
urbia. This has helped to attract national organizations, as  well as 
Transients  who  work  for  large  national  corporations.  When 
they  move  into  a  new  metropolitan  area,  they  usually  do  not 
know where to find  housing,  and having heard of Levittown, are 
likely  to  look  there  first.  The  brand  name  "Levittown"  makes 
the  housing  more  trustworthy  than  a  small  subdivision  con-
structed  by  an unknown  local  builder. 

•  188  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

Although  Levittown  would  thus  seem  to  be,  as  much  as  any 
community in America,  an  example of Big Culture,  this  is  only 
superficially  true,  for  the  quality  of  life  in  Levittown  retains  a 
strictly  local  and  often  antinational  flavor,  exploiting  national 
bodies and resources for strictly local  purposes whenever possible. 
To  the  visitor,  the  Levittown  houses  may  look  like  all  other 
pseudo-Colonial ones in South Jersey,  but Levittowners can cata-
log  the  features  that  distinguish  their  houses  from  those  in 
nearby  subdivisions.  The  stores  may  be  chains  selling  brand-
name  goods,  but  the  managers  become  involved  in  local  activ-
ities  and  enable  local  groups  to  hold  bazaars  and  other  fund-
raising  affairs,  including  bakesales  which  compete  with  store 
merchandise.  The same  patterns obtain in voluntary associations 
and churches.  For  example,  the  Boy  Scouts  are  run  by an  intri-
cate national  bureaucracy which sets  detailed rules for  the activ-
ities of local  troops.  Since the organization must attract children, 
however,  what actually goes  on at  troop  meetings  bears little re-
semblance to the rules, and the less  the national office  knows,  the 
better for  it and the troop leader. 

The  priority  of  local  concerns  is  even  more  emphatic  in  gov-
ernment,  for  federal  agencies  and  national  party  headquarters 
are  viewed  mainly  as  sources of funds  and  power  to  be used  for 
local  needs.  A  civil  defense  agency was  set  up  in  Levittown,  not 
to  satisfy  national  regulations,  but  because  the  county  civil  de-
fense  director was  running for  political  office.  The national  pro-
gram  provided  him  an  opportunity  to  distribute  some  funds  to 
local communities, which in turn enhanced his political fortunes. 
Federal  funds  which  came  to  Levittown  for  civil  defense  were 
used for local  police and fire  needs as  much as  possible within the 
limits  of  the  law.  Similarly,  when  the  Township  Committee  in 
1g6o  invited  both  Nixon  and  Kennedy  to  campaign  in  Levit-
town,  its  purpose  was  not  to  support  the  national  candidates of 
the two parties but to gain publicity for Levittown. 

Many  Levittowners  work  in  branch  offices  or  factories  of  na-
tional corporations, and their reports about their work and their 
employers  suggest  that  national  directives  are  often  viewed  as 
outlandish  and  unreasonable,  to  be  sabotaged  in  favor  of  local 
priorities.  However  much  a  national  corporation  may  give  the 
appearance of a well-run and thoroughly centralized monolith, in 
actual  fact  it  is  often a  shaky aggregate of local  baronies. The re-
sult  is  considerable  skepticism  among  Levittowners  about  the 

The  Vitality  of  Community  Culture 

•  189  • 

effectiveness  and  power  of  national  corporations,  a  skepticism 
easily extended to all national agencies. 

Generally speaking,  Levittowners do not take much interest in 
the  national  society,  and  rarely  even  see  its  influence  on  their 
lives. As long as they are employed, healthy, and able to achieve a 
reasonable  proportion of their personal  goals,  they have no  need 
for  the  federal  government  or  any  other  national  agency,  and 
being locals,  they do not concern themselves with  the world out-
side  their community. Indeed, they  might  better  be  described as 
sublocals,  for  they  are  home-oriented  rather  than  community· 
oriented. Although the lower middle class is sometimes said to re· 
ject bigness,  the  Levittowners do not share  this  feeling.  They do 
not scorn  big supermarkets and national  brands as do the critics, 
and although  they do not see  the  big society  very  clearly,  it ap· 
pears to them as  an  inept octopus  which  can  only cope  with  the 
community through force or bribery. It is opposed not because of 
its  size,  but  because  it is  an  outsider.  When  a  national  service 
club  organized  a  branch  in  Levittown,  one  of  the  Levittowners 
said,  "They are  big and  they  can  help  us,  but we  don't  have  to 
follow  national  policy . . . .  National  headquarters  is  only  a 
racket  that  takes  your  money."  The cultural  orientation  toward 
localism  is  supported  by  more  pressing  sociological  factors;  if a 
local  branch of a  national association  is  to succeed,  it must adapt 
itself to local  priorities in order to attract members, and national 
headquarters must be opposed if it refuses  to go along.  The most 
disliked  outsider  is  not  the  national  society,  however,  but  the 
cosmopolitan with  his  "Brookline values." 

All  this does not, of course,  imply that the national society and 
culture  are  powerless  in  Levittown.  When  industrial  giants  set 
administered  prices  for  consumer  goods  sold  in  the  local  shop-
ping center,  or when  Detroit  engineers  the  annual  style  change 
in its automobiles,  the individual  purchaser can  only express  his 
discontent by refusal  to buy, and when it comes to necessities,  he 
lacks  even  that  choice.  In  Levittown,  however,  the  discontent 
and  the  lack  of  choice  are  minimized,  for  most  people  have 
enough  money  to  pay  administered  prices  and  enough  freedom 
to  choose  among  products.  In  fact,  they  find  themselves  well 
served  by  the  corporations  who  sell  them  their  housing,  food, 
furnishings,  and  transportation.  However,  Levittowners  are  less 
concerned  with  "consumption"  than  the  critics.  They  care  less 
about the  things  they buy and are less  interested in  asserting in-

•  190  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNEBS 

dividuality through consumer behavior,  for  they do not use  con· 
sumption  to  express  class  values  as  much  as  the  upper  middle 
class does.  They may not like mass-produced bread as well  as  the 
local  bakery product they perhaps ate  in childhood,  but they do 
not make· an  issue  of  it,  and  do  not feel  themselves  to  be  mass 
men simply  because  they  buy a  mass-produced  item.  Goods  are 
just not important enough.  Only when  they become tourists are 
they "materialistic"-and traditional.  One of my neighbors who 
was  once  stationed  in Japan  was  not at all  concerned  about  the 
national  prepackaged  brands  sold  in  Levittown,  but  talked  fre-
quently about the commercialization of Japanese culture and the 
unattractive goods he found in the souvenir shops. 

The Mass  Media 

For Levittowners,  probably the most enduring-and c~rtainly 
the most frequent-tie to the national culture is through the mass 
media. Yet even  this is filtered  through a  variety of personal  pre-
dispositions  so  that not many messages  reach  the receiver  intact. 
Few  people  are  dominated  by  the  mass  media;  they  provide 
escape  from  boredom,  fill  up brief  intervals,  and  (perhaps  most 
important)  occupy  the  children  while  the  adults  go  about  their 
business. 

The  most  frequently  used  mass  medium  is  television,  with 
newspapers,  magazines,  and  paperback  novels  following  in  that 
order. In working class homes in Levittown as  elsewhere,  the TV 
set is  likely to be on all  the time, even when company comes,  for 
as  one  Levittowner explained,  "If conversation  lags,  people can 
watch  or it gives  you  something  to  talk  about."  This statement 
suggests  more  the  fears  that  working  class  people  have  about 
their  social  skills  than  their  practice,  for  conversation  does  not 
often lag, at least among friends. 

Middle  class  people,  surer of  their social  skills,  use  television 
more  selectively.  The  children  watch  when  they  have  come  in 
from  play;  after they are  put to bed the adults may  tum on the 
set,  for  television  fills  the  hours  between  g  P.M.  and  bedtime, 
when there is not enough of a block of time for other activities. A 
few  favorite  programs  may  get  rapt attention,  but I  doubt  that 
television supplanted conversation among either middle or work-
ing  class  Levittowners.  There  is  no  indication  that  television-
viewing  increased  after  people  moved  to  Levittown,  for  no one 
mentioned it when  interviewed  about  changes  in  spare-time  ac-

The  Vitality  of  Community  Culture 

•  191 

• 

tivities.  I  suspect  that  viewing had  actually decreased  somewhat, 
at least  during the  time of my study,  when gardening was  still a 
time-consuming novelty for many people. 

Television viewing is  also a  much less  passive activity  than the 
critics  of  the  mass  media  suspect.3  Routine  serials  and situation 
comedies  evoke  little  response,  although  Levittowners  are  sensi-
tive  to  anachronisms  in  the  plots  and  skeptical  of  advertising 
claims. 4  Dramatic  programs  may  provoke  spirited-and  quite 
personal-reactions. For example, one evening my neighbors and 
I  watched an hour-long drama which depicted the tragic career of 
an  introverted  girl  who  wanted desperately  to  become a  serious 
actress  but  was  forced  to  work  as  a  rock-and-roll  dancer,  and 
finally  decided  to  give  up  show  business.  One  neighbor  missed 
the tragedy altogether,  and  thought the girl  should  have  kept on 
trying  to  become  an  actress.  The other  neighbor  fastened  on-
and  approved  of-the ending  (in  which  the  actress  returned  to 
her husband and  to  the family  restaurant in which she  had been 
"discovered")  and  wondered,  rightly,  whether  it was  possible  to 
go back to a  mundane life after the glamor of the entertainment 
world. 

People  do  not  necessarily  know  what  they  want  from  the 
media, but they know what they do not want and trust their abil-
ity to choose correctly. A discussion of television critics one night 
revealed  that  Levittowners  read  their  judgments,  but  do  not 
necessarily accept  them.  "The critics  see  so  much  that  they can-
not  give  us  much  advice,"  said  one.  "They are  too  different  in 
their interests from the audience, and cannot be reviewers for it," 
said another. 

Forty per cent of  the  people  interviewed  said  they  were  read-
ing  new  magazines  since  moving  to  Levittown;  general-interest 
periodicals--Life, Look, Reader's Digest, Time, and the Saturday 
Evening Post-led the list. Only g of the 52 magazines were house-
and-garden  types such as American HO"me  and Better Homes and 
Gardens, but then 88  per cent of the people were already reading 
these, at least in the year they moved  to Levittown. Although not 
a single person said these magazines had helped in the decision to 
buy  a  home  in  Levittown,  57  per  cent  reported  that  they  had 
gotten  ideas  from  the  magazines  to  try  out  in  their  houses,  pri-
marily  on  the  use  of  space,  furniture,  and  shrubbery  arrange-
ments,  what  to  do  about  pictures and drapes,  and  how  to  build 
shelves  and  patios.  The  magazines  provided  help  on  functional 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

rather than esthetic problems of fixing  up the new house.  People 
rarely  copied  something  directly  from  the  magazines,  however. 
Most  often,  their  reading  gave  them  ideas  which  they  then 
altered for their own use,  sometimes after talking them over with 
the neighbors. Similarly, people who adopted new furniture styles 
after moving to Levittown got their inspiration from  their neigh· 
bors rather than  from magazines, although all who changed styles 
(but  only  53  per  cent  who  did  not)  said  they  had  obtained 
some  hints  for  the  house  from  the  home  and  garden  magazines. 
The  media  also  provide  "ideas"  for  community activities,  but 
these  are  altered  by  local  considerations  and  priorities.  For  ex-
ample,  a  few  days after the  Nixon-Kennedy  television  debates in 
1g6o,  candidates for  township offices  were asked  to  participate in 
a similar debate  in  Levittown.  Everyone liked the  idea, but after 
a  fe·w  innocuous  questions  by  out-of-town  reporters,  the  debate 
turned into the traditional candidates' night, in which politicians 
from  both  parties baited  their opponents from  the audience with 
prepared  questions.  Sometimes,  local  organizations  put  on  ver-
sions  of  TV  quiz  games,  and  honored  retiring  officers  with  a 
"This Is  Your Life"  presentation.  A  few  clubs,  especially Jewish 
ones,  held  "beatnik"  parties,  but  since  most  Levittowners  had 
never  seen  a  beatnik,  the  inspiration  for  their  costumes  came 
from  the mass media. 

The  impact  of  the  media  is  most  apparent  among  children: 
they are easily  impressed  by television commercials, and mothers 
must  often  fight  off  their  demands  on  shopping  trips.  But  the 
adults  are  seldom  touched  deeply;  media  content  is  always  sec-
ondary to more  personal  experience.  For example,  people  talked 
about  articles  on  child-rearing  they  had  seen  in  popular  maga-
zines,  but  treated  them  as  topics  of  conversation  rather  than  as 
possible guides for  their own behavior. A  neighbor who had read 
that "permissive" child-rearing was  going out of style after thirty 
years  had  never  even  hearcl  of  it  before,  even  though  she  had 
gone to college.  I  remember discussing Cuba with another neigh-
bor,  an  Air  Force  officer,  shortly after  Castro confiscated  Ameri-
can property there. Although he had been telling me endless and 
angr~·  stories  about  being  exploited  by  his  superiors  and  about 
corruption among high-ranking officers,  he could not see  the sim-
ilarity between his position and that of the Cuban peasant under 
Batista,  and  argued  strenuously  that  Castro  should  be  over· 
thrown. His opinions reflected those of  the media,  but their con·

tent  did  not  interest  him  enough  to  relate  it  to  his  own  experi-
ences.  He did,  however,  feel  that Castro  had  insulted  the United 
States-and him personally-and the media helped him belong to 
the national  society in  this way.  Indeed,  the media are a  message 
from  that  society,  which,  like  all  others,  remains  separate  from 
the  more  immediate  realities  of self,  family,  home,  and  friends. 
These  messages  really  touch  only  the  people  who  feel  isolated 
from  local  groups  or  who,  like  the  cosmopolitans,  pay  close  at-
tention to the printed word and the screen image. 

Levittown  and  the  Mass  Society 

The  Levittowners'  local  orientation  will  not  prevent  them 
from  becoming  submissive  tools  of  totalitarian  demagogues  if, 
according  to  the  critics  of  mass  society,  the  community  is  too 
weak  to  defy  the  power  of  the  state.  Social  scientists  concerned 
about  the  danger  of  dictatorship  have  often  claimed,  with  De 
Toqueville,  that  the  voluntary  association  is  the  prime  bulwark 
against  it.  For  example,  Wilensky  writes:  "In  the  absence  of 
effective mediating ties,  of meaningful  participation in voluntary 
associations, the population becomes vulnerable to mass behavior, 
more  susceptible  to  personality  appeals  in  politics,  more  ready 
for  the  demagogues  who  exploit  fanatical  faiths  of  nation  and 
race." G 

If Wilensky  is  correct,  Levittowners should be  invulnerable to 
mass  behavior,  for  they  have  started  about  a  hundred  voluntary 
associations  and 73  per cent of the two  interview  samples  belong 
to  at  least  one.  Levittown  should  also  be  more  immune  than 
other communities,  for  about  half of  both  interview  samples  re-
ported  more  organizational  participation  than  in  the  former 
residence. 6  The  way  they  participate,  however,  has  little  conse-
quence  for  their relation  to  the national  society.  The handful  of 
leaders  and  really  active  people  become  familiar  with  the  me-
chanics  of  organizational  and  municipal  politics,  but  the  rank-
and-file  members,  coming  to  meetings  mainly  for  social  and ser-
vice  reasons,  are  rarely  involved  in  these  matters.  Yet  not  even 
the  active  participants  are  exposed  to  national  issues  and  ques-
tions, and they learn little about the ways of coping with the ma-
nipulatory  techniques  feared  by  the critics  of mass  society. 

Nor  does  participation  necessarily  provide  democratic  experi-
ence.  Organizations  with  active  membership  are  likely  to  have 
democratic politics, but when the membership is passive,  they are 

•  194  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

often run by an  individual or a  clique and there is  little demand 
for  democratic  procedure.  Nothing  in  the  nature  of  the  volun-
tary  association  would,  however,  preclude  mob  behavior  and 
mass  hysteria  when  the  members demand  it.  The ad  hoc  groups 
that arose during the school  budget fight and in the controversies 
over liquor, nonresident doctors, and fluoridation,  often acted  in 
near-hysterical  ways.  Admittedly,  these  were  temporary organiza-
tions;  permanent ones,  conscious  of their  image,  are more likely 
to  refrain  from  such  behavior  and,  like  political  parties,  often 
avoid taking stands on controversial issues.  They do  inhibit mob 
action--or,  rather,  they refuse  to  be associated with  it,  forcing it 
into temporary organizations. Yet  if the majority of a  permanent 
group's  membership  is  angry  about  an  issue,  it can  act  out  that 
anger  and  even  put  its  organizational  strength  behind  hysteria. 
At  the  time of racial  integration,  a sizeable  faction  in  one  of  the 
men's  groups  was  contemplating  quasi-violent  protest,  and  was 
restrained  as  much  by  pressure  from  the  churches,  the  builder, 
and  some  government  officials  as  by  cooler  heads  within  the 
group. 

Mob action and mass  hysteria are usually produced by intense 
clashes  of  interest between  citizens and  government  agencies,  es-
pecially  if  government  is  not  responsive  to citizens'  demands.  If 
an  issue  is  especially  threatening  and  other  avenues  for  coping 
with  it  are  blocked,  irrational  action  is  often  the  only  solution. 
Under  such  conditions,  voluntary  associations  can  do  little  to 
quell  it,  partly  because  they  have  no  direct  role  in  the  govern-
ment,  but  mainly  because  their  impact  on  their  membership  is, 
in  Wilensky's  terms,  not  meaningful  enough  to divert  members 
from affiliating with violent protest groups.  Even national officers 
of voluntary associations  can rarely control  irrational actions  by 
local  branches,  especially since  these  rarely come  to  "national's" 
attention. 

The other relationships of the individual  Levittowner vis-a-vis 
the national  society  are so  indirect  that  it would be hard to pin-
point where  and  how  the  two  confront each  other.  It would  be 
harder still  to convince the average Levittowner, locally oriented 
as  he  is,  to  change  his  stance.  Unlike  the  aristocrat  or  the  intel-
lectual,  who  was  once  able as  an  individual  to  influence  the na-
tional  society  and  still  attempts to do  so,  the Levittowners come 
from a  tradition-and from  ancestors-too poor or too European 
even  to  conceive  the  possibility  that  they  could  affect  their  na-

The  Vitality  of  Community  Culture 

•  195  • 

tion.  And  unlike  the  cosmopolitans  of  today,  they  have  not  yet 
learned that they ought to try.  As a result,  the Levittowner is  not 
likely  to act  unless and  until  national  issues  impinge directly on 
his  life.  When  this  does  happen,  he  is  as  frustrated  as  the  cos-
mopolitan about how  to be effective.  All  he can really do is  voice 
his opinion at the ballot box, write letters to his congressman, or 
join  protest  groups.  In  times  of  crisis,  none  of  these  can  change 
the  situation  quickly  enough,  and  this  of  course  exacerbates 
threat,  hysteria,  and  the  urge  toward  mob  action  or  scapegoat-
ing. 

The  national  society  and  the  state  have  not  impinged  neg-
atively  on  the  average  Levittowner,  however;  indeed,  they  have 
served  him  well,  making  him  generally  content  with  the  status 
quo.  The  Congress  is  dominated  by  the  localistic  and  other 
values  of  the  white lower middle  and  working class  population, 
and  since  the goods  and  services  provided  by  the  influential  na-
tional corporations are designed largely for  people like the  Levit-
towners,  they  have  little  reason  to  question  corporate  behavior. 
The  considerable  similarity  of  interests  between  Levittowners 
and  the  nationally powerful  agencies,  private and  public,  makes 
it  unnecessary  for  the  Levittowners  to  concern  themselves  with 
the  national  society  or  to  delude  themselves  about  the  sov-
ereignty  of  the local  community.7 

What  appears  as  apathy  to  the  critics  of suburban  life  is  sat-
isfaction with the way  things are going, and what is  interpreted as 
a  "retreat" into localism and familism is  just ahistorical  thinking. 
Most  lower  middle  and  working  class  people  have  always  been 
localistic  and  familistic;  even  during the  Depression they  joined 
unions  only  when  personal  economic  difficulties  gave  them  no 
other alternative,  becoming inactive  once  these  were  resolved  or 
when it was clear that political activity was  fruitless. 8  Indeed, the 
alleged retreat is  actually an advance,  for  the  present generation, 
especially  among  working  class  people,  is  less  isolated  from  the 
larger society than its parents, less suspicious, and more willing to 
believe  that  it  can  participate  in  the community and  the  larger 
society.  The belief is fragile  and rarely exercised,  but people  like 
the  Levittowners  confront  the  national  society  more  rationally 
than  their  ancestors  did,  and  if  the  signs  of  progress  are  few, 
progress  has  nevertheless  taken  place.  Whether  there  has  been 
enough  progress  to  prevent  the  emergence  of  dictatorship  in  a 
severe  national  crisis  is  hard  to  tell,  but  certainly  the  Levit-

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

towners  and  their  community  fit  few  of  the  prerequisites  that 
would make  them willing tools of totalitarian leaders  today. 

TRANSIENCE  AND  ROOTLESSNESS 

Part  of  the  fear  of  mass  society  theorists  and  suburban  cnucs 
alike is  the  transience of the new suburban communities and the 
feelings of rootlessness  that allegedly result. About 20  per cent of 
Levittown's  first  purchasers  were  Transients,  who  knew  even 
when  they  came  that  their  employers--national  corporations  or 
the armed services-would require them to move elsewhere some 
years  hence. Their impermanency is  reflected in residential  turn-
over figures  which showed that in  1964,  10  percent of the houses 
were resold and another 5  per cent rented, and that annual  tum-
over was  likely to reach  20  per cent in the future. 9  Not all  houses 
chllnge  hands  that  often,  of  course;  a  small  proportion  are 
sold  and rented over and  over again. 10  Much  of  the  initial  tum-
over  resulted  from  job  transfers--55  per cent  in  1g6o,  with  an-
other 10 per cent from job changes. 11 

'Whether or not the  15  per cent turnover figure  is  "normal"  is 
difficult  to say.  National estimates of mobility suggest that 20  per 
cent  of  the  population  moves  annually,  but  this  figure  includes 
renters.  Levittown's rate is  probably high  in comparison  to older 
communities  of  home  owners,  fairly  typical  of newer  ones,  and 
low  in  comparison  to apartment areas. 12  Conventional  standards 
of "normal" turnover are so old and communities like Levittown 
still  so  new on  the American scene  that  it is  impossible  to deter-
mine a normal turnover rate. Indeed, the need to judge turnover 
stems from  the  assumption  that it is  undesirable;  once  there are 
sufficient  data  to  test  this  assumption,  the  concept  of  normal 
turnover can perhaps be dismissed. 

The  crucial  element  in  turnover  is  not  its  extent  but  the 
change  in  population  composition  and  its  consequences.  If the 
departing  Transients and  Mobiles are replaced  by Settlers,  then 
turnover will of course be reduced. Early in the 1g6os, the second 
buyers were,  however, also Transients, who needed a  house more 
quickly  than  the  builder  could  supply  it,  as  well  as  people  of 
lower income  (probably Settlers)  who could  not afford  the down 
payment on a new house. If more of the latter come to Levittown 
over the years,  the proportion of lower-status  people  in the com-
munity will  increase,  and there may be fears  of status loss among 

The  Vitality  of  Community  Culture 

•  197  • 

those of higher status. Although such  fears  were  rare  during  my 
time in the community, they existed on a  few  blocks and may ac· 
count in  part for  the strong reactions  to  status-depriving govern-
mental actions that I described earlier. 

Despite  the  belief  that  Transients  do  not  participate  in  com-
munity life,  in Levittown  they belonged to community organiza. 
tions  in considerably larger numbers than Settlers did,  partly be-
cause  of  their  higher  status.U  More  of  them  also  reported  in-
creased  participation  after  moving  to  Levittown  than  did  Set-
tlers.14  They  were,  however,  likely  to  list  fewer  people  with 
whom  they  visited  frequently. 16  Their  organizational  activity  is 
not  surprising,  for  being  used  to  transience,  they  are  socially 
quite  stable,  usually  gravitating  to  the  same  kinds  of  commu-
nities  and  joining  the  same  kinds  of  organizations  in  them.  In 
fact,  their mobility has  provided  them  with  more organizational 
experience  than  other Levittowners have,  enabling them  to help 
found several groups in the community. 

It has often been charged that modern transience and mobility. 
deprive  people  of  "roots."  Because  of the botanical  analogy,  the 
social  conception  of  the  word  is  difficult  to  define,  but  it  gener-
ally refers  to a  variety of stable roles and relationships which are 
recognized  by  other  residents.  Traditionally,  these  roles  were 
often  defined  by  one's  ancestors  as  well.  Such  roots  are  hard  to 
maintain today and few  people can resist the  temptation of social 
or occupational mobility that requires a physical move.  This does 
not  mean,  however,  that  the  feeling  of  rootedness  has  disap-
peared.  One  way  in  which  Transients  maintain  it is  to  preserve 
the  term  "home"  for  the  place  in  which  they  grew  up.  \Vhen 
Levittowners  talk  of  "going  home,"  they  mean  trips  to  visit 
parents.  People whose parents have  left  the community in  which 
they  grew  up may,  however,  feel  homeless.  I  remember a  discus-
sion with a  Levittowner who explained that he was  going "home 
to  Ohio"  to  visit  his  mother,  and  his  wife  said  somewhat  sadly, 
"My  parents no  longer live  where  I  grew  up,  and  I  never  lived 
with them where they live now. So  I  have only Sudberry Street in 
Levittown;  I  have  no  other  home."  Because  they  were  Tran-
sients, she could  not think of Levittown as  home and, like many 
others,  looked  forward  to  the  day  when  her  husband's  occupa-
tional  transience  would  come  to  an  end  and  they  would  settle 
down. 

Such Transients obviously lack roots in an objective sense and 

•  lg8  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

may also have feelings of rootlessness.  My impression is  that these 
feelings are not intense or frequent.  One way they are coped with 
is  by  moving  to  similar  communities and  putting down  tempo-
rary  roots;  another,  by  joining organizations made  up  of  fellow 
Transients.16  Professionals  who are  transient  often  develop roots 
in  their profession  and its social  groups.  As  Melvin  Webber and 
others  have  argued,  occupational  or  functional  roots  are  replac-
ing spatial roots for  an ever increasing proportion of the  popula-
tion.n This kind of rootedness is  easier for men to establish  than 
for women, and wives,  especially the wives of professionals, often 
suffer  more  from  transience  than  their  husbands.  Some  become 
attached to national voluntary associations-as men in nonprofes-
sional  occupations  do--and  develop  roots  within  them.  This  is 
not entirely satisfactory,  however,  for it provides  feelings  of root-
edness in only a single role, whereas spatial rootedness cuts across 
all  roles,  and  rewards  one  for  what  one  is  rather  than  for  what 
one does. 

New  communities  like  Levittown  make  it  possible  for  resi-
dents,  even  Transients, to  put down roots almost at once.  People 
active in organizations become known quickly;  thus they are able 
to  feel  part  of  the  community.  Despite  Levittown's  size,  shop-
keepers  and  local  officials  get  to know  people  they  see  regularly, 
offering  the  feeling  of being recognized  to  many.  The ministers 
take  special  care  to  extend  such  recognition,  and  the  churches 
appoint  themselves  to  provide  roots-and deliberately,  for  it at-
tracts  people  to  the  church.  Protestant  denominations sought to 
define  themselves  as  small-town  churches  with  Colonial  style 
buildings  because  these  have  been  endowed  with  an  image  of 
rootedness. 

Intergenerational rootedness  is  seldom found  today in any sub-
urban  or urban  community--or,  for  that  matter,  in most  small 
towns-for  it requires  the  kind  of economic  stability  (and  even 
stagnancy)  characteristic  only  of  depressed  areas  of  the  country. 
Moreover,  the  romanticizing  of  this  type  of  rootedness  ignores 
the  fact  that  for  many people  it blocked  progress,  especially  for 
low-status persons who were, by reason of residence and ancestry, 
permanently defined  as  "shiftless"  or  "good for  nothing."  Roots 
can st£angle growth as well as encourage it. 

Transience  and  mobility  are  something  new  in  middle  class 
American  life,  and  like  other  innovations,  they  have  been 
greeted  by  predictions  of  undesirable  consequences,  on  family 

The  Vitality  of  Community  Culture 

•  199  • 

life,  school  performance,  and  mental  health,  for  example.  Inter· 
views  with  school  officials,  doctors,  and  policemen  indicated, 
however,  that Transients appeared no more often as  patients and 
police  or  school  problems  and  delinquents  than  other  Levit-
towners.  Transience  can  create  problems,  but  it  has  different 
e_f!ects  for d~lferent people.  For young men, a  transfer usually in-
cludes  a  promotion  or a  raise;  for  older  ones  it  may  mean  only 
another physical  move or a  transfer  to a corporate "Siberia." If a 
Transient is  attached  to  his  home,  but  is  asked  to  move  by  his 
company, he can say  "no" only once or twice  before being asked 
to  resign  or  face  relegation  to  the  list  of  those  who  will  not  be 
promoted  further.  The  move  from  one  place  to  another  is  a 
pleasure  for  few  families,  but  the  emotional  costs  can  easily  be 
overestimated. 18  Because  Transients  move  to  and  from  similar 
types  of  communities,  they  have  little  difficulty  adapting  them-
selves  to  their  new  homes.  In  large  corporations,  they  generally 
receive  advice  about  where  to  look  for  housing,  often  going  to 
areas  already settled  by colleagues who help them make  the resi-
dential transition. 

Frequent moving  usually  hurts  other  family  members  more 
than  the  breadwinner.  Wives  who  had  made  good  friends  in 
Levittown  were  especially  sad  to  go,  and  adolescents  object 
strenuously to  leaving their peers,  so  that parents generally  try  to 
settle  down  before  their  children  enter  high  school.  For  wives 
and  adolescents  transience  is  essentially  an  involuntary  move, 
which,  like  the  forced  relocation  of slum  dwellers  under  urban 
renewal,  may result  in  depression  and other deleterious effects. 19 
Transience  may  also  engender  difficulties  when  problems  of 
social  mobility antedate  or accompany it,  as  in  the case  of older 
corporate  employees  who  must  transfer  without  promotion,  or 
suburbanites  who  move  as  a  result  of  downward  or  extremely 
rapid upward social  mobility. 20  Studies among children of Army 
personnel,  who  move  more  often  than  corporation  Transients, 
have  found  that  geographical  mobility  per  se  did  not  result  in 
emotional  disturbance,21  except  among  children  whose  fathers 
had risen  from  working  class  origins  to  become  officers.22 

These  findings  would  suggest  that  transience  has  its  most 
serious effects  on  people with  identity problems.  The individual 
who lacks a fairly firm sense of his identity will have difficulties in 
coping with  the  new  experiences  he  encounters  in  moving.  He 
will  also  suffer  most  severely  from  rootlessness,  for  he  will  be 

•  200  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

hindered  in  developing  the  relationships  and  reference  groups 
that  strengthen  one's  identity.  This  might  explain  why  adoles-
cents  find  moving so  difficult.  Transients  without  roots  in  their 
community  of  origin  or  their  jobs  must  rely  on  their  family 
members  in  moments  of  stress.  Sometimes,  the  family  becomes 
more cohesive  as  a  result,  but since  stresses  on  one  family  mem-
ber are likely  to affect  all  others,  the family  is  not always  a relia-
ble  source  of support.  I£  identity  problems  are  also  present,  the 
individual  may  have  no  place  to  turn,  and  then  transience  can 
produce  the  anomie  that  critics  have  found  rampant  in  the 
suburbs. But such people are a  small minority in Levittown. 

THE  VITALITY OF LEVITIOWN:  THE ADULT  VIEW 

When  the  Levittowners  were  asked  whether  they  considered 
their community dull, just 20 per cent of the random sample said 
yes,  and  of  Philadelphians  (who  might  have  been  expected  to 
find  it dull  after  living  in a  big  city),  only  14  per cent.23  Many 
respondents were surprised at the very question, for  they thought 
there was  a  great deal  to do  in  the  community,  and all  that was 
needed  was  a  desire  to  participate.  "It's  up  to  you,"  was  a  com-
mon  reaction.  "I£ a  person  is  not  the  friendly  type  or  does  not 
become active, it's their own fault."  "I don't think it's dull here," 
explained  another,  "there  are  so  many  organizations  to  join." 
Some  people  noted  that  Levittown  was  short  of  urban  amuse-
ments,  but  it  did  not  bother  them.  A  former  Philadelphian 
pointed  out:  "If Levittown  is  compared  to  city  living,  there  are 
no  taverns  or  teenage  hangout  places.  Then  it  is  dull.  But  we 
never had any of this in our own neighborhood and it's even bet-
ter  here . . . .  We  are  perfectly  content  here,  I'm  afraid.  Social 
life  is  enough  for  us;  we  are  becoming  fuddy-duddy."  Nostalgia 
for  urban  places was  not  common;  most  people  felt  like  the one 
who  said,  "We  like  quiet  things  . . .  visiting,  sitting  out  front 
in  summer,  having  people  dropping  by."  And  if  Levittown 
seemed  quiet  to  some,  it  did  not  to  others.  "This  is  the  wildest 
place  I've  ever  been.  Every weekend  a  party,  barbecues,  picnics, 
and  things  like  that.  I  really  enjoy  it." 24  The  only  people  who 
thought  Levittown  was  indeed  dull  were  the  socially  isolated, 
and upper middle class people who had tasted  the town's organi-
zational life and found it wanting.

The  Vitality  of  Community  Culture 
i~ t~at ~hey find vitalityin other people and organizational activi-
ties;  the community  is  less  important.  That community  may  be 
dull  by  conventional  standards  (which  define  vitality  by  urban 
social  mixture and cultural  riches)  but Levittowners  reject  these 
standards;  they  do  not want  or  need  that  kind  of vitality  or ex-
citement.  Mothers get  their share of it from  the daily adventures 
of  their children  and  the  men  get  it at work.  The  threshold  for 
excitement  is  low,  and  for  many,  excitement  is  identified  with 
conflict,  crisis,  and  deprivation.  Most  L~vittowners grew  up  in 
the  Depression,  and  remembering  the  hard  times  of  their child-
hood,  they  want  to  protect  themselves  and  their  children  from 
stress. 

_b.p~tl1er difference  in values  between critics and Levittowners 
~at play here.  The Italians who lived in  the center city working 
class  neighborhood  I  studied  before  Levittown  were  bored  by 
"the country"-in which  they  included  the suburbs-and so  are 
critics  of  suburbia,  albeit  for  different  reasons.  Many  working 
class  city dwellers  enjoy street  life and  urban  eating or drinking 
places;  upper  middle  class  critics  like  crowds  and  cosmopolitan-
ism.  The lower  middle  class and  the kinds  of  working class  peo-
ple that came to Levittown had no interest in  either. Even  previ-
ous urbanites  had  made little  if  any use  of  the  cultural  facilities 
valued  by  the  cosmopolitan,  and  had  no  need  for  them  in  the 
suburbs.  And  as  the  struggles  over  the  liquor issue  suggest,  they 
want  none  of  the  vitality  sought  by  th~ working  class  urbanite, 
for  they  are  just  escaping  corner  bars  and  the  disadvantages  of 
aging  urban areas.  What  they do want  is  a  kind of interpersonal 
vitality along  with  privacy  and  peace  and  quiet. 23  Vicarious  ex-
citement 
is  something  else  again.  Television  provides  pro-
grammed  and  highly  predictable  excitement,  but  it can  get  bor-
ing.  A  fire  or  accident,  a  fight  at  a  municipal  or  school  board 
meeting,  and  marital  strife  or  minor  misbehavior among  neigh-
bors  involve  real  people  and  known  ones.  The excitement  they 
provide  is  also  vicarious,  but  it  is  not  programmed and  is  there-
fore  more rewarding. 

The Blandness of Lower Middle Class Culture 

_Levittown's criteria for  vitality may spell  dullness  to  the critic 
and  the  visitor,  partly because  much of community life  is  invisi-
kle.  Lower  middle  class  life  does  not  take  place ·either  on  the 
street or in meetings and parties;  it is  home-centered and private. 

•  202  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

Once  one  penetrates  behind  the door,  however,  as  does  the  par-
ticipant-observer,  people  emerge  as  personalities  and  few  are 
either dull  or bland.  But when all  is  said and done, something is 
different:  less  exuberance  than  is  found  in  the  working  class,  a 
more  provincial  outlook  than  in  the  upper  middle  class,  and  a 
somewhat  greater  concern  with  respectability  than  in  either.  In 
part,  this  is  a  function  of  religious  background:  being  largely 
Protestant,  the lower middle class  is  still  affected  by  the  Puritan 
ethos.  It lacks  the regular opportunity for  confession  that allows 
some  Catholics  to  live  somewhat  more  spiritedly,  and  has  not 
adopted  the  sharp  division  into  sacred  and  secular  culture  that 
reduces Jewish religiosity to observance of the High Holidays and 
permits  Jews  to  express  exuberance  in  their  organizational,  so-
cial, and cultural activities.  But the difference  is  not entirely due 
to  Puritanism,  for  "restrictive"  lower  middle  class  culture  ap-
pears  also  among  Catholics  who  have  moved  "up,"  especially 
German  and  Irish  ones,  and  even  among  Italians  and  among 
some Jews who have risen from working class origins. 

If "blandness"  is  the  word  for  this  quality,  it  stems  from  the 
transition in which the lower middle class finds itself between tlie 
familial  life  of the working class  and  the cosmopolitanism  of the 
upper middle class.  The working class  person need conform only 
within  the  family  circle  and  the  peer group,  but these  are  toler-
ant of his  other activities.  Believing that the outside world  is  un-
alterably hostile and  that little  is  to  be gained from  its  approval, 
he can  indulge in  boisterousness  that provides catharsis from  the 
tensions  generated  in  the  family  and  peer  circles.  The  upper 
middle  class  person,  on  the  other  hand,  is  lodged  firmly  in  the 
world outside  the  home.  At  times  he  may  have  trouble  reconcil-
ing the demands of home and outside world,  but he  has  a  secure 
footing in both. 

Lower middle class people seem to me to be caught in the mid-
dle. Those whose origins were in the working class  are no longer 
tied  lio  strongly  to  the  extended  family,  but  although  they  have 
gone out into  the larger society,  they  are  by no means at ease  in 
it. They do not share the norms of the cosmopolitans, but, unlike 
the working class,  they cannot ignore them.  As  a  result,  they find 
themselves  in  a  situation  in  which  every  neighbor  is  a  potential 
friend  or enemy and  every community issue  a  source of conflict, 
producing a  restraining and  even  inhibiting  influence  on  them. 
Others,  lower  middle  class  for  generations,  have  had  to  move 

The  Vitality  of  Community  Culture

from a  rural  or small-town  social  structure. They too  are  caught 
in  the  middle,  for  now  they  must  cope  with  a  larger  and  more 
heterogeneous  society,  for  which  their cultural and religious  tra-
ditions have not equipped them. 

If left  to  themselves,  lower  middle  class  people  do  what  they 
have always done:  put their energies into home and family,  seek-
ing  to  make  life  as  comfortable  as  possible,  and  supporting, 
broadening, and varying it with friends,  neighbors, church, and a 
voluntary associiltion. Because this way  of life is much like that of 
the small-town society or  the urban neighborhood in which they 
grew  up,  they  are  able  to  maintain  their  optimistic  belief  that 
Judeo-Christian  morality  is  a  reliable  guide  to  behavior.  This 
world  view (if one can endow it with so  philosophical a  name)  is 
best seen in  the pictures that amateur painters exhibited at PTA 
meetings in Levittown:  bright, cheerful landscapes, or portraits of 
children  and  pets  painted  in  primary colors,  reflecting  the  wish 
that the world be hopeful, humorous, and above all, simple.  Most 
important, their paintings insisted  that life can  be happy. 

Of course,  life  is  not really like  this,  for  almost everyone must 
live with  some disappoiutment:  an  unruly child, a  poor student, 
an unsatisfied husband, a  bored wife, a  bad job, a chronic illness, 
or financial  worry.  These realities are accepted because  they can-
not  be  avoided;  it  is  the  norms  of  the  larger  society  which  frus-
trate.  Partly desired and partly rejected, they produce an ambiva-
lence  which  appears  to  the  outsider  as  the  blandness  of  lower 
middle class  life. This ambivalence can  be  illustrated by  the  way 
Levittown  women  reacted  to  my  wife's  paintings.  Since  her 
studio was at home,  they had an opportunity to see her work and 
talk to her about being a  painter. The working class Italians with 
whom we had lived in Boston previously knew, by and large, how 
to  deal  with  her  activity.  Unacquainted  with  "art,"  they  could 
shrug  off  her  activity  and  her  abstract  expressionist  style  to  ad-
mire colors they liked or forms  that reminded them of something 
in their own experience.  Not knowing what it all  meant, and not 
having  to  know,  they concluded  that  painting  was  a  good  thing 
because  it  kept  her out  of  trouble,  preventing boredom  and  po-
tentially  troublesome  consequences  such  as  drinking  or  extra-
marital affairs. 

The lower middle class  Levittowners could  not cope  with  her 
paintings  as  easily.  They  did  not  like  her  abstract  expressionist 
style  any  more  than  the working class  women,  but  they  knew  it 

•  204  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

was  "art" and so  could not ignore  it.  They responded with anxi-
ety, some hostility, and particularly with envy of her ability to be 
"creative."  But  even  this  response  was  overlaid  with  ambiva-
lence. As  teenagers they had learned that creativity was desirable, 
and  many  had  had  some  cursory  training  in  drawing,  piano,  or 
needlework.  Once they had learned to be wives and mothers and 
had enough sociability,  the urge for creativity returned-but not 
the opportunity. 

For working class  women, keeping the  family  together and the 
bills  paid  is  a  full-time  job.  Upper middle class  women  are con-
vinced that life ought to be more than raising a family,  but lower 
middle  class  ones  are  not  that  sure.  They  want  to  venture  into 
nonfamilial  roles,  but not so  int,ensively as  to engender role con-
flict  and anxiety.  As a  result,  they search for  easy creativity, activ-
ities  that  do  not require,  as  Levittowners  put  it,  "upsetting  the 
family  and  household."  Serious  artistic activity  is  difficult  under 
such conditions, yet a compromise solution such as  needlework or 
painting-by-numbers  is  not  entirely  satisfactory  either,  because, 
however  rewarding,  people  know  it  is  not really  art.  One Levit-
towner  I  met  expressed  the  ambivalence  between  the  familial 
role and artistic aspirations in an especially tortured way.  She ex-
plained  that  she  was  very  sensitive  to  paintings,  but  confessed 
that  whenever  she  visited  museums,  she  would  begin  to  think 
about  her  family.  She  resolved  the  ambivalence  by  rejecting 
paintings  that  made  her  "think  too  much  about  art."  For  most 
people,  however,  the  ambivalence  is  less  intense. 

A  similarly ambivalent  pattern  is  evident  in governmental  in-
volvement.  Many  lower  middle  class  people  believe  that  the 
moral  framework  which  governs  their personal  lives,  the  sort  of 
relations  they  have  with  family  members  and  friends,  ought  to 
govern  organizational  life  and society as  well.  Any other  type  of 
behavior they call  "politics," in and out of political life, and they 
try  to  avoid  it as  immoral.  Working class  people  have  the  same 
perspective,  but they are also  realists and will  exploit politics for 
their own  ends,  and  upper middle class  people  believe  in  moral 
(reform)  politics,  but  its  norms  are  not  borrowed  from  the  fam-
ily,  Lower  middle  class  citizens  are  once  again  caught  between 
the standards of home and of the outside world, however, and the 
result is often political inaction. It is for them that politicians put 
on  performances  to  show  that  their  decisions  are  based  on  the 
standards  of  home  and  family  and  run  election  campaigns dem-

The  Vitality  of  Community  Culture 
onstrating the personal  honesty of their candidates and the oppo-
sition candidates'  immorality. 

•  205  • 

Of course,  these are cultural  propensities to  act,  and when  per-
sonal  interests  are  threatened,  lower  middle  class  people  defend 
them as  heartily as  anyone else.  Then, they identify their actions 
with  morality-so  much  so  that  they  lose  sight, of  their  self-
interest  and  are  easily  hurt when  others  point  out  to  them  that 
they  are  selfishly  motivated.  Whereas  working class  people  then 
become  cynical,  lower  middle  class  people  become  hypocritical, 
often without being conscious of it.  Blandness  turns easily  to bit-
terness,  anger,  and  blind  conflict-blind  because  every  act  of 
offense  or self-defense  is  clothed  in  the  terminology  of  personal 
morality. 

What appears as  blandness,  then,  to the outside observer is  the 
outcome  of  conflict  between self  and society,  and  between  what 
ought to be and what is.  When and if a lower middle class person 
is  secure, he appears bland, because he is  not really willing to act 
within  the larger society;  when he  is  threatened,  he  is  extremely 
angry,  because his moral view of the world is  upset.  One target of 
his  anger  is  the  working  class  people  who  are  less  bothered  by 
the  moral  dilemmas  of  the  larger  society;  another  is  the  upper 
middle class activists who keep pressuring him to translate moral-
ity into action and to take a stand on·community issues. 

Many  of  these  cultural  predispositions  seem  to  occur  more 
among lower middle class  women than among their husbands.  If 
the men  are  employed  in a  bureaucracy,  as  most are,  their work 
involves  them not only  in the larger  society  but also  in  office  or 
factory  political  struggles  which  leave  them  little  time  to  think 
about  the  ambivalence  between  the standards  of  home  and  out-
side  world.  The  women,  however,  caught  in  a  role  that  keeps 
them at home, are forever trying to break out of its confines, only 
to confront ambivalent situations.  They respond  with inhibiting 
blandness;  it is  they who are most concerned with respectability. 
Indeed, living with neighbors employed in large bureaucracies, I 
was  struck  over  and  over  again  by  the  feeling  that  if  the  men 
were  "organization men,"  they were  so  only by  necessity,  not by 
inclination, and that if they were left alone,  they would gravitate 
toward  untrammeled  creativity  and  individualism.  Their wives, 
on the other hand, defended what Whyte called the Social  Ethic, 
rejecting extreme actions and skeptical  opinions, and tried to get 
their men  to  toe  the line  of lower middle class  morality.  If any-

•  200  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

thing,  their  inclinations  drove  them  toward  being "organization 
women."  But  then,  they had  the  job of  maintaining  the family's 
status  image  on  the  block,  and  they spent  their days  in  the near-
anarchy created  by small  children.  Perhaps  they  were  simply es-
caping into  the order of lower middle class norms, while the men 
were  escaping  from  the  order  imposed  by  their  bureaucratic 
work. 

LEVITIOWN IS "ENDSVILLE": THE ADOLESCENT VIEW 

The adult conception  of  Levittown's vitality  is  not shared  by its 
ii,dolescents.  Many  consider  it  a  dull  place  to  which  they  have 
been  brought  involuntarily  by  their  parents.  Often  there is-no 
place to go and nothing to do after school. Although most adoles-
cents  have no trouble in  their student role,  many are bored after 
school  and some  are  angry,  expressing that anger  through  thinly 
veiled  hostility  to  adults  and  vandalism  against  adult  property. 
Their relationship  to  the  adults  is  fraught  with  tension,  which 
discourages community .attempts to solve  what is defined as  their 
recreational problem. 

Essays  which  students  in  grades  6-12  wrote  for  me  early  in 
1961  suggest that most children are satisfied with Levittown until 
adolescence. 26  Sixty-eight  per  cent  of  the  sixth-graders  liked 
Levittown,  but  only  45  per  cent  of  the  eighth-graders,  37  per 
cent of  the  tenth-graders,  and  39  per cent  of  the  twelfth-graders 
did. In comparison, 85  per cent of the adults responded positively 
to  a  similar  question. 27  Likes  and  dislikes  reflect  the  state  of 
recreational  and  social  opportunities.  Girls  make  little  use  of 
recreational  facilities  until  they  become  adolescents,  and  before 
the  tenth  grade,  they  like  Levittown  better  than  the  boys.  Dis-
likes  revolve  around  "nothing  to  do."  The  sixth- and  eighth-
grade boys say  there are not enough gyms,  playing fields,  or hills, 
and no transportation for getting to existing facilities.  Both sexes 
complain  about  the  lack  of  neighborhood  stores  and  that  the 
houses  are  too  small,  lack  privacy,  and  are  poorly  built.  By  the 
twelfth  grade,  disenchantment with  the  existing facilities  has  set 
in;  those  who like  Levittown  stress  the  newness and  friendliness 
of the community,  but references  to  the pool,  the  shopping cen-
ter,  and  the  bowling  alley  are  negative. 28  As  one  twelfth-grader 
pointed out,  "Either you  have  to pay a  lot of money to go  to  the 
movies  or  the  bowling  alley,  or you  go  to  too  many  parties and 

The  Vitality  of  Community  Culture

that gets  boring."  ~~ck of facilities ,is  reported most  often by the 
older girls,  for  the boys at least have athletic programs put on by 
civic groups. 29 

But  the  c~9_!1est gripe_ is  the  shortage  of  ready  transporta-
tio_Il!.  which makes  not only  facilities  but,  more  important,  other 
tt:.~.nage.rs- inaccessible.  One girl complained, "After school  hours, 
you  walk  into an entirely different world.  Everyone goes  his  own 
separate  way,  to  start  his  homework,  take  a  nap,  or  watch  TV. 
That is  the life  of a  vegetable,  not a  human  being." A  car,  then, 
becomes in a  way as  essential  to  teenagers as  to adults.  Moreover, 
many small-town  teenagers  like  to  meet  outside  the community, 
for  it  is  easier  to  "have  fun"  where  one's  parents  and  other 
known adults cannot disapprove. A high school senior who took a 
job to buy a car put it dramatically: 

I  had  no  choice,  it was  either going  to  work  or cracking 
up.  I  have  another week  of boring habits,  then  (when  I  get 
the car)  I'll  start living.  I  can  get  out of  Levittown  and  go 
to  other  towns  where  I  have  many  friends.  .  .  .  In  plain 
words, a  boy shouldn't live  here if he is  between  the ages of 
14-17.  At  this  age  he  is  using  his  adult  mind,  and  that 
doesn't mean riding a  bike or smoking his first cigarette. He 
wants to be big and popular and go out and live it up.  I  am 
just starting the life I  want.  I  couldn't ask  for  more than be-
ing a senior in a  brand new high school, with the best of stu-
dents and teachers, and my car on its way. 

Girls  are  less  likely  to  have  access  to  a  car,  and  one  explained, 
"We have  to  walk,  and  the  streets  wind,  and  cause  you  to  walk 
two miles instead of one as the crow flies." 

The adults have  provided some facilities  for  teenage activities, 
but not always  successfully.  One  problem  is  that "teenage" is  an 
adult  tag;  adolescents  grade  themselves  by  age.  Older  ones  re-
fused  to  attend  dances  with  the  younger  set,  considering  forced 
association  with  their  juniors  insulting.30  Some  adolescents  also 
found  the  adult chaperones  oppressive.  At  first,  the  chaperones 
interfered openly by urging strangers to dance with each other in 
order  to  get  everyone  on  the  floor  and  to  discourage  intimate 
dancing  among  couples.  When  the  teenagers  protested,  they 
stopped, but hovered uneasily in the background.31 

Specifically,  adolescent  malcontent  stems  from  two  sources: 
Levittown was not designed for  them, and adults are reluctant to 
provide the recreational facilities and gathering places they want. 

•  2o8  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

Like  most  suburban  communities,  Levittown  was  planned  for 
families with young children. The bedrooms are too small  to per-
mit an adolescent to do anything but study or sleep;  they lack the 
privacy  and  soundproofing  to  allow  him  to  invite  his  friends 
over.  Unfortunately,  the  community  is  equally  inhospitable. 
Shopping  centers are  intended  for  car-owning adults,  and  in  ac-
cord with the desire of property owners,  are kept away from  resi-
dential  areas.  Being  new,  Levittown  lacks  low-rent  shopping 
areas which can afford to subsist on the marginal purchases made 
by  adolescents.  In  1961,  a  few  luncheonettes  in  neighborhood 
shopping centers and a candy store and a bowling alley in the big 
center were the only places  for  adolescents  to congregate.32  Com-
ing in droves,  they overwhelmed  those  places and  upset  the  mer-
chants.  Not  only do  teenagers  occupy space  without making sig-
nificant  purchases,  but  they  also  discourage  adult  customers. 
Merchants faced  with high rent cannot subsist on teenage  spend-
ing  and  complain  to  the  police  if  teenagers  "hang  out"  at  their 
places.  Street  corners  are  off  limits,  too,  for  a  clump  of  adoles-
cents soon  becomes noisy enough  to  provoke a  call  to  the police. 
Eventually  they  feel  hounded  and  even  defined  as  juvenile  de-
linquents.  Said  one  twelfth-grade  girl,  "I  feel  like  a  hood  to  be 
getting chased by the police for absolutely nothing." 

The schools  were  not  designed  for  after-hours  use,  except  for 
adults  and  for  student  activities  which--entertain  adults,  such  as 
varsity athletics. The auditoriums were made available for dances, 
although  when  these  began,  the  school administration  promptly 
complained  about  scuffed  floors  and  damaged  fixtures.  Only  at 
the  swimming pool  are  teenagers not in  the  way  of adult priori-
ties,  and during the day,  when  adults are  not  using it,  it  is  their 
major gathering place.  But even  here,  smoking and noisy activi-
ties are prohibited. 

The design deficiencies cannot be altered, and should not be if 
they  are a  problem  only  for  teenagers,  but  there  is  no  inherent 
reason  why  teenage  facilities  cannot  be  provided.  However, 
adults disagree on what is  needed and,  indeed, on the desirability 
of facilities,  for reasons  partly political,  but fundamentally social 
and psychological.  For one thing, adults are uncertain about how 
to  treat  teenagers;  for  another,  they  harbor  a  deep  hostility  to-
ward  them  which  is  cultural  and,  at  bottom,  sexual  in  nature. 
There are  two  adult views  of the teenager,  one permissive,  the 

The  Vitality  of  Community  Culture 

other restrictive.  The former argues that a  teenager is  a responsi-
ble individual who should be allowed to run his own affairs with 
some adult help.  The  latter,  subscribed  to by  the  majority,  con-
siders him still a child who needs adult supervision and whose ac-
tivities  ought  to  be  conducted  by  adult  rules  to  integrate  him 
into adult society.  For example,  when  one of the community or-
ganizations  set  up  teenage  dances,  there  was  some  discussion 
about whether teenagers should run them.  Not only was  this idea 
rejected,  but  the  adults  then  ran  the dances  on  the  basis  of  the 
"highest" standards.33  Boys  were  required  to  wear  ties  and  jack-
ets,  girls,  dresses,  on  the  assumption  that  this  would  encourage 
good  behavior, whereas  blue jeans,  tee  shirts,  and sweaters  some-
how would  not.  The adults could  not resist  imposing  their own 
norms of dress in exchange for providing dances. 

The advocates  of restriction also  rejected  the  permissive  point 
of  view  because  they  felt  it  wrong  to  give  teenagers  what  they 
wanted.  Believing  that  teenagers  had  it  "too  easy,"  they  argued 
that "if you make  them work for  programs, they appreciate them 
more."  Logically,  they  should,  therefore,  have  let  the  teenagers 
set  up their own  activities,  but their arguments were  not guided 
by logic;  they were, rather, rationalizations  for their fear of teen-
agers.  Although  the  "permissives"  pointed  out  that  teenagers 
might  well  set  up  stricter  rules  than  adults,  the  "restrictives" 
feared  catastrophes:  fights,  the  "wrong crowd"  taking over,  preg-
nancies,  and contraceptives found  in or near the  teenage  facility. 
These fears  accounted for  the  rules governing dances  and  inhib-
ited the establishment of an adult-run teenage center, for  the vol-
untary associations and the politicians were afraid that if violence 
or sexual activity occurred, they would be blamed for it. 

The problem is  twofold:  restrictive adults want adolescents  to 
be children  preparing for  adulthood,  and  are  threatened  by  the 
teenage or youth  culture  they see  around  them.  By  now,  adoles-
cents  are  a  cultural  minority  like  any  other,  but  whereas  no 
Levittowners  expect  Italians  to  behave  like  Jews,  most  still  ex-
pect teenagers to behave like children. They are supposed  to par-
ticipate  in  the family  more  than  they do and,  legally still  under 
age,  to  subsume  their  own  wishes  to  the  adults'.  The failure  of 
teenagers  to go along is  blamed on  the parents as  well.  If parents 
would only tal-e more interest in their adolescent children, sp.end 
more time with  them,  be "pals" with  them, and so  on,  then mis-

behavior-and even  youth culture-would not develop.  This ar-
gument  is  supported  by  the claim  that delinquency  is  caused  by 
broken homes or by both parents' holding full-time jobs. 

Such  views  are  espoused  particularly  by  Catholics,  who  share 
traditional working class  attitudes;  the  parochial school, with  its 
emphasis on  discipline  to  keep children  out  of  trouble,  is  their 
embodiment.  Even  adult-devised  programs  are considered  unde-
sirable,  for,  as  one  Catholic working class  father  put it,  "In sum-
mer,  children  should  either  work  or  be-at  home.  Summer  arts 
and  crafts  programs are  a  waste  of  time.  My  kid  brought  home 
dozens  of  pictures.  What's  he  going  to  do  with  so  many  pic-
tures?"  The adolescents'  social  choices are also restricted.  Adults 
active in youth programs frequently  try to break up their groups, 
damning  them  as  cliques  or  gangs,  and  even  separating  friends 
when athletic teams are chosen. Some teenagers react by minimiz-
ing  contact  with  adults,  pursuing  their  activities  privately  and 
becoming  remarkably uncommunicative.  In essence,  they  lead  a 
separate  life  which  frees  them/from  undue  parental  control  and 
gives an air of mystery to the teenager and his culture. 

Among restrictive adults,  the image of the  teenager is  of an ir-
responsible,  parasitic  individual,  who  attends  school  without 
studying, hangs out with his  peers looking for  fun and adventure, 
and gets  into trouble-above all, over sex.  There were rumors of 
teenage  orgies  in  Levittown's  school  playgrounds,  in  shopping 
center  parking  lots,  and  on  the  remaining  rural  roads  of  the 
township.  The  most  fantastic  rumor  had  44  girls  in  the  senior 
class pregnant, with one boy singlehandedly responsible for six of 
them.  Some  inquiry on  my  part  turned  up  the  facts:  two  senior 
girls  were  pregnant  and  one  of  them  was  about  to  be  married. 
If the  essays  the  students  wrote  for  me  have  any  validity,  the 
gap  between  adult  fantasy  and  adolescent  reality  is  astonishing. 
Most  teenagers  do  not  even  date;  their  social  life  takes  place  in 
groups.  Judging  by  their  comments  about  the  friendliness  of 
adult  neighbors,  they  are  quiet  youngsters  who  get  along  well 
with  adults  and  spend  most  of  their  time  preparing  themselves 
for  adulthood.  Needless  to  say,  these  essays  would  not  have  re-
vealed  delinquent  activities  or  sex  play.  However,  I  doubt  that 
more  than  5  per cent  of  the older  teenagers  live  up to anything 
like the adult image of them. 

What,  then,  accounts  for  the  discrepancy?  For  one  thing, 
adults take little interest  in  their children's education;  they want 

The  Vitality  of  Community  Culture

• 

to be assured  that  their children are getting along in school,  but 
not  much  more.  The  bond  that  might  exist  here  is  thus absent. 
Changes  in  education  during  the  last  two  decades  have  been so 
great  that  even interested  parents can do little  to help  their chil-
dren with  their school  work.  Consequently,  adults focus  on teen-
agers  in  their nonstudent roles,  noting their absence  from  horne, 
the  intensity  of  their  tie  to  friends  and  cliques,  and  their  re-
belliousness. 

Second,  there  is  the  normal  gap  between  the  generations,  en-
larged by the recent flowering of youth culture, much of which is 
incomprehensible or unesthetic to adults. Despite the parents' be-
lief  that  they should  be  responsible  for  their  adolescents'  behav-
ior,  they cannot participate in many joint activities or talk mean-
ingfully  with  them  about  the  experiences  and  problems  of 
teenage  life.  This  gap  is  exacerbated  by  a  strange  parental  am-
nesia about their own-not so distant-adolescence. I  recall a  let-
ter  written by a  twenty-one-year-old  mother who wanted  to  help 
the Township Committee set  up a delinquency prevention coun-
cil  because she  was  concerned about teenage  misbehavior. 

Third,  there  is  enough  teenage  vandalism and delinquency  to 
provide  raw  material  for  the  adult  image,  although  not  enough 
to  justify  it.  According  to  the  police  and  the  school  superin-
tendent, serious delinquency in Levittown was  minimal;  in  1961, 
about  so  adolescents  accounted  for  most  of  it.  Many  were  chil-
dren  from  working class  backgrounds  who did  poorly  in  school, 
or from  disturbed middle class  families.  From  1959  to  1961, only 
12  cases  were serious  enough  to go  to  the county juvenile court, 
and some were repeaters.  Vandalism  is  more prevalent.  The first 
victim was the old Willingboro YMCA, which was  wrecked twice 
before  it  was  torn  down.  Schools  have  been  defaced,  windows 
broken,  garbage  thrown  into  the  pools,  ftowerbeds  destroyed, 
and bicycles. "borrowed." The perpetrators are rarely caught,  but 
those  who are  caught  are  teenagers,  thus  making  it  possible  for 
adults to suspect all adolescents and maintain their image. 

Finally,  some  adults  seem  to  project  their  own  desires  for  ex-
citement  and  adventures  onto  the  youngsters.  For  them,  teen-
agers  function  locally  as  movie  stars  and  beatniks do  on  the  na-
tional  ~cene-as exotic  creatures  reputed  to  live  for  sex  and  ad-
venture.  Manifestly,  teenagers  act  as  more  prosaic  entertainers: 
in varsity athletics, high school dramatic societies, and bands, but 
the girls are also expected to provide glamor.  One of the first  ac-

•  212  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

tivities  of  the  Junior  Chamber  of  Commerce  was  a  Miss  Levit-
town  contest,  in  which  teenage  girls  competed  for  honors  in 
evening  gown,  bathing  suit,  and  talent  contests-the  "talent" 
usually  involving  love  songs  or  covertly  erotic  dances.  At  such 
contests unattainable maidens show off their sexuality-often un-
consciously-in  order  to  win  the  nomination.  Men  in  the  audi-
ence  comment sotto  voce  about  the  girls'  attractiveness,  wishing 
to  sleep  with  them  and  speculating  whether  that  privilege  is 
available  to  the  contest  judges  and  boyfriends.  From  here,  it  is 
only a short step to the conviction that girls are promiscuous with 
their  teenage  friends,  which  heightens  adult envy,  fear,  and  the 
justification  for  restrictive  measures.  The se:lalal  function  of  the 
teenager  became  apparent  when  the  popularity  of  the  Miss 
Levittown contest led to plans for a  Mrs.  Levittown contest. This 
plan  was  quickly  dropped,  however,  for  the  idea  of  married 
women  parading in bathing suits was  thought to be in bad  taste, 
especially  by  the women.  Presumably,  young mothers are  poten-
tial  sexual  objects,  whereas  the  teenagers  are,  like  movie  stars, 
unattainable,  and  can  therefore  serve  as  voyeuristic  objects. 

Although suburbia is often described as a hotbed of adultery in 
popular fiction,  this  is  an  urban  fantasy.  Levittown  is  quite  mo-
nogamous,  and  I  am  convinced  that  most  suburbs  are  more  so 
than  most cities.34  The desire  for  sexual  relations with attractive 
neighbors may be ever present, but when life is lived in a goldfish 
bowl,  adultery is  impossible  to hide from  the  neighbors--even  if 
there  were  motels  in  Levittown  and  baby-sitters  could be found 
for  both  parties.  Occasionally  such  episodes  do  take  place,  after 
which  the  people  involved  often  run  off  together  or  leave  the 
community.  There are  also  periodic  stories of  more  bizarre  sex-
ual  escapades,  usually  about  community  leaders.  In  one  such 
story,  a  local  politician  was  driving down  the  dark roads  of  the 
township  in  a  sports  car  with  a  naked  young  woman  while  his 
wife  thought he was at a  political meeting. If there was any road-
side adultery, however,  it remained unreported, for no cases ever 
appeared  on  the  police  blotters  during  the  two  years  I  saw 
them. 3 ~  Similar stories  made  the rounds  in  Park Forest,  the  new 
town  I  studied  in  1949,  and  one  of  them,  which  began  after  a 
party  where  some  extramarital  necking  had  taken  place,  soon 
reported  the  gathering  as  a  wife-swapping orgy.

"The Juvenile  Problem"  and Its  Solutions 

The cultural differences  between  adults  and adolescents  have 
precipitated an  undeclared and subconscious war between them, 
as  pervasive  as  the  class  struggle,  which  prevents  the  adults 
from solving what they call  "~_ejuvenile problem." Indeed, put-
ting it that way is  part of the trouble, for much of the adult effort 
has  been  aimed  at -~iscouraging delinquency,  providing  recrea-
tional activities in the irrational belief that these could prevent it. 
Sports  programs were  supposed  to  exhaust  the  teenagers  so  that 
they would be too  tired to get into trouble  (harking back  to the 
Victorian myth  that a  regimen of cold showers and sports would 
dampen  sexual  urges,  although  ironically,  varsity  athletes  were 
also suspected of being stellar sexual  performers);  dances were to 
keep  them  off  the  street.  When  delinquency  did  not  abate,  a 
Youth  Guidance Commission  to deal  with "the problem," and a 
Teenage  Panel  to  punish  delinquencies  too  minor  for  court ac-
tions,  were  set  up.  The police chief  asked  for  a  curfew  to  keep 
youngsters off  the street at night, hoping to  put pressure on par-
ents  to act as  enforcing agents  and  to get his department out of 
the  cross  fire  between  teenagers,  merchants,  and  home  owners. 
Chasing  the  teenagers  from  shopping  centers and  street  corners 
was  useless,  for  having  no  other  place  to  go  they  always  re-
turned the next night, particularly since they knew people would 
not swear out complaints against their neighbors'  (or customers') 
children. The police chief also did not want "the kids to feel  they 
are being bugged," for they would come to hate his men and cre-
ate more  trouble  for  them.86  If he cracked  down  on  them,  they 
would  retaliate;  if  he  did  not,  the  adults  would  accuse  him  of 
laxity.  Although  the  curfew  was  strongly  supported  by  parents 
who  could  not  control  their  children,  it  was  rejected  as  unen-
forceable. 

Adult solutions to the juvenile problem were generally  shaped 
by  other institutional  goals which  took  priority  over  adolescent 
needs.  The organizations which scheduled  dances  wanted  to ad-
vertise themselves and their community service inclinations, even 
competing for  the  right  to  hold  them,  and  the  churches  set  up 
youth  groups  to  bring  the  teenagers  into  the  church.  Indeed, 
those  who decide  on adolescent  programs  either have  vested  in-
terests in keeping teenagers in a  childlike status (parents and  ed-
ucators, for example) or are charged with the protection of adult 

•  214  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

interests (police and politicians). The primacy of adult priorities 
was  brought  out  by  a  1961  PTA  panel  on  "How  Is  Our  Com· 
munity Meeting the Needs of the Adolescents?" With one excep· 
tion  the  panelists  (chosen  to represent the various adults respon· 
sible  for  teenagers)  ignored  these  needs,  talking only about what 
teenagers  should  do  for  them.  For  example,  the  parent  on  the 
panel  said,  "The needs  of adolescents should  first  be  met  in  the 
home and young energies  should  be guided  into  the proper nor· 
mal channels." The teacher suggested that "parents should never 
undermine  the  authority  of  the  teacher.  Parents  should  help 
maintain  the  authority  of  the  school  over  the  child,  and  the 
school will  in turn help maintain the authority of the parent over 
the  child."  The  minister  urged  parents  to  "encourage  youth 
leadership  responsibilities  within  the  church,"  and  the  police 
chief  explained  "the  importance  of  teaching  adolescents  their 
proper relationship  to  the law  and  officers  of  the  law." 37 

Political incentives for a  municipal or even a semipublic recre· 
ation  program were also absent.  Not only were  prospective spon· 
sors afraid they would be held  responsible  for  teenage misbehav· 
ior occurring under  their auspices,  but in  1961  not  many  Levit· 
towners  had  adolescent  children  and  not  all  of  them  favored  a 
public program. Middle class parents either had no problems with 
their  youngsters  or  objected  to  the  working  class  advocacy  of 
municipal  recreation,  and  some  working  class  parents  felt  that 
once  children  had  reached  adolescence  they  were  on  their  own. 
The eventual clients of the  program,  the adolescents,  had no po 
litical influence whatsoever. They were too young to vote, and al-
though they might have persuaded their parents to demand facil· 
ities  for  them,  they  probably  suspected  that  what  their  parents 
wanted  for  them  was  more  of what  had  already  been  provided. 
In  the end,  then,  the adults got used  to  the little delinquency 
and  vandalism  that  took  place,  and  the  teenagers  became  sullen 
and unhappy, complaining, "This place in Endsville,"  and wish· 
ing their parents would move back to communities which had fa. 
cilities for them or pressuring them for cars to go to neighboring 
towns. 

The  best  summary  of  what  is  wrong-and  what  should  be 
done-was stated  concisely  by  a  twelfth-grade  essayist:  "I  think 
the adults should spend less  time watching for us to do something 
wrong and  help  us  raise  money  for  a  community center.  We're 
not asking for it, we only want their help." If one begins with the 

The  Vitality  of  Community  Culture 

•  215  • 

assumption that  adolescents  are  rational and  responsible  human 
beings  whose  major  "problem"  is  that  they  have  become  a  dis-
tinctive minority subculture,  it is  not too difficult  to suggest pro-
grams.  What else  the  teenagers want in the way of recreation can 
be readily  inferred  from  their essays:  besides  the center,  a  range 
of  inexpensive  coffeehouses  and  soda  shops  and  other  meeting 
places,  bowling alleys, amusement arcades,  places for dancing, ice 
and  roller  skating  rinks,  garages  for  mechanically  inclined  car 
owners  (all  within walking or bicycling distance or accessible  by 
public  transportation),  and  enough  of  each  so  that  the  various 
age groups and separate cliques have  facilities  they can call  their 
own.  Since  adolescents  are  well  supplied  with  spending  money, 
many  of  these  facilities  can  be  set  up  commercially.  Others 
may  need  public support.  It would,  for  example,  be  possible  to 
provide some municipal subsidies to luncheonette operators who 
are willing to make  their businesses  into  teenage social  centers.88 
Recreational and social facilities are not enough, however.  Part 
of  the  adolescents'  dissatisfaction  with  the  community-as  with 
adult  society  in  general-is  their  functionlessness  outside  of 
school.  American society really has no use for  them other than as 
students,  and condemns  them  to  spend  most  of  their spare  time 
in  recreational  pursuits.  They  are  trying  to  learn  to  be  adults, 
but since  the community and  the larger society want them  to be 
children,  they  learn  adulthood only at school-and there  imper-
fectly.  Yet many tasks  in the community now go unfilled because 
of lack of public funds,  for example, clerical, data-gathering, and 
other functions at city hall; and tutoring children, coaching their 
sports, and leading  their recreational  programs. These are mean-
ingful duties, and I  suspect  many adolescents could fill  them,  ei-
ther  on  a  voluntary  or a  nominal  wage  basis.  Finally,  teenagers 
want  to  learn  to  be  themselves  and do  for  themselves.  It should 
be possible to give  them facilities of their own-or even land on 
which  they  could  build-and  let  them  organize,  construct,  and 
run their own centers and work places. 

Needless  to  say,  such  autonomy  would  come  up  against  the 
very  real  political  difficulties  that  faced  the  more  modest  pro-
grams  suggested  in  Levittown,  and  would  surely  be  rejected  by 
the community.39 The ideal solution, therefore, is to plan for teen-
age  needs  outside  the  local  adult decision-making structure,  and 
perhaps even  outside  the community.  It might  be  possible  to  es-
tablish Teenage Authorities that would play the same interstitial 

•  216  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

role  in  the governmental  structure as  other authorities set up in 
connection  with  intercommunity  and  regional  planning  func-
tions.  Perhaps  the most  feasible  approach  is  to develop  commer-
cially profitable facilities,  to be set up either by teenagers or by a 
private entrepreneur who would need to be less sensitive to polit-
ical  considerations  than  a  public agency.  If and when  the  "juve-
nile  problem"  becomes  more  serious  in  the  suburbs,  federal 
funds  may  become  available  for  facilities  and  for  programs  to 
create jobs,  like those  now being developed  for  urban  teenagers. 
Most  likely,  this  will  only  happen  when  "trouble"  begins  to 
mount.

10.  According to a. story in the October 21,  1957 issue of Long Island's 
Newsday, 27  per cent of the first  18oo  families in Levittown,  New 
York,  were still living there ten years later. 

•  217  • 

11.  Another  10  per cent  left  because  they  were  unhappy  in  the  com-
munity;  7 per cent, for financial reasons;  5 per cent, because of an 
excessive  journey  to  work;  and  4  per cent,  because  of  death,  di· 
vorce, or other changes in the  family.  These figures  were  collected 
from real estate men and people selling their homes privately and 
may not be entirely reliable.  Real estate men may not be  told  the 
real  reasons  for  selling  and  private  sellers  may  have  been  reluc-
tant  to  mention  financial  problems.  However,  only  about  1  per 
cent of the houses were  foreclosed annually. 

12.  In  the  mid-195os,  when  Park  Forest  was  seven  years  old,  annual 
turnover of  homes  was  20  per  cent.  See  Whyte  (1956),  p.  303.  In 
Levittown,  New  York,  a  1961  study  reported  an  average  annual 
rate of about  15  per cent. See  Orzack and Sanders, p.  13.  In Levit-
town, Pennsylvania, the rate varied from 12  to 15  per cent between 
1952  and  1960. See Anderson and Settani. A study  of a  forty-year-
old English  new  town  reported an annual rate of  10  per cent  the 
first  ten years, which has now dropped to 1 per cent. See Willmott 
(1963),  p.  20.  A  study  of  3o,ooo  apartments  in  519  buildings  all 
over the  country,  conducted by  the  Institute of Real  Estate  Man-
agement  and  reported  in  the  New  York  Times  of  November  10, 
1963,  showed  an annual  turnover of  28  per cent,  and  35  per cent 
for garden apartments. 

13.  Eighty-four  per  cent  of  the  Transients  reported  organizational

Sixty-two  per  cent  of  the  Transients  belonged  to  organizations 
other  than  the  church,  compared  to  only  25  per  cent  of  the 
Settlers.

they were less  active  than  before. 

15.  The mean  number of couples  named  by  Transients was  2.75;  by

reading  of  her  data  shows  that  the  strains  of  the  long  and  ardu-
ous climb  required  of an  enlisted  man  in  the  Navy  who  becomes 
an  officer  were  passed  on  to  the  children.  Conversely,  children 
from  middle  class  homes,  whose  fathers  had  graduated  from  An-
napolis,  rarely  suffered  emotionally  from  geographical  mobility. 
Teenagers of both groups suffered  from  moving,  however. 

23.  The question  read:  "Some people have said that communities  like 
Levittown  arc  pretty dull,  without any excitement or interesting 
things  to  do.  How  do  you  feel  about  that?  Do  you  agree  or  dis-
agree?" 

24.  This  respondent  was  describing  the  extremely  active  social  life 
of  the  Jewish  community.  Even  so,  Jews  (particularly  the  better 
educated)  were  more  likely  than  non-Jews  to  agree  that  Levit-
town was dull. Jews also seem to be more interested in city amuse-
ments. 

25.  Cosmopolitan  friends  often  asked  me if I  did not find  Levittown 
dull.  As  a  participant-observer,  I  could  not  answer  the  question, 
for  I  was  immersed  in  community  life  and  strife  and  saw  all  of 
their  vitality  and  excitement.  Even  the  most  routine  event  was 
interesting because  I  was  trying  to  fit  it into an overall  picture of 
the community. As  a  resident,  I  enjoyed being with  Levittowners, 
and  the  proportion  of  dull  ones  was  certainly  no  higher  than  in 
academic  or  any  other circles.  Of course,  Levittown  lacked  some 
of  the  urban  facilities  that  I,  as  a  city-lover,  like  to  patronize.  It 
was not dull, however-but then I  would not make a  public judg-
ment  about  any  community  simply  because  it  could  not  satisfy 
some  of  my  personal  preferences,  particularly  when  the  commu-
nity seemed  to  satisfy  the  preferences of  the  majority of residents 
so  well. 

26.  The students  were  asked  what  they  liked  and  disliked  about  liv-
ing  in  Levittown,  and  what  they  missed  from  their  former  res-
idence.  Since  they  were  not  asked  to  sign  their  names,  and  the 
questions were general, I  believe  the essays  were honest  responses. 
I  purposely included no questions about the schools,  and  teachers 
were instructed not to give any guidance about how the questions 
should  be  answered.  (One  teacher  did  tell  the  children  what  to 
write,  and  these  essays  were  not  analyzed.)  The  data  presented 
here are based on a sample of one sixth- and one eighth-grade class 
from  each  of  the  three  elementary  schools,  and  of  all  tenth- and 
twelfth-grade classes. 

27.  The  data  are  not  strictly  comparable,  for  the  adults  were  asked 
outright whether they liked or disliked living in Levittown, where-
as  the  teenagers'  attitudes  were  inferred  from  the  tone  of  the 
essays.

28.  Twenty-eight per cent of the boys liked the community's newness; 
18  per cent, the friendly people. Among the girls, 34 per cent liked 
the  people;  20  per cent,  Levittown's newness. 

29.  Twenty-five  per  cent of  the  tenth-graders  and  50  per cent  of  the

twelfth-graders say  there is  nothing to do,  and 25  per cent and 46 
per cent,  respectively,  mention  the  lack  of  recreational  facilities. 
Among the  twelfth-grade girls, 56  per cent mention it. 

30.  Similarly  in  the  elementary  schools,  seventh- and  eighth-graders 
complained  about  having  to  go  to  school  with  "immature"  and 
"childish"  students;  when  they  were  moved  to  the  high  school, 
the  older  students  objected  to  their  presence  in  the  same  terms. 
31.  There  was  also  a  dispute  over  programming:  the  adults  wanted 
slow  music  and  the  traditional  dances  they  knew  best;  the  teen-
agers wanted the latest best-selling records  and  the  newest dances. 
They  signed  petitions  for  the  ouster  of  the  man  who  chose  the 
records,  but  the  adults  refused  to  accept  the  petitions,  arguing 
that they would be followed  by  petitions to oust  the school  super-
intendent. 

32.  Indeed,  the  existing  teenage  hangouts  in  little  luncheonettes  re-
sulted from  the lucky accident  that  the  builder and  the  township 
planner  were  unable  to  regulate  and  limit  the  number ·of small 
shopping centers which sprang upon the edge of the community. 
33·  At  one  point  adult-run  dances  failed  to  attract  teenagers,  and  a 
group  of  teenage  leaders  was  delegated  to  run  the  dances  them-
selves.  This foundered  because other teenagers disagreed with the 
rules and program set up by  these  leaders,  and since  only one op-
portunity for  dancing was  provided,  they  could  express  their dis-
agreement only by  nonattendance. 

34·  A  comparison  of  urban  and  suburban  marriages  indicated  that 
extramarital  affairs  occur  principally  in  older and  well-educated 
populations,  and  that'  place  of  residence  is  irrelevant.  Ubell.

tempts,  and  even  drunkenness  and  family  quarrels  among  com-
munity leaders,  I  assume it was  not censored  to  exclude  adultery.

th~ teenagers,  the latter did feel  "bugged."

THE  SUBURBAN  CRITIQUE  CONSIDERS  LIFE  BEYOND  Tf!E  CITY  LIMITS 
h.acrmful  both  to  family life  and  to  the  happiness  and  mental 
health  of  the individual.  The critics  have  argued  that long com-
mutation by the father is helping to create a suburban matriarchy 
with  deleterious  effects  on  the  children,  and  that  homogeneity, 
social  hyperactivity,  and  the absence  of  urban stimuli create de-
pression,  boredom,  loneliness,  and  ultimately,  mental  illness.1 
The findings from Levittown suggest just the opposite-that sub-
urban  life  has  produced  more  family  cohesion  and a  significant 
boost in morale through the reduction of boredom and loneliness. 
Some problems remain, and since  this  study  is  not intended  as  a 
eulogy for suburban living, I  will emphasize  them.  Even so,  most 
Levittowners have adapted positively  to  their new community. 

By  "adaptation,"  I  mean simply how  people respond  to  Levit-
town;  I  use  the  term  neither  normatively  nor  negatively,  but 
descriptively.  I  assume  that people sometimes adjust to  the situa-
tions they face and sometimes react against  them,  but whether or 
not they ought to do either is  up to them.  Similarly,  I  take it for 
granted  that  people  know  when  they  are  bored  and,  if properly 
asked, can report their feelings.  Of course,  they cannot tell  about 
subconscious  maladaptation  and  boredom,  but when  it surfaced 
in  their  answers  or  was  apparent  from  my  observations,  I  have 
reported  it  here.  I  do  not  want,  however,  to  impute  boredom 
simply  because  some  critics'  standards dictate  that  Levittowners 

Family  and  Individual  Adaptation 

•  221 

• 

ought  to  have  been  bored  by  activities  they  actually  enjoyed. 
Finally, 
respondents  may  have  underreported  undesirable 
changes  and  overreported  desirable  ones,  and  the  percentages 
that follow  should  be read  with  this  in  mind.2  Because  women, 
who report undesirable changes more often than men, were over-
represented  in  my  interview  samples,  however,  this  discrepancy 
may cancel  out. 

THE QUALITY OF FAMILY LIFE 

Since people move  to  the suburbs as  families,  it is difficult to sep-
arate individual from family adaptation, and maladaptation often 
affects  people  in  their  family  roles.  Obviously,  many  Levittown-
ers came partly to facilitate family life:  to have more space  in the 
house  and  a  yard  so  that  young  children  could  play  without 
supervision,  while  parents  spent  more  time  with  other  children 
and  adults.  Forty  per  cent  of  the  wives  and  65  per  cent  of  the 
husbands  waru~d to  spend  more  time  with  their  children  in 
Levittown,  and  interestingly  enough,  all  of  the  former  city 
dwellers,  as  compared  to  half  of  the  previous suburbanites  and 
none of the small-towners,  expressed  this  wish.  Evidently,  life  in 
the suburbs deprives parents of time with their children less  than 
that  in  the city.  Because of the charge  that suburbia encourages 
matriarchy,  I  was  curious whether wives  wanted  their  husbands 
to  spend  more  time  with  the  children;  45  per cent did,  but al-
most  the  same  number  wished  to  be  with  their  children  more 
themselves.  Again, former urban wives felt this need most often.3 
Levittown  made  it  possible  for  these  particular  parents  to 
achieve  their wishes,  for  85  per cent of the wives and 71  per cent 
of the husbands wanting more time with the children now had it. 
For the sample as  a  whole, about 40  per cent were with the chil-
dren more frequently,  but the remaining 6o per cent reported no 
change.  And  all  of  the  wives  who  wanted  their  husbands  to  de-
vote themselves more to the children got what they wished.• The 
new house was the cause, for children and adults were around the 
house more, and they often worked together on the yard. 

Moving  to  Levittown  did  not cut  into  the  time  available  for 
family  activities,  for  the  journey  to  work,  often  alleged  to  have 
this  effect,  did not change  significantly.  It changed even  less  for 
former  city  dwellers,  who  previouily  commuted  longer  than 
suburbanites,  than  for  the  random  sample.  The Philadelphians' 

•  222  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

median  trip  increased  from  35  minutes each  way  to  37  after  the 
move,  with  11  per  cent  now  reporting  a  short  trip  (o-19  min-
utes);  47  per cent  a  medium  one  (2o-39  minutes);  31  per cent 
a  long  one  (4o-59  minutes);  and  11  per  cent  a  very  long  one 
(6o  minutes  or  more). 5  Twenty-five  per  cent reported  a  length-
ier commute  than  before,  but  30  per cent a  shorter  one,  and 45 
per cent reported  no  change.  The median  increase  was  30  min-
utes;  the  median decrease,  22. 6  People  with  lengthier commutes 
now  traveled  a  median  45  minutes,  although  33  per cent  had  a 
long trip and 25  per cent a very long one. 7 

Levittowners  did  not  share  the  critics'  and  the  planners'  dis-
taste for commuting.  l\fost said they like or do not mind a trip up 
to  40  minutes;  only a  longer one garnered  a  significant  number 
of dislikes. 8  One third  of the  Philadelphians said  their commute 
was  "wearing," and what made it so was not trip length but mode 
of travel,  two  thirds of those  taking the bus,  37  per cent of those 
driving,  and  only  20  per  cent  of  car  pool  members  reporting 
weariness after their journey.9  Indeed, for some people,  the drive 
to and from  work is  one of the few  moments of total  privacy and 
may  thus be a  relaxing transition  between  the social  demands of 
the  job  and  the  family. 1° Conversely,  the car  pool  is  a  soqial  ex-
perience,  and  in  a  community  like  Levittown,  it  becomes  a 
substitute-on-wheels  for  all  male  social  clubs  and  neighborhood 
taverns.  It is  thus  no  surprise  that  even  car  pool  trips  of  more 
than  40  minutes  were  not  found  wearing.  Indeed,  women  seem 
to  be more affected  by  their husbands'  journey to work than the 
men themselves,  partly because the men cannot be with  the chil-
dren  during  the  preparation  of dinner and  perhaps  because  the 
men  take  the strain of a· long trip out on their wives.11 

Commutation  played  a  minor  role  in, the  parental  time  bud-
get,  however.  Two  thirds  of the  men  with  short 'work  trips  had 
more  time  for  the  children,  while  those  with  longer  trips  were 
unaffected,  and wives  reported  that men with  trips over 40  min-
utes  had  more  time  with  their  children  than  those  with  shorter 
ones.  Actually,  longer  hours  on  the  job  (often  required  by  the 
promotion which  financed  the purchase of the new house)  was  a 
more significant factor in preventing the 29  per cent of husbands 
who wanted more  time with  their children  from  finding  it. 

Fifty-seven per cent of the husbands-mainly the younger ones 
-sought more time with their wives and all  but one got it.  Only 
37  per cent of the wives wanted to be with their husbands more, 

Family  and  Individual  Adaptation 

•  223  • 

but all  got  their wish.  Age  made  no  difference,  but once  again, 
the  former city  residents  felt  a  greater need  for  more  time  with 
their  men.  In  the random  sample as  a  whole,  about  40  per cent 
said  they  had  more  time  with  each  other  in  Levittown. 12  Short 
work  trips seem  to give  spouses  more  time  with  each  other,  but 
long ones do not deprive them of time, for there was no statistical 
association  between  people  who  reported  long  trips  and  those 
who reported less time with their spouses. 13 

Levittown  also  provided  more  opportunity  for  parents  and 
children to do things together;  nearly half the random sample re-
spondents  reported increased  joint family  activity 14  in  both  the 
first  and  second  interviews. 15  In  the  first  interview,  72  per  cent 
explained  that  fixing  up  the  house  and  the  yard  were  responsi-
ble;  by the second,  40  per cent pointed to new social  and recrea-
tional  opportunities.  When children were  old  enough  to  join  in 
shopping,  recreation,  and  visiting,  joint  family  activity  rose; 
when  they  became  old enough  to  prefer  peers,  it decreased,  and 
as  the effects of the house and community wear off, age is likely to 
be  the more important determinant of family  cohesion. 

Because the random sample had interpreted joint family activ-
ity as  referring to  parents and  children,  the  Philadelphians were 
asked,  "Do  you  and  your  husband  do  more  things  together  in 
Levittown  than  where  you  lived  before,  or  fewer  things?"  Al-
though 40 per cent reported more "joint couple activity,"  20 per 
cent  mentioned  a  decrease.  House  and  community activities  are 
again  significant  reasons  for  the  increase,  while  the reduction  is 
explained  by  age.  Newlyweds  find  children  distracting  to  their 
own relationship--fully 55  per cent of couples under twenty-five 
report a  decrease  in joint activity in  Levittown. And when older 
children join their peers, a cleavage is  created between  their par-
ents.  Husbands who are now working longer hours and traveling 
longer to work also mention  fewer shared activities, as  do profes-
sionals, the well educated, and Jews. 

Levittown seemed to have no effect on marital happiness,  how-
ever.  Only  about  20  per  cent  reported  an  improvement  in  the 
marital  relationship; 16  as  might be expected,  few  were  ready  to 
admit a  poorer marriage, and most just indicated it had remained 
about  the  same.  Older  couples  reported  the  least  change,  and 
among  the  Philadelphians,  low-status  ones  the  most  deteriora-
tion, but otherwise dass differences were negligible. The happier 
couples  credited  the  house,  particularly  additional  space  which 

•  224  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

reduced  :;etting in each other's way,  and home ownership, which 
encouraged  "maturity,"  reduced  petty  bickering,  and  increased 
contentment.  One woman  pointed  out,  "The house  keeps  me  so 
busy,  I  don't  have  time  to  nag him,  but  I'm more  content  here 
too."  But the  initial  lift to  the marital  relationship produced by 
the  house  and  ownership  lasted  only  until  the  novelty  wore  off. 
Indeed,  in  the second  interview,  the woman just quoted said  the 
marriage  had  returned  to  the  status quo before  Levittown:  "He 
has  become so  wrapped  up in community activities and his work 
that he  has  forgotten  his  family."  Commuting seems  to influence 
the marital relationship,  particularly for wives;  both joint couple 
activity  and  marital  happiness  are  affected  negatively  when  the 
wives  consider  their  husband's  commute  wearing.  The  men  do 
not  agree,  however,  getting along with  their wives  as  well  when 
the trip is wearing as  when it is not. 

Thus  the  interviews  suggest  that  the  suburban  critique  is 
wrong;  family  life  has  changed  relatively  little  for  the  majority, 
and  the  changes  are  mainly  improvements.  These  data,  the 
minimal  impact of the journey to work, and my observations also 
cast  doubt  on  the  fear  of  an  incipient  suburban  matriarchy.  Al-
though  Philadelphians  had  had  a  sizeable  journey  to work  even 
when  they  lived  in  the  city  and studies of urban  neighborhoods 
indicate that men are away  from  the house during working hours 
as  much  as  in  Levittown,  no critic has  yet  begun  to worry about 
urban  matriarchy.  Among  middle  class  families  in  Levittown, 
some  household roles  that were once  the  woman's monopoly are 
now shared,  but among the working class families, suburban hus-
bands were as  reluctant  to wash  the dishes  or look after the chil-
dren  as  they  had  been  in  the  city.  In  some  cases,  they  even  left 
lawn-mowing  to  the  women,  or  tried  to,  but  were  quickly  dis-
couraged by block social pressure. 

Much  of  the  popular  talk  about  an  emerging  matriarchy 
strikes  me  as  a  misreading  of  the  trend  toward  greater  equality 
between  the  sexes-a  middle  class  value  which  is  also  being 
adopted by many working class women these days-and the devel-
opment  of  more  shared  interests,  owing  to  increased  (and  in-
creasingly coeducational)  schooling for  women.  Yet  even  among 
highly  educated  Levittowners,  the  husbands  still  made  the deci-
sions,  and women still  threatened errant children with  "wait till 
your  father  comes  home."  There  were  some  domineering wives 
and henpecked husbands,  but they were considered as  deviant in 
Levittown  as  elsewhere.  Public  concern  about  matriarchy  is 

Family  and  Individual  Adaptation 

•  225  • 

natural-at  least  among  men,  for  they  are  undoubtedly  losing 
some of the  power they  held  in the  past,  and  those who  must re-
linquish power usually phrase their complaints as social criticism. 
Family life  in  Levittown also  impressed me as  being no differ-
ent  from  that  in  other communities.  A  few  marriages  were  very 
happy,  and  a  few  very  unhappyY  The  latter  were  of  course 
more  visible;  during  my  three  years  of  research,  14  suicide  at-
tempts  took  place,  all  but  one  by  women  and  only  one  success-
ful.18  In  most  instances,  women  took  sleeping  pills  and  then 
called  the  police,  their  doctor,  or  their  minister  immediately, 
reversing  what  was  surely  an  impulsive  and  pathetic  cry  for  at-
tention.  Two  women  accounted  for  four  of  the  unsuccessful  at-
tempts.  About a  hundred  cases  of serious  domestic conflict made 
the  police  blotter,  usually  when  a  wife  called  for  protection 
against  a  violent  husband.  Seventy  families  contributed  to  this 
figure,  but  15  accounted  for  fully  half  of  it,  and  55  called  the 
police  only  once.  Conflicts  on  record  were  usually  among  work-
ing class families,  for  the middle class  uses  techniques of fighting 
that are not noisy or violent enough to merit official  intervention. 
Conversely,  I  suspect that the suicide attempts were more often a 
middle  class  method  of  coping  with  an  unhappy  marriage,  and 
the one woman who killed  herself left a  tragic  note to  this effect. 
These are extreme situations,  however.  Another assessment  of 
marital  life comes  from  a  survey  taken  in  1961  among a  random 
sample  of  100  Levittowners  regarding  a  family  service  agency. 
TweRty-six per cent said one was needed, 51  per cent were sure it 
was  not, and 23  per cent were uncertain. If one assumes  that peo-
ple  were  really  talking  about  their  own  marriages,  a  quarter 
expressed  the  desire  for  help.  Undoubtedly class  enters  the  pic-
ture;  one would  not expect working class  families  to resort  to an 
agency.  On  the  other  hand,  young  middle  class  families  might 
seek  an  agency  without  being desperate.  Survey  data  tell  little 
about  married  life  in  Levittown,  however,  and  observation  sug-
gests that the majority of marriages combine that mixture of bliss 
and bickering to be found everywhere.

PATTERNS  OF  INDIVIDUAL  ADAPTATION:  SUBURBAN 
HAPPINESS  AND  FEMALE  MALAISE 

The literature of suburban criticism  abounds with references  to 
auburban malaise and anomie, but however colorful,  these  terms 
are not quite accurate.  In fact,  it would be more correct to speak 

•  226  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

of  suburban  happiness,  for  most  Levittowners  experienced  less 
depression,  boredom,  and  loneliness  after  the  move.  Even  so,  a 
minority, sometimes  up  to  a  third,  report  the  opposite,  particu-
larly  among  the  Philadelphians.  Occasionally  these  feelings  stem 
from  being  isolated  in  the  community,  but  usually  they  reflect 
more  general  problems  of  working  and  lower  middle  class 
women in contemporary society.  If there is  malaise in Levittown, 
it is female but not suburban. 

Morale  and Health 

Thirty-six  per cent  of  the  random  sample  spoke  of  improved 
morale  after  coming  to  Levittown  and  all  but 6  per cent  of  the 
remainder  reported  no  change. 19  Among  the  Philadelphians, 
however,  only  22  per cent· reported  a  better disposition,  and  31 
per cent  a  poorer  one  (among  the women,  the  percentages  were 
19  and  38)--one of  the  few  instances  in which  change  was  more 
negative  than positive.20  High- and low-status  urbanites and peo-
ple  under  twenty-five  were  unhappier  now,  and  only  those  over 
forty-five  raised  their morale significantly. 21  In both samples,  the 
improvement in morale could be traced mainly to  the new house 
and  yard,  and  the  greater  ease  in rearing  children,  producing  a 
feeling  most  often  described  as  "relaxation."  A  Philadelphian 
said, "In the city, I'd have all  that tension  being out with my son. 
Here I can let him go,  and if I want to do something I  can putter 
in  the  garden.  It  is  so  quiet  and  serene  here,  it just  makes  you 
relax." 

The  people  with  poorer  dispositions  fall  into  four  types. 
Young women who have  become  mothers  in  Levittown,  particu-
larly  those  who  worked  before,  find  it  difficult  to  be  full-time 
housekeepers  and  to  cope  with  the  children,  and  this  is  com-
pounded  by  the feeling  of being "stuck."  Without a  car or com-
patible neighbors,  there  is  no  respite  or  escape. 

A  second  group,  primarily working  class  women,  miss ~family 
and  friends  in  the  city  and  find  it  difficult  to  cut  their  ties  to 
them.  Among  the  random  sample,  more  neighbor  and  couple 
visiting  results  in  better  morale,  but  among  unhappy  Philadel-
phians it does not help, even for  women  who  have  found  a  close 
friend  in  Levittown.  The  problem  is  summed  up  well  by  one 
young working class  ex-Philadelphian:  "It's too quiet here, noth-
ing to do.  In the city you  can go downtown shopping, see  all  the 
people,  or  go  visit  mother.  If there  were  more  friendly  people 

Family  and  Individual  Adaptation 

•  227  • 

here  it  would  be  better.  I  knew  more  people  the  first  year,  but 
also  I  didn't  have  any  kids-I  was  only  carrying  the  first-so  I 
could  go  downtown  and  see  mother,  and  the  days  would  go  by 
fast." 

Third, some Jewish  women, either more or less  educated than 
the  majority  or with  non-Jewish  husbands,  were  now  more  un-
happy.  One,  a  working class  woman  married  to  a  Catholic,  said, 
"Here  you  meet  people  only  through  organizations,  churches, 
and  clubs,  but we  are  not  organizational  types  and  I  don't care 
for  organizational  life."  A  better-educated  one  had  the  opposite 
problem:  ''I'd feel  better if  I  could  make  friends  with  people,  if 
the  women  here  were  more  sincere.  A  lot  of  them  here  like  to 
play cards and I don't, and there are a lot of gossip-mongers and I 
don't  believe  in  that.  Several  organizations are  bothering you  to 
join,  a  constant  annoyance  of  activities,  and  if  you  don't  join, 
they say you are a grouch, you lack community spirit." 

Last,  women  with  poor  marriages  and  with  husbands  on  the 
road or with long commutes suffer from  poorer morale, although 
their prime reaction  is  loneliness. 22  One woman pointed  out, "1£ 
you are alone here, you are alone.  In an apartment, you can walk 
out  the  door.  It's  OK  though,  when  my  husband  is  home.  But 
when he's not, then I feel  isolated." 

Changes  in  physical  health  were  minor,  and  reflected  those  in 
morale.  Eighteen  per cent of the random sample reported better 
health;  the  same  proportion,  poorer  health.  Among  the  Phila-
delphians,  the  percentages  were  9  and  17,  respectively. 28  The 
healthier people said  they were  now  less  tense,  the  more relaxed 
way  of  living  having  alleviated  colds  and  allergies.  For  random 
sample respondents, more sickness was usually a recurrence of old 
ailments,  but  the  Philadelphians  reported  new  complaints, 
mainly  colds,  allergies,  nervous  tension,  and  increased  weight. 
Their illnesses  were  probably emotionally caused;  half in  poorer 
health  also  reported  poorer  morale,  but  in  the  random  sample, 
even  sicker  people  had  improved  dispositions. 24  High- and  low-
status  Philadelphians  and  the  ')ery  young  felt  their  health  had 
deteriorated  most;  the  older  people,  that  it  had  improved  the 
most-the  same  groups  who  also  reported  poorer  and  better 
morale.  Some  Philadelphians,  especially  men,  said  they  became 
sick  over  financial  worries;  for  others,  particularly  lower-status 
and Jewish respondents,  loneliness and distaste for  suburban liv-
ing were involved.

Boredom 

THE  LEVITTOWNEBS 

The amount  of  boredom  in  Levittown  is  shown  in  Table  5· 
Although people may underreport,  40  per cent (about a  third of 
the  women  and  more  than  half  the  men)  are  never  bored  and 
only a  few  women  are  constantly so.  Boredom  does  not seem  to 
be a  serious  problem in Levittown.  Younger  people  experienced 
somewhat  more  boredom  than  older ones,  but  there was  no  pat-
tern  by  class. 26  Since  former  city  dwellers  reported  as  much 
boredom in their prior residence as  suburban ones,  the common 
idea  that  suburbanites  are  more  bored  than  city  dwellers  is  in-
accurate.

•  People were asked, "'We all get bored every so  often.  How often  do you  find 
yourself feeling  bored, having nothing to do,  or nothing you  want  to  do espe-
cially?  Do  you  feel  this  way:  almost  every  day,  a  few  times  a  month,  about 
once a month, or less often  t11an  that?" The never category was  not read  to  the 
respondents. 

About  a  third  of  the  bored  women  attributed  it  to  the 
menstrual  period,  poor health,  or a  periodic bad mood.  But two 
other  reasons  are  mentioned  more  often:  housework  and  being 
"stuck."  Some  women  complain  about  the  monotony  of  house-
work,  especially ironing, yet what  invites boredom most often is 
simply  "doing  the  same  thing  over  and  over  again."  This reac-

Family  and  Individual  Adaptation 

•  229  • 

tion  is  voiced  by women  impatient with  being only  housewives, 
but not yet able to see  themselves  in other roles,  for example,  in 
voluntary associations. 

The move  to Levittown  has  improved matters,  principally for 
the  random  sample,  for  51  per cent said  their  boredom  had  de-
creased  or disappeared,  33  per cent  reported  no  change,  and  16 
per cent,  that  it  had  increased  or  appeared  for  the  first  time. 26 
Among the Philadelphians,  51  per cent report no change;  27  per 
cent  (a  third  of  the  women)  report  an  increase;  22  per  cent,  a 
reduction.27 

The  reduction  in  boredom  is  explained  by  the  activities 
around  the  house  and  yard  and  the  increased  social  life.  Inter-
estingly enough,  the  house's  impact  on  boredom does  not disap-
pear  even  after  its  novelty  has  worn  off.  Joint  family  activity 
drops off,  but the house offers diversion even after three years.  As 
one  person  put  it,  "Ymt  start  trimming  the  lawn  or  pull  one 
weed, and then you go on to do the job right because you want it 
to  look  right,  and  the  time goes.  There's less  time  to  be  bored." 
Increased  boredom  was  concentrated  largely  in  the  Philadel-
phia  sample,  with  people  of  low  status,  those  under  twenty-five 
and  over  forty-five,  and  Jews  reporting  considerably  higher  in-
creases  and  smaller  decreases  than  others.  For  example,  70  per 
cent  without a  high  school diploma  felt  more  boredom,  as  com-
pared  to  20  per cent of  the college-educated.  There  is  little  pat-
tern  to  the increase.  Sometimes it is  caused  by  being kept in the 
house  by  weather  or children's  illnesses;  sometimes  it  is  a  more 
permanent  feeling  of  isolation,  either  because  there  is  not 
enough  housework  or  because  the  role  change  from  worker  to 
mother  has  proved  restrictive  and  less  interesting.  The  major 
complaint,  however,  was  "nothing  to  do."  Philadelphians  who 
find  Levittown dull report boredom more often, as  do those who 
do  not  belong  to  organizations  or  who  are  less  active  than  they 
had  been  in  the city.  Born-and-bred  city  people  are  bored  more 
than  those  who  moved  to  Philadelphia  in adulthood,  and so  are 
people who lived  wit~ their  parents  or  in-laws  or  miss  relatives 
and close friends.  Those who became organizationally active and 
some  who  increased  their  visiting  were  less  likely  to  become 
bored;  for  others  new friends  do not seem  to  be enough,  people 
who  felt  close  to  someone  in  Levittown  reporting  as  much  in-
crease  in  boredom  as  those  who  had  not  found  anyone. 28  Their 
problem  is  mainly  separation  from  their  Philadelphia  compan-

•  280  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

ions,  but also  the  loss  of what  one  might  call  the  "urban safety 
valve." As  one Philadelphian pointed out, "In the city I  was  able 
to go into town every once in a  while,  but here I  can't. I  get rest-
less  at  times,  fed  up.  Then  I  need  a  change,  have  to  get  out. 
Being with the kids all  the time builds up tension and you get rid 
of  it  by  going  out  and  away  from  them."  Of  course,  this  was 
accentuated  by  the  shortage  of  shopping  and  window-shopping 
facilities in Levittown at the time of the interviewing. 

If life  in  Levittown  really  produced  boredom,  one  would  ex-
pect an  increase  over  time,  but most  respondents  who  had  been 
bored when they first  came to Levittown reported a decrease two 
years  later,  and  only 5  and  8  per cent  in  the  two  samples  an  in-
crease. Of the Philadelphians initially not bored, however, 73  per 
cent say  they are now bored. They found Levittown very exciting 
at the start but now Jack activities and friends to keep them  busy. 
Once  the  novelty  wore  off,  they  became  disenchanted.  Two 
thirds of these women had been bored in  Philadelphia, however, 
and  the  early  months  in  Levittown  were  only  a  temporary 
respite. The move initiated boredom for  the remaining third and 
for  17  per  cent  of  the  men.  The  trend  to  less  boredom  with 
length  of  residence  is  supported  by a  study in  Levittown,  Penn-
sylvania.  Fifty-four  per  cent  with  two  years'  residence  were 
bored,  but  only  29  per  cent  with  four,  and  22  per  cent  with 
seven.  Of course,  the really  bored may  have  left  the community, 
but of those who stayed, only  18  per cent say they are bored more 
often now than when they first arrived.29 

Loneliness 

Loneliness  is  as  rare  in  Levittown  as  boredom.30  Table  6 
shows  that  only  about  20  per  cent  of  the  women  are  lonely  at 
least  a  few  times  a  month,  and  taking  underreporting  into  ac-
count, these can be thought "really lonely." Loneliness is  roughly 
similar in amount to  boredom, and the  two also overlap, mainly 
because  being  stuck  in  the  house  can  produce  both  feelings. 31 
Unlike  boredom,  however,  loneliness  strikes  all  kinds  of  Levit-
towners and does not vary with age,  class,  religion, or other char-
acteristics.  For example,  20 per cent of blue collar Philadelphians 
reported being lonely at least a  few  times a  month, but so  did 25 
per cent of professional ones.32 

The reason  for  this  unexpected finding  is  that  there are  three 
types  of  loneliness:  social,  which  develops  from  lack  of  friends; 

•  231  • 

Family  and  Individual  Adaptation 
familial,  which,  at  least  in  Levittown,  is  felt  by  women  cut  off 
from  their  parents  and,  more  important,  from  husbands  whose 
jobs  require  traveling,  long  hours,  or  such  preoccupation  with 
work  that  they  have  little  time  for  their  wives;  and  chronic,  a 
personal alienation above and beyond social  and familial  causes. 
The  three  types  can  strike  the  same  person;  indeed,  when 
familial  loneliness  is  not  compensated  for  by  social  life,  it may 
lead to the chronic variety.

•  Respondents  were  asked,  "In  a  new  community,  people  sometimes 
feel  lonely.  How  often  would  you  say  you  feel  lonely  here?"  All  cate· 
gories  with  the  exception  of  never  were  read  to  them. 

tIn  the  first  interview,  the  random  sample  respondents  were  asked 
only  if  tJ+ey  were  lonely  or  not.  Nineteen  per  cent  said  they  were 
lonely. 

· 

Of the  small  number of really  lonely in  both samples,  38  per 
cent  gave  reasons  which  suggested  social  loneliness  and  54  per 
cent,  familial.  As  might  be  expected,  no  one  admitted  chronic 
loneliness,  but  I  would guess  that not more  than  10  per cent of 
Levittown's women were in this condition.88  Fifty-seven per cent 
of  Philadelphians  who  had  lived  with  parents ·or in-laws  report

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

being really lonely in Levittown; so do half the wives of salesmen 
and pilots, but only  12  per cent of those married to office and fac-
tory  workers. 8o~  Since  67  per  cent  of  wives  with  traveling  hus· 
bands and  only  35  per cent of the  others were  lonely  before  the 
move,  and  since  loneliness  does  not  vary  with  length  of  trip  to 
work, occupational absence  is  clearly at fault.  (I  should note that 
not all  salesmen  were  travelers,  and  more  subtle  psychodynamic 
factors  may  be  at  play  in  salesmen's  marriages.)  Improved social 
life  does  not reduce  this  type  of  familial  loneliness,  for  the  pro-
portion  lonely  is  as  high  among  those  visiting  more  as  among 
those visiting less. 

Almost  half  the  random  sample and  22  per  cent of the  Phila-
delphians  had  been  lonely  in  their  former  residence,  and  most 
seemed  to  have  suffered  from  social  loneliness.  Levittown was  a 
godsend for  them, for 70 per cent of the former and all of the lat-
ter  reported  less  loneliness  after  the  move.  One  Philadelphian 
said, "In the city,  if I  was alone,  I  stayed  home.  Here a  neighbor 
comes  over  to  talk.  In  the  city,  everyone  worked  and  people 
didn't  come  out and  talk."  In  other  instances,  husbands  are no 
longer  away  so  much,  or  work  shorter  hours.  For  the  random 
sample as  a  whole,  about a  third reported  that loneliness had set 
in or increased,  a  third  that it had decreased  or disappeared, and 
a  third  that  nothing  had  changed.  Among  the  Philadelphians, 
however,  only  22  per cent reported less,  and 43  per cent more.36 
The women  in  the  random  sample  are  not  seriously  bothered; 
none are  really lonely,  but in  the  Philadelphia group  more than 
half are, most of them with  familial loneliness.  Some  who  report 
being lonely in  Levittown for  the first  time are Jews who do not 
fit  into  the  Jewish  subcommunity,  being  more  or  less  educated 
than their peers or married to non-Jews. Most of the newly lonely 
are,  however,  low-status  people  (of  all  religions)  who  not  only 
miss  their families  in Philadelphia but also  have  trouble finding 
friends in Levittown. Even so, judging from  the reasons given for 
changes in loneliness, the husband's absence and separation from 
relatives  are  more  frequent  causes  of  loneliness  than  is  social 
isolation. 

Because  so  much  loneliness  is  familial,  it  does  not  decrease 
with length of residence and, in fact,  only becomes apparent after 
some  time  in  Levittown.  For example,  of those  not lonely  after 
six months  in  Levittown,  18  per cent of the random sample and 
55 per cent of the Philadelphia sample were lonely by the second 

Family  and  Individual  Adaptation 

interview. Some had been seeing their families in the city or were 
busy  venturing  into  new  relationships  in  Levittown  at  first. 
Others  were  Jewish  women,  initially  quite  active,  who  realized 
after the organizational tasks  had been taken care of and sociabil-
ity  became  more  important  that  they  did  not  share  prevailing 
group  interests.  Conversely,  those  whose  initial  loneliness  was 
due to lack of social  life reported that it had been dispelled after 
two years in the community.as 

Because  so  many  lonely  Philadelphians  mentioned  missing 
people  from  the  city,  this  sample  was  asked  an  additional  ques-
tion  about  it.37  Altogether,  68  per cent  of  the  women  and  half 
the  men  had  "close  family"  in  Philadelphia,  particularly  the 
wives of blue collar workers,  Catholics,  Italians, Jews,  and previ-
ous  homeowners.  Two  thirds  saw  these  relatives  less  often  since 
they  had  moved;  15  per cent  saw  them  more, especially recently 
married women  who needed  their mothers once  they  themselves 
had children.  Of those who visit  family  less  often,  35  per cent of 
the women,  but none of  the  men,  feel  badly about  it.  (Whether 
or not they visit, none of the men, but 53  per cent of the women, 
miss  someone  in  the  city-mainly,  of course,  their  families.  Al-
though low-status wives do so  most often,  higher ones are not far 
behind.88)  Religion  and  ethnic  background  make  no difference, 
but  So  per  cent  of  the  women  under  twenty-five  and  the  same 
proportion of mixed  marriage  partners say  they  miss  their  fami-
lies. 

Over  time,  the  physical  distance  from  the  family  becomes  an 
emotional  one,  at  least  for  some,  46  per  cent  missing  their 
families  less  after  two  years  in  Levittown.89  Eighty-five  per cent 
of  these  women  have  met someone  else  to  whom  they  feel  close, 
72  per cent  having found  neighbors  and  the  rest  friends.  These 
"family substitutes" do not decrease  loneliness for,  in  this group, 
people  who &fill  miss  their  families  are  lonelier  than  those  who 
do  not,  but only  occasiqnally  so,  about  once  a  month. 40  Just  25 
per cent of the women who miss their mothers or parents want to 
move closer to them, but to other suburbs, and none wants tore-
turn  to  the  city  just  to  be  near  them.  Undoubtedly,  the  unani-
mous  failure  of  husbands  to  miss  their  relatives  or  in-laws  is 
partly responsible. 

My definition of real  loneliness (a  few  times a  month or more) 
may be exaggerated, and the resulting data may overestimate the 
extent  of  traumatic  aloneness.  In  any  case,  they  hardly  demon-

•  234  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

strate the alienation which the critics ascribe to suburbia. Indeed, 
suburbia clearly reduces alienation,  its abundant  social  life  even 
ameliorating  the  pains  of  chronic  and  familial  loneliness.  But 
there  is  also  that  third  of  the  population  for  whom  one woman 
spoke  when  she  said,  ''I'd  never  feel  lonely  no  matter  where  I 
was.  There are  always  nice  people  close  by whom  you  can  visit. 
And then there's the TV and radio. And besides,  I'm always busy 
and never have  time  to  be  lonely."  It may be  that cosmopolitans 
project  the  alienation  they  experience  in  American  society  onto 
suburbanites. 

Problems  and  W o"ies 

Another way of shedding light on family and individual  adap-
tation  in  Levittown  is  through  the  problems  raised  and  elimi-
nated  by  the  move.  The  random  sample  was  asked  to  describe 
new  and  old  problems;  since  some  respondents  seemed  hesitant 
to  talk  about  them,  the  interview  schedule  for  former  Philadel-
phians  added  a  question  about  old  and  new  worries,  which 
elicited  a  better  response. 41  Problems  and  worries  are  universal, 
about  6o  per  cent  reporting  the  former  and  93  per cent  the  lat-
ter.  Because  of  the  stigma  attached  to  problems,  the  proportion 
of worries is  probably more accurate. As  expected, low-status peo-
ple reported more problems than  higher-~tatus ones,  although all 
classes worried in equal  numbers. About 70 per cent of the prob-
lems  and  62  per  cent  of  the  worries  could  be  related  to  Levit-
town.  The  principal  irritant  was  family  finances,  second  was 
child-rearing, and third was illness. 42 

Seventy-two  per  cent  of  the  Philadelphians  and  half  the  ran-
dom  sample  suggested  finances  as  the  major  trouble  spot,  with 
furnishings,  heat bills,  and  the added wear and tear on  the auto-
mobile  mentioned  as  specifics.  Worries about  taxes were voiced 
also,  but less  often.  Obviously,  low-status and low-income  people 
(earning  under  $65oo)  worried  most  over  finances,  but  high-
income  ones  (earning  over  $gooo)  reported  financial  problems 
as often as  the rest-they just did not worry so much about them. 
Families  whose  income  decreased  or  remained  stable  after  the 
move worried too,  regardless of how much they earned, and poor 
Levittowners  in  large  numbers  said  they  had  not  had  financial 
worries  before  the  move. 43  Budgetary  troubles  create  other 
problems,  particularly  marital  ones.  As  one  blue collar  wife  ex-
plained,  "It's  money  that  causes  all  the  other  problems.  When 

Family  and  Individual  Adaptation 

my  husband  and  I  quarrel,  it's  because  of  not  being  able  to  do 
things  and  have  things."  For  most  Levittowners,  however,  in-
creases in the cost of living created inconveniences and occasional 
arguments  rather  than  serious difficulties.  One comment is  typi-
cal:  "Living around here is  a  little higher than we  expected, and 
we don't have quite so much money to flash  around." 

Children,  too,  cause  problems  and  worries,  mostly  over  disci-
pli)le  and  school  performance.  Of  fourteen  discipline  problems 
reported  in  the  interviews,  half  could  clearly  be  traced  and,  of 
these, five  to  Levittown. They stem from  the attempt to maintain 
standards  in  the  face  of different  ones  among neighbors.  As  one 
mother put it,  "In a  community like  this,  they  have  lots  of chil-
dren who run wild,  stay up late at night. When I  caii  my daugh-
ter home to bed or supper, she does not want to come because her 
friends  are  out late."  Middle class  families  with  discipline  prob-
lems  complain  about  bad  influences  from  neighbors;  working 
class ones,  that their children· become "smart-alecks" as  they grow 
up.  Two Jewish  respondents  reported  difficulties  resulting  from 
the  pace  of  Jewish  life.  "The  children  are  oversocialized  here, 
and there are discipline problems-this is  new to Levittown," one 
said.  The other said,  "It takes  more time to raise children. They 
belong  to  more  clubs  and  we  have  to  take  them  from  place  to 
place."  School  problems  result  mainly  from  changing  schools, 
especiaiiy  when  a  child  moves  from  a  city  parochial  school  to a 
more permissive  public school.  Parental roles  have an  impact on 
the child as  well.  In  the case  of a  sociaiiy  isolated  Jewish  family, 
the  child seems  to  be lonely  too,  which  in  turn affects  his school 
performance.  Of  the  seven  school  problems  reported,  however, 
only two have developed since the move. 

Illness  is  mentioned third,  but ail  cases  were carryovers,  not a 
result  of  the  move,  as  were  three  cases  of  emotional  difficulties. 
The  two  cases  of  marital  difficulty  also  existed  prior  to  Levit-
town,  but  one  marriage  broke  up after  previous  economic  trou-
bles  were augmented  by  the  move.  Some  respondents  were  con-
cerned ab041t  job problems, and ex-servicemen or Transients who 
wanted  to  stay  in the community worried about finding work  in 
the area. 

While Levittown created new problems and worries,  it also re-
duced or eliminated some old ones. For about a third of the peo-
ple  in  each  sample,  old  problems -and  worries  disappeared  or 
were  tamed, while only  7  per cent of the random sample and  17 

•  236  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

per  cent  of  the  Philadelphians  reported  that  old  problems  had 
been  exacerbated.  The  latter  difficulties  were  financial,  where<~s 
improvements were  primarily in health and family  relationships. 
One  respondent  claimed  that  his  children's  asthma  had  "im-
proved  go  per  cent."  Better  family  relationships  were  credited 
largely  to  the  increased  space  in  the house.  One mother  pointed 
out,  "We were  terribly crowded;  now  I  don't  have  to  sit on  the 
boys anymore." Another woman said, "I was a golf widow before. 
My husband hasn't lost interest in golf,  but there are other things 
to  do.  We  used  to  argue  a  lot.  Now he  works  around  the  house 
and  we  don't argue."  Philadelphians  felt  they  had  escaped  from 
undesirable conditions in the city.  One mother summarized it, "I 
worry Jess  about the traffic, and kids running in the street. I don't 
fear  that the kids will  be picked up by strangers any more;  there 
is  better  police  protection  here."  Others  were  relieved  of  traffic 
noises, dirt, and living next to factories. 

Emotional  Disturbance  and  Mental  IllneBB 

Suburbia  is  purported  to  breed  mental  illness,  but  relevant 
data are hard to come by, especially  in a  new community without 
a  hospital  or  a  local  psychiatrist."  Although  I  talked  regularly 
with  doctors  and  ministers  about the  number of  nervous  break-
downs  and  people  referred  to  psychiatrists,  checked  police  rec-
ords  for  instances  of  repeated  marital  conflict  and  suicide  at-
tempts,  and  tried  to  learn  prior  histories,  most  of  the  resulting 
data are only estimates.  During the first  two years of Levittown's 
existence, while 3000 families were arriving,  I counted  14 suicide 
attempts,  15  families  who  appeared  more  than  once  before  the 
police  on  domestic  conflict  charges,  an  estimated  50  nervous 
breakdowns,  an  estimated  100  psychiatric  referrals  by  doctors,  a 
similar  number  of  cases  of  pastoral  counseling  judged  by  the 
ministers  to  involve  "serious"  problems,  and  an  estimated  50 
juvenile  delinquents  in  repeated  difficulties  with  the  police  or 
the school.  Comparisons to other communities are impossible be-
cause  of  the  nature  of  the  data  and  because  of  the  difficulty  of 
computing rates in a  town just being occupied, but the figures  do 
not  seem  alarming.  I  would  judge  there  is  no  more  mental  ill-
ness, at least of the kind that surfaces into statistics,  in Levittown 
than  in other communities, and certainly less  than in the cities." 
More  important,  of  16  case  histories  gathered  from  doctors, 
ministers,  and  the  police,  13  indicated  similar  emotional  dis-

Family  and  Individual  Adaptation 

turbances in former residences, and  in no case was  there any evi-
dence  that  the  problem  had developed  in or worsened  in  Levit-
town.  Indeed, most of these  people had come with the hope  that 
a  change of scenery might resolve  their emotional  problems.  For 
example,  two  women, one married to an alcoholic,  the other to a 
compulsive gambler,  persuaded their husbands  to move  to  Levit-
town,  but once  the novelty of the house and  of home  ownership 
wore off,  the old problems returned, and eventually both families 
moved out.  Needless  to say,  emotional  problems  resolved  by  the 
move  did  not  c.;ome  to  public  attention,  but  I  doubt  that  the 
move  could  have  solved  serious  disturbances.  Conversely,  it 
could-and did-alleviate emotional  problems created  by social 
isolation in the previous residence. 

Almost  all  emotional  difficulties  that came  to  light were  expe-
rienced  by  women,  and  among  these,  two  faxniliar  types  stand 
out:  the  working class  woman  cut off  from  her  parents  and  the 
wife whose  husband is  occupationally on  the road.  Among them, 
the ones who are also socially isolated  tend  to express  their emo-
tional  problems  visibly  and  publicly.  Nevertheless,  in  most  in-
stances  marital  conflict  is  also  present,  and  indeed,  the  women 
most  beset  by  breakdowns,  even  the wives  of salesmen, are  those 
with unhappy marriages.  A  happy marriage does  not assure  emo-
tional  equilibrium and marital difficulties are not necessarily the 
cause  of  the  trouble,  but  individual  problems  often  vent  them-
selves  in  marital  tension.  Nor does  the  preponderance  of female 
cases  mean  that the women are  the source of the difficulties,  but 
only  that  they  express  family  tensions  more  frequently  or more 
visibly.4 8  For a  man,  the  job  is  often supportive,  rewarding  him 
even if he is  emotionally disturbed, whereas for a  woman,  house-
hold and maternal functions  provide fewer  tangible rewards and 
more minute-to-minute  tension.  Being alone with small children 
seems to result in a kind of sensory deprivation for mothers, caus-
ing them  to  lose  touch with  their adult selves,  particularly when 
they are unduly isolated from the husband or other adults. When 
serious marital conflict develops,  the man may be more disturbed 
than the woman and may resort  to violence,  but she calls  the po-
lice,  and  it  takes  a  while  to  discover  who  is  actually  the  more 
troubled party. 

The  suggestion  that  mental  illness  has  nothing  to  do  with 
the suburbs may be surprising.  It contradicts not only the critics 
but some English studies which found unexpectedly high rates o( 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

treated and untreated mental illness, of all degrees of seriousness, 
in  new  towns, 47  and  American  research  in  suburbs  and  rapidly 
growing communities.48  These rates  are sometimes attributed  to 
the nature of suburban  life-falsely,  I  think. The suburbs-like 
the  English  new  towns-attract  young,  relatively  sophisticated, 
and  comparatively  better-educated  people  than  established  com-
munities.  As  a  result,  they  are  physically  healthier,  and routine 
anxieties  may  express  themselves  through  functional  illnesses 
more often than organic ones. A sophisticated population is  more 
aware of emotional  problems  and.  able to articulate  them,  and a 
new-town  population will undoubtedly include disturbed people 
who  came  to  the  town  to  cure  their  problems  or  at  least  escape 
from  the  scene  of previous disturbances.  As  a  result,  statistics  of 
treated and untreated cases  are  likely  to be  higher than in estab-
lished communities.49 

New suburbs also attract an unusually large number of socially 
mobile  people.  Downwardly mobile people  have  been shown  by 
many studies  to be  troubled  emotionally,  and  if  they come  to  a 
new community with  the  false  hope  of  improving  their lot  and 
find a majority of their neighbors upwardly mobile,  their difficul-
ties  may  only  increase.  Upwardly mobile people are occasionally 
beset by problems,  too,  and it is  perhaps no coincidence that the 
more  troubled  Levittowners  included working class  women who 
had  married  into  the  middle  class  or  had  left  a  cohesive  ethnic 
enclave.  Mobile people  make  considerable demands  on  commu-
nity  institutions  which  these  cannot  always  satisfy;  conversely, 
hyperactivity or social  isolation may drive troubled people to the 
breaking point. 

But  the notion  that  suburban  life  is  inherently  stressful  and 
dangerous for all its residents is simply inaccurate. The testimony 
of people  who  found  Levittown  more relaxing  than  their  previ-
ous residence, and my own observations about the relatively slow 
pace of community life, suggest that, if anything, stress is  reduced 
by the move  to suburbia.  If the stress  of organizational  life  is  as 
great  as  claimed,  it  touches  only  the  few  who  are  really  active, 
but most  such  Levittowners  were  already active  in  their  former 
communities, so  that Levittown did not create a  new strain.  The 
preplanned  founding  of  organizations  may  even  have  reduced 
the  pressure  of  newness  on  active  people.  Obviously,  stress  ex-
isted and continues to exist-as it does  in all human encounters-
but this does not make it inherently pathological. 

Family  and  Individual  Adaptation 

The American  study which  found  increased  mental  illness  in 
suburbia was done  in an upper middle class area;  quite possibly, 
upper  middle  class  life  is  more  nerve-racking than  that  of other 
groups,  particularly  for  people  newly  arrived  at  that  status.50 
This  would  explain  the  high  stress  among  a  suburban  Jewish 
population in Toronto so well described by Seeley and his associ-
ates.51  Such people could be  found  in Levittown  as  well,  putting 
inordinate  pressure  on  their  children  to  perform  well  in  school 
and running themselves ragged in community activities. Yet  they 
are  not  typical  of  suburbia  nor  is  their  behavior  inherently 
suburban. 

Indeed, my findings suggest that the major sources of stress are 
not  to  be  found  in  the  community,  but  in  being  left  out  of  it, 
excluded from  activities and relationships of crucial  personal  im-
portance.  Social  isolation  is  the m~E!_!!L~ be it from 
spouse,  neighbors,  friends,  or  organizations.  Even  among  upper 
middle  class  and  Jewish  Levittowners,  those  who  suffered  were 
not  the  hyperactive  ones  but  those  excluded  from  activity,  and 
especially  those  who,  not  fitting  in,  were  extruded  by  their 
groups.  Conversely,  initially  isolated  people  who  became  active 
in  Levittown  were  less  troubled  than  before,  even  when  their 
activity was hectic and seemingly full of potential stress. 

Social  isolation  can  affect  anyone,  all  classes  and  ages,  and can 
be found  in any community.  It probably strikes  newcomers and 
mobile persons more often, because they are moving from  an old 
to a  new  way  of life and  may  not fit  in.  Levittown, where every-
body  was  a  newcomer,  reduced  this  kind  of  isolation,  but  the 
smallness and homogeneity of the population made it difficult for 
the culturally and socially deviant to find companions. Levittown 
benefitted  the  majority but punished a  minority with  exclusion, 
what Whyte called the "misery of the deviate."  But if Levittown 
increased  their  chances  of  mental  illness,  it  had  the  opposite 
effect on a much larger number. 

I  have  purposely  concentrated  on  mental  illness  rather  than 
mental  health  in  Levittown,  because  most current definitions of 
the  latter  include,  overtly  or covertly,  a  conception  of  the  good 
life which usua!ly equates mental  health with an idealized  upper 
middle class cosmopolitan culture and  implies that other ways of 
living are  potentially  illness-producing.  This bias  fails  to  distin-
guish what is different from what is  pathological  in other subcul-
tures;  and until  research  shows,  for  example,  that the restrictive-

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

ness  and localism  of some kinds of working class  and lower mid-
dle  class  culture are  pathological,  it  is  impossible  to  accept  most 
current definitions of mental health. 

The  tendency to identify  the different as  pathological  is  at  the 
heart of  the suburban critique and  helps  to  account  for  the crit-
ics'  belief  that  suburban  life  is  undesirable.  Although  the  move 
to  the  suburbs  has  brought  about  many  positive  changes,  the 
critics  argue  that  these  are  spurious  and  the  suburbanites'  con-
tentment self-deceptive.  Because  the suburban way  of life  strikes 
them  as  intrinsically  dull,  its  sociability  unsatisfying.  and  its 
activities  boring,  they  believe  it will  inevitably  generate  consid-
erable ennui and mental illness in the future. 

There  is  no  evidence  to  back  up  these  predictions,  however, 
and  I  doubt  that  they  will  come  to  pass,  because  the  critics are 
not speaking of suburban conditions, but are,  again, making neg-
ative  judgments  about  lower middle  and working class  cultures 
based on their deviation from  cosmopolitan values.  Levittowners, 
not sharing these,  are not deprived of the  urban  pleasures of  the 
cultured cosmopolitan  since  they  did not  indulge  in these  pleas-
ures  even  when  they  lived  in  the  city.  Indeed,  none  who  were 
bored  in  Levittown  suggested  that  they  missed  what  cosmopol-
itans value  about  the  city.  On  the  other  hand,  alienation  from 
community life reported  by  some  highly  educated  Levittowners 
indicates that they share  the critics'  values.  As  it turns out,  then, 
the  critics  are  right  about  members  of  their  own  culture,  but 
wrong when they presume to judge and speak for the majority of 
Levittowners. 

References  to  suburban  malaise  also  express  the  critics'  reac-
tion  to novelty.  Suburbs  first  sprang  up around  American cities 
about a century ago,  but the talk about "suburban malaise" dates 
only  from  the  development  of  the  postwar  housing  develop-
ments.  Class  difference  intrudes  here  too,  for  at  first  suburbia 
(another  new  term)  was  accessible  only  to  the  upper  middle 
class.  The critics'  fears  arose  only when  lower-status  groups were 
able to  move  beyond  the city limits.  The critics seem  to be most 
threatened  by communities like  Levittowns which  are  a  new  so-
cial  invention.  In other countries, similar and equally inaccurate 
critiques are specifically directed at new settlements;  the English 
worry about "new-town blues," and the Japanese, about "Danchi-
byo," an ailment ascribed to brand new suburban projects called 
Danchi. 52  Of course,  the critics  are  not  the only ones  threatened 

Family  and  Individual  Adaptation 

•  241  • 

by newness.  For example,  Canadian  journalists and government 
officials  told  hair-raising  stories  of  social  disorganization  and 
mental  illness among Eskimos  in an  Arctic  new  town,  but syste-
matic  anthropological  research  concluded  they  were  untrue." 

SOME  SOLUTIONS  TO PROBLEMS  OF ADAPTATION 

Although  only  a  minority  of  Levittowners  encountered  prob-
lems and although few  of these were distinctive to suburbia,  they 
still  need  to  be  solved.  One  is  the  women's  feeling  of  being 
"stuck"  in  the house.  One solution would  be separating mothers 
and  children  during  part  of  the  day  through  community-wide 
nursery  schools  or  day-care  centers.  However,  these  are  most 
often used by well-educated women,  who suffer  least from  being 
"stuck."  The  failure  of  such  schools  to  reach  the  women  who 
need  them most  is  only partly one of cost  (which  could  be dealt 
with),  for  many  lower  middle and working class  mothers are  re-
luctant  to give up their children liecause  it implies  that  they are 
poor  mothers.  If nursery  schools  were  attached  to  the  public 
school  system,  they  might be  less  reluctant,  but  they  would  still 
need  to  find  activities  of  enough  significance  to  justify  leaving 
their children  in someone's care.  Women with  these  feelings are 
often  also  ill  at  ease  in  organizations,  but  they  would  respond 
favorably  to  work  opportunities.  However,  jobs  for  women,  ex-
cept  as  teachers,  are  a~  rare  in  Levittown  as  in  other  suburbs. 
Still, many unfilled community posts exist. The schools could use 
teachers' aides:  the hospitals, nurses'  aides;  and libraries, govern-
ment  offices,  and  other  public  agencies  could  improve  services 
with  auxiliary workers.  Levittowners  might  accept  tax  increases 
that  would  result  in  employment  for  women,  especially  in  the 
form of four- to six-hour jobs, but most likely jobs will have to be 
created through federal  programs like those now being instituted 
to  hire  and  train  ."nonprofessionals"  to  work  with  the  city's 
poor.e• 

For many women,  downtown  shopping and  window-shopping 
opportunities  are  sufficient  to  overcome  physical  isolation,  but 
quick  and  easy  access  to  the city  is  now not available,  and some 
even  have trouble getting  to  the  Levittown  shopping center.  At 
the  time  of  my  research,  the  demand  for  public  transportation 
was  too low  to  encourage private  enterprise  to  provide full  serv-
ice,  and  the  only  solution  is  a  system  subsidized  either  by  mer-

•  242  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

chants  or  by  a  federal  mass  transit  program. 55  Stores  within 
walking  distance  that  can  function  as  informal  meeting  centers 
for  adults  as  well  as  teenagers  would  also  help,  but  these  would 
have  to  be  located  so  as  to  preclude  fears  of  homeowners  about 
decline  in  property  values,  which  accompany  the  entrance  of 
commercial facilities into the hearts of residential areas. 

The second  and more serious  problem  is  social  isolation.  Ade-
quate public  transportation to the city would ameliorate  the sep-
aration from  parents for former  Philadelphians, and so  would re-
duced  telephone  charges.  A  call  from  Levittown  to  the  city  is 
now  a  long-distance  one,  and  people  who  want  to  be  in  daily 
touch  with  their  families  run  up  monthly  phone  bills  of $2o  or 
more,  which  they  cannot  afford.  For  some,  the  only  solution  is 
either a  return to the city or a  parental move to the suburbs. The 
dislike  of  urban  living  and  the  husband's  opposition  to  being 
near in-laws  prevents the former;  the high cost of suburban hous-
ing for  older people who own  their homes in  the city or pay low 
rent  discourages  the  latter.  Suburban  low-rent  housing  for  the 
elderly  might  attract  some  parents,  but  many  want  to  maintain 
social  ties  in  the  city  or  need  a  central  location  that  puts  them 
close to children living in different suburbs. Some Philadelphians 
might  not  have  moved  to  Levittown  had  they  known  the  emo-
tional cost of leaving parents, but there is now no agency to make 
people aware of this possibility.  One cannot expect builders to do 
it,  but discussion  of  the  problem  in  the  mass  media  might  help. 
Coping with  the  husband's absence  for  occupational reasons  is 
more difficult, although when automation begins to make inroads 
into white collar jobs, it should be possible  to decentralize offices 
to minimize extended  traveling or to reduce the salesman's  terri-
tory  to  an  area  that can  be covered  in  a  day  or  two.  Sometimes, 
occupational  absence  is  only a  symptom,  however,  for  men  who 
are  uncomfortable  in  the  marital  relationship  may choose  a  job 
that requires traveling. This is  part of the more general  problem 
of  marital  strain.  Difliculties  caused  by  financial  worries  can  be 
reduced  by long-term,  low-interest loans  for  the  period when  the 
costs of raising a family are greatest, or better still, by adoption of 
the European system of family allowance grants.  It would be pos-
sible  to set higher income thresholds to discourage  potential  buy-
ers  who  cannot  really  afford  home  ownership  or  suburbia,  but 
neither builders nor banks can be expected to do so.  Higher FHA 
thresholds  could  be  required,  but  preventing,. young  families 

Family  and  Individual  Adaptation 

from  realizing  the  living  standards  which  their  culture  is  con-
stantly  preaching  would  be  difficult  as  well  as  undesirable.  It 
would  be,  after  all,  tantamount  to  restricting  aspirations  and 
arguing that a  low-income family  is  not good  enough for  the sub-
urbs.  Extending the  recently established federal  rent-supplement 
program  to  the  purchase  of suburban  homes  would  be better. 

Other causes  of marital  difficulty  are  more  difficult  to resolve. 
Despite  the  social  isolation  of  partners  of  mixed  marriages,  it 
would  be  facile  to  discourage  marriage  across  religious  or  class 
lines, and wrong as well.  Nor can a return to the extended family 
be proposed or expected.  Even  if some  problems that face  young 
couples  (and  the  nuclear family  generally)  were  reduced  by  the 
presence  of  a  parent  or  other  relative  in  the  household,  new 
problems  would  arise.  The  Levittowners  who  previously  lived 
with  their  parents  all  reported  considerable  conflict  with  the 
older generation, and none wanted to move back with them.  One 
must accept  the reality of nuclear family  living, find  new  institu-
tions  and  functionaries  to  replace  the  parental  generation,  and 
help  people  learn  to  cope  with  the  strains  inevitable  to  the  nu-
clear  family.  Some  Levittowners  have  found  substitutes  among 
older  neighbors,  but  this  assumes  an  intimacy  in  the  neighbor 
relationship that is not often possible. 

Some  pressures  on  the  family  can  be  reduced  by  counseling, 
and  several  suburbs  have  developed  highly  successful  family 
counseling  agencies. 56  They  generally  attract  only  better-edu-
cated  families;  people  like  the  Levittowners  more  often  take 
their  problems  to  doctors  and  ministers.  Unfortunately,  both 
professions now treat counseling only as  a  sideline, and are often 
ill-trained  to  do  it  in  any case.  Levittown  patients  undoubtedly 
came  to  doctors  with  more  functional  and  "psychosomatic"  ill-
nesses  than  purely  organic  ones,  but  most  general  practitioners 
had  taken  only  introductory courses  in  psychiatry.  If these  doc-
tors were better trained. they could function  more adequately as 
counselors,  and  if  more  were  available,  they  could  spend  more 
time with each patient. Cost is a  fundamental  problem, however, 
and  until  Medicare  is  extended  to  young  families  and  to  those 
with emotional  problems as  well,  people will not get the counsel-
ing or the  systematic  psychotherapy  they  need.  Ministers do not 
charge  fees,  and  pastoral  counseling  is  likely  to become  a  more 
significant ministerial role in the near future. The churches must 
place more  stress on  this function, and a  builder like Levitt, who 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

gives  free  land  to  churches,  could  insist  that,  in exchange,  they 
appoint  ministers  who  are  properly  trained  in  pastoral  coun-
seling. 

Nevertheless,  family  counseling  agencies  should  attempt  to 
reach  working and lower  middle  class  clients.  They need  Medi-
care  or  other  public  support  to  extend  their  activities,  enlarge 
their staffs,  and make  their services less expensive, but they must 
also  reorient  themselves away from  upper middle class  culture.  I 
recall a visit to an agency in another Levittown;  it was  furnished 
in  Danish  Modern, with  The  New Yorker  and  Time magazines 
as reading materials, and classical music on the hi-fi system-thus 
effectively  telling  potential  clients  it was  an  upper  middle  class 
agency  before  they  even  got  in  to  see  a  counselor.  Counseling 
techniques  need  redesign  as  well,  to  provide  the  kinds  of  help 
acceptable to working and lower middle class clients.  Psychother-
apy  may  be  useful,  but  when  marital  conflicts  result  from 
financial  difficulties,  the  best  solution  is  a  loan;  when  the  prob-
lems  are  social,  it  is  to  help  clients  find  compatible  people. 
Psychoanalytic  methods  need  revamping  to  make  them relevant 
to  clients  less  trained  in  self-awareness  than  the  upper  middle 
class,  and  agencies  must  place  less  stress  on  professionalism,  in-
stead using the kinds of people and techniques that neighbors do 
when they provide therapy to each other across a  morning cup of 
coffee.  More  counselors  should  share  the  clients'  culture,  and 
more use should be made of the nonprofessional,  trained in pro-
fessional  techniques  but  able  to  combine  these  with  traditional 
nonprofessional  solutions  familiar  to  the  client  and  relevant  to 
his  situation. 57  Until  people  stop  treating  marital  problems  as 
shameful and counseling as a sign of defeat, agencies will have to 
be located outside  the  communities they serve. A  greater empha-
sis  on  children's  problems  would  also  help,  not  only  because 
many families have them, but also because parents are more will-
ing  to  bring children  in  for  treatment and can  be  persuaded  to 
accept  help  themselves  once  they  realize  their  own  role  in  the 
children's difficulties. 

The final  source  of  problems  is  social  isolation from  compati-
ble people.  Meeting people is easier in a new community than in 
an  established one, yet it remains difficult for  people who cannot 
find  the  right  ones,  are  unable  to  join  organizations,  or  suffer 
from  a  shortage  of  compatibles  in  the  community.  The  first 
group and  perhaps  the  third  can  be  helped  by developing local 

Family  and  Individual  Adaptation 

•  245  • 

publications which describe organizations not just by their activi-
ties but also by the kinds of people who belong-thus institution-
alizing a  function  often performed by  the grapevine. The second 
group  might  be  aided  by  the  formation  of  small  social  clubs, 
modeled on the coffee-klatsch  or the fellowship  groups of funda-
mentalist Protestants,  both of which serve  people with culturally 
based  difficulties  in  making new  friends.  The  third  group  must 
be aided  in  finding  compatible  people  outside  the  community; 
they  might also  be encouraged  to help old  friends  from  the  city 
to  move  to  their  suburb,  possibly  with  financial  incentives  pro-
vided  by  the builder.  Some  builders have  employed social  work-
ers  and community organizers  to  function  in what Gutman calls 
"integrator" roles,  and  these could  be helpful  in reducing social 
isolation provided they do not act as  front men for the builder to 
stifle complaints about the houses. 58 

None of these  proposals will  help  people who define  compati-
bility  by  ethnic  or  religious  criteria  or  those  who  suffer  from  a 
real shortage of compatible people that cannot be ameliorated by 
communications  devices.  Here,  perhaps  the  only  solutions  are 
negative  or  positive  methods  of  tenant  selection.  The  former 
would discourage purchasers whose social  life and emotional  sup· 
port depend on people not now living in the community, by tell-
ing  them  that  they  can  expect  to  be  lonely.  The  latter  would 
make  sure  that  cultural  and  social  mmorities  come  in  sufficient 
numbers to assure  them of social  ties.  One way of doing this is  to 
announce  in  advance  that  ethnic  and  religious  facilities  will  be 
available;  Levitt  did  this  in  order  to  attract  Jewish  buyers. 59  A 
builder could  even  encourage such  minorities  to  buy as  a  group 
by advertising  his  development  in  their  publications  and  giving 
discounts  to  groups  of  significant  size,  without,  however,  either 
helping or preventing them  from  living next door to  each other. 
These proposals would exen  increase  the diversity  of  the com-
munity and achieve  the  planner's aim  for  balance,  not  to  dupli-
cate  urban cross  sections _based  on  statistical  artifact  but  to  pro-
mote  happier  lives.  For  the  people  concerned,  however,  homo-
geneity would be increased and ethnic assimilation inhibited, but 
I  would  argue  that  involuntary  heterogeneity  and  assimilation 
policies are rarely effective,  and  in a  community like  Levittown, 
many opportunities exist  for  those  who  want diversity  and  free-
dom from ethnic tradition. 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

NOTES 

1.  On matriarchy see  Duhl; on mental illness,  Gordon,  Gordon, and 
Gunther.  Yet  another  critic,  Wyden,  eschews  matriarchy,  but 
blames  the  suburbs  for  producing  children  that  dominate  their 
parents. 

2.  The  interview  questions  assumed  that  boredom,  loneliness,  etc., 
existed,  and  asked  respondents  to  estimate  their  own,  requiring 
them  to  volunteer  if  they  were  never  bored.  Comparisons  with 
the  former  residence  similarly  asked  whether  there  was  more  or 
less  boredom,  etc.,  in  Levittown,  forcing  them  to  volunteer  if  it 
had  remained  the  same.  They  did  not  hesitate  to  do  so,  and 
probably did not underestimate seriously  the  amount or increase 
of  boredom. 

3·  Eighty-three  per  cent  of  them,  but  only  20  per  cent  of  the  sub-
urban  and  small-town  respondents,  wished  husbands  to  be  with 
children more often. 

4·  I;or the sample as a  whole, 52  per cent of the wives  said  their hus-
bands were spending more time with the children, 11  per cent less, 
and  37  per cent the same. 

5·  For  the random  sample,  the median  trip decreased  from  36  min-
utes to 35· Twenty-nine per cent reported a  short trip; 34 per cent 
a  medium  one;  26  per  cent  a  long  one;  and  11  per  cent  a  very 
long one. 

6.  Among the random sample,  42  per cent experienced an increased 
commute,  45  per cent  a  decreased  one. The median  increase  was 
15  minutes;  the median decrease,  28. 

7·  Random sample respondents with an increased work trip also trav-
eled  a  median  45  minutes  now,  but  44  per  cent  traveled  4o--59 
minutes, and 19 per cent an hour or longer. 

8.  Among men with medium-length trips,  17  per cent liked it,  12  per 
cent  disliked  it,  55  per  cent  "don't  mind"  it,  and  16  per  cent 
"don't care one way  or the other."  For those  reporting long  trips, 
however,  only  3  per cent  liked  it,  30  per cent  disliked  it,  47  per 
cent  "don't mind,"  and  20  per  cent  "don't  care."  For  men  with 
very long trips, the percentages were 3, 44, 42,  and  11  respectively. 
The  proportion  of  dislikes  rose  from  15  per cent  among  people 
with  3o--3g-minute  trips  to  32  per  cent  with  4o--45-minute  trips. 
g.  However,  75  per cent of  the  Philadelphians  drove  their own  car, 
and only 20  per cent  belonged to a  car pool. Six  per cent used the 
bus, but many employed women, whose  response was  not studied, 
used it to get to work. 

10.  Professionals  and  intellectuals  who  work  in  solitude  have  more 
privacy,  and  since  time  is  their  scarcest  resource,  probably  find 
driving  to  work  a  boring  and  unnecessary  expenditure  of  time. 

Family  and  Individual  Adaptation 

•  247  • 

Among  the  Levittowners,  half  the  professionals  and  white  collar 
workers,  but  only  29  per  cent  of  the  blue  collar  workers,  found 
driving  40  minutes  or  more  to  work  wearing.  Moreover,  profes-
sionals and white collar workers  reported longer  commutes,  both 
before  and  in  Levittown,  than  blue  collar  ones.  These  findings 
suggest why planners have been more anxious about the suburban 
journey to work than many of the people for whom they are plan-
ning. 

11.  For  a  similar  finding  see  Blood  and  Wolfe,  p.  172. 
12.  Thirty-seven per cent of the wives  had more  time  with  their hus-
bands,  13  per cent,  less,  and half,  the same.  For the  husbands,  the 
percentages  were  4,  6,  and 50 respectively. 

13.  Eighty per cent of the wives whose husbands have short work trips 
report spending more time with them,  as  compared to  20 per cent 
and  33  per cent of those  whose  husbands have  medium  and  long 
trips.  The husbands who report more  time  with  their wives  have 
shorter work trips since the move. 

14.  The question  was  worded,  "Does your family  do  more  things  to-
gether in Levittown than where you lived before, or fewer  things?" 
Although  the  interviewer did  not  suggest  that  more  joint family 
activity  was  desirable,  respondents answered as  if it were. 

15.  In  the  first  interview  43  per cent reported  more,  2  per  cent  less, 
and 55  per cent the same.  In the second,  the percentages  were 45, 
10,  and  45· 

16.  The interview question read, "How do you  and your husband (or 
wife)  get along in  Levittown,  better  than  where  you  lived  before 
or not as  well?"  In  the  random sample,  23  per cent  reported  im-
provement, 3 per cent deterioration, and 74 per cent no change; in 
the  Philadelphia  one,  the  figures  were  20,  11,  and  69  per  cent 
respectively. 

17.  Comparative  studies  of  urban  and  suburban  marriages  surveyed 
by  Ubell found  little difference  in marital  happiness  when  social 
and economic variations  between  suburbanites  and  city  dwellers 
were controlled. 

18.  Since suicide is  a crime in  New Jersey, attempts must be reported 
to  the  police,  and  the  number appearing on  the  police  blotter is 
probably  accurate. 

19.  People were asked whether their "disposition or state of mind had 
gotten better, worse  or stayed  the same since  they moved  to Levit-
town." 

20.  Among  the  random  sample,  34  per  cent  of  the  women  reported 
better morale,  11  per cent,  worse,  and 55  per cent,  no change.  For 
the  men,  the percentages were  39,  o,  and 61  per cent respectively. 
Among  the  Philadelphia  men,  28  per cent  said  their  morale  was 
better,  17 per cent, worse, and 55  per cent, no change. 

11.  Twenty  per  cent  of  working  class  Philadelphians  were  happier, 
but 40 per cent were unhappier. In a  predominantly working class 
English  new  town,  19  per  cent  reported  better  "general  fitness," 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

12  per cent,  worse,  and 68  per cent,  no  change.  About  the  same 
proportions  obtained  for  ability  to  sleep,  but  30  per cent  had  a 
better  appetite  and  only  6  per  cent  a  poorer  one.  Taylor  and 
Chave, p.  39· 

22.  The men's disposition  is  not affected  by  a  longer  work  trip. 
23.  In  the  working class  English  new  town,  26  per  cent  were  now  in 
better  health,  14  per  cent  in  poorer.  Taylor  and  Chave,  p.  38. 
Among Philadelphia working class  respondents  in  Levittown,  the 
proportions  reporting  change  were  about  the  same,  21  per  cent 
reporting better health and  the same  number poorer. 

24.  "Nervous" English new-town residents also reported poorer health 

than  the rest.  Taylor and Chave,  pp.  55-56. 

25.  Among the  Philadelphians,  45  per cent of  the  well  educated  and 
57 per cent of the least educated, and 6o  per cent of the blue collar 
workers  reported  some  boredom;  16,  36,  and  20  per  cent  were 
bored  at  least  a  few  times  a  month.  The  English  working  class 
new-town survey distinguished only between the absence and pres-
ence of boredom,  and  found  38  per cent were  bored,  with  no dif-
ference  between  the  sexes.  Taylor  and  Chave,  computed  from 
Table 33· p. 66. 

26.  The  group  reporting  no  change  includes  31  per  cent  who  were 
never bored, either in Philadelphia or Levittown;  among the ran-
dom  sample,  the  percentage  is  23. 

27.  In  the random sample,  19  per cent of the women and  12  per cent 
of  the  men  report  new or  increased  boredom;  for  57  and  41  per 
cent,  respectively,  it  has  decreased  or  disappeared.  Among  the 
Philadelphians,  32  per cent of the women  and  17  per cent  of  the 
men  say  they  are  more  or  newly  bored;  30  per  cent  and  5  per 
cent,  respectively,  say  they  are  less  or no longer bored. 

28.  Although  6o  per  cent  in  this  group  who  do  less  couple  visiting 
are  more bored now,  so  are  38  per cent of those  doing more,  and 
44  per  cent  of  those  doing  more  neighbor  visiting.  However,  a 
quarter of  those  who  found  someone  spoke  of  less  boredom,  but 
none of those unable to find  someone. 

29.  Pierson's  study showed  that So  per cent  reported  no  change,  and 
the  general  pattern  did  not  vary  with  length  of  residence.  The 
kinds of  people  who  are  bored  and  the  r~asons they  give  are  the 
same  as  in the  newer Levittown.  Only well-educated  women com-
plain  about  boredom  more  than  in  Levittown,  New Jersey,  per-
haps because they are more isolated in a  community with a  larger 
working class  population. 

30.  Only women were asked about loneliness, since  the first  interview 
had  shown  that  none  of  the  men  felt  lonely.  I  do  not  know 
whether they  were  reporting accurately  or refusing to admit  to  a 
feeling  associated  with women. 

31.  The  question  on  loneliness  appeared  in  a  different  part  of  the 
interview schedule  from  the one on  boredom  to  prevent overlap. 

Family  and  Individual  Adaptation 

In  the  random sample,  6o  per cent of  those  lonely  a  few  times  a 
month  or  more  are  also  bored  that  often,  and  vice  versa.  Only 
38  per cent  of  bored  Philadelphians  are  lonely,  and  70  per  cent 
of the "never bored"  are at least occasionally  lonely. 

32.  The  English  new-town  survey  found  26  per  cent  of  the  women 
lonely,  boredom  also  overlapping  with  loneliness.  Men  were  as 
often  bored  as  women,  but reported little  loneliness.  Taylor and 
Chave,  computed from  Table 33  and pp. 66-67. 

33·  This  is  purely  a  guess,  but  of  the  nine  women  in  the  random 
sample  lonely  before  Levittown  and  still  lonely  now,  one  was 
lonely  a  few  times  a  week,  and  four  more  a  few  times  a  month. 
The first  would  represent  3  per cent of  the  total  sample,  the  lat-
ter  15  per  cent,  but  it -is  questionable  whether  people  who  are 
lonely  that  infrequently can  be called  chronic  cases. 

34·  In the random sample, 44  per cent of salesmen's and pilots'  wives 
and none of office  and factory  workers'  said  they were  lonely. 
35·  In  both  samples,  the  35  pe~ cent  reporting  no  change  said  they 

had  never  been  lonely  in  either residence. 

36.  Fifty-eight  per cent of the  random  sample  and 41  per cent of the 
city  one  said  they  had  been  lonely  the  first  six  months,  but  they 
all  reported  less  loneliness  after  two  years.  Interestingly  enough, 
when  they  were  first  interviewed,  only  19  per cent  of  the  former 
said  they  were  lonely,  although  after  two  years,  58  per  cent  re-
membered being lonely  at the start.  Evidently,  loneliness was  felt 
less  while  it  was  actually  being  endured,  perhaps  because  many 
people  shared  it,  perhaps  because  standards  for  loneliness  had 
risen  in  the  meantime. 

37·  The  question  was,  "Did  you  have  any  close  family,  I  mean  rel-

atives you were really close  to, where you lived before?" 

38.  Sixty  per  cent of  the  least  educated  and  67  per cent  of  the  blue 
collar  wives  miss  someone,  but  so  do  53  per  cent  of  the  better 
educated, and 57 per cent of the white collar wives.  Wives of pro-
fessionals  do not miss  their families,  however. 

39·  Thirty-nine  per  cent miss  them  as  much,  and  15  per cent,  more. 
40.  Sixty-eight  per cent of  the  women  with  close  relatives  in  the  city 
are lonely in Levittown, as compared to 34  per cent without them, 
but  those  who  miss  relatives  are  no  lonelier  than  those  who  do 
not miss them. People who now miss  their families more than they 
did  at  the  start  are  lonelier  than  those  who  now  miss  them  less 
or no more than before. 

41.  People  were  asked,  "Making  a  home  and  raising  a  family  some-
times brings problems such as illnesses, discipline problems, school 
problems,  marriage  problems,  job  or  money  problems,  and  the 
like.  What problems  have  you  and your family  experienced  since 
you  moved  to  Levittown?"  The  Philadelphians  were  also  asked, 
"What  things  have  you  worried  about  more  since  you  moved  to 
Levittown?" 

•  250  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

42.  In  the  English  new  town,  only  33  per cent  reported  problems,  fi. 
nancial ones being mentioned most often and illness second.  Tay· 
lor and  Chave,  computed  from  Table  38  and  pp.  77-78. 

43·  A  quarter  of  Philadelphians  with  rising  incomes,  but  two  thirds 
of  those  with  decreasing  and  55  per cent  of  those  with  stable  in-
comes,  worried  over  finances. 

44·  The most explicit statement of  this charge is  in Gordon, Gordon, 

and  Gunther. 

45·  In  the English new town,  33  per cent of the adults reported "sub-
clinical neurotic symptoms," and 14  per cent more were treated by 
general practitioners and psychiatrists.  Taylor and Chave,  p.  166. 
These rates are lower than reported for cities;  a  New York survey, 
for  example,  found  almost  So  per  cent  of  the  population  beset 
with  psychiatric symptoms ranging from mild to serious. See Srole 
et al. 

46.  English  studies  also  report  more  emotional  difficulties  among 
women  than  men.  See  Martin,  Brotherston,  and  Chave;  Taylor 
and Chave,  p.  125. 

47·  Martin,  Brotherston,  and  Ci}ave.  A  later  study  concluded,  how· 
ever,  that there were no differences in the number reporting "ner-
vous symptoms" in an old town, a new town, and a  new dormitory 
suburb.  See  Taylor and Chave,  p. 49· 

48.  The Cordons  found  a  higher incidence of emotional disorders  in 
newly suburbanizing counties than in nearby rural areas.  Gordon 
and Gordon;  and Gordon, Gordon,  and Gunther. A  study of fifty 
Massachusetts  communities by Wechsler found  that rapid growth 
resulted in significantly higher rates of hospitalized depressive dis· 
orders and suicide. 

49·  Martin, Brotherston, and Chave found mental illness and psycho-
neurotic symptoms highest among newly arrived residents and the 
old people. Taylor and Chave (p.  125)  found them  highest among 
the latter.  Psychologists  active  in American  suburbs have  also ob· 
served "post-occupancy depression," e.g., in Urban Studies Center, 
pp.  13-14,  but I  saw  little  of it in  Levittown.  If it  had  occurred, 
one would expect the  random sample  to have reported lower mo-
rale in the first  interview than in the second, but it did not. 

50.  The  Cordons  contrasted  the  suburbs  with  an  agricultural  com-
munity  which  seemed  more  ideal  than  real,  and  their  findings 
may  show  only  that  suburbs  for  the  upwardly  mobile  are  more 
stressful  than  static  but  affluent  rural  areas.  This  critique  is  de· 
tailed in Gans (1962c).

59·  He identified a site for a synagogue on the community map before 
the  community  was  occupied  and  before  any  plans  for  a  Jewish 
congregation  had  been  made.  Jewish  buyers  were  thus  told  that 
the Jewish  population  would  be  large  enough  for  a  temple,  and 
it became a  self-fulfilling  prophecy.  Of course,  Levittown  also  at-
tracted  Jews  because  the  builder  is  Jewish,  for  many  seem  to 
choose houses built by  their coreligionists when they can.

THE  IMPACT  OF 
THE  COMMUNITY

CRITICS  OF  SUBURBAN  LIFE  ASSUME  THAT  THE  UNDESIRABLE  FEA-
tures of life beyond  the city limits are  produced  by behavior and 
attitude changes people undergo  when  they move  out there, and 
thus  they conclude  that  it  is  necessary  to  do away  with  or trans-
form  the suburbs if American civilization is  to be preserved.  City 
planners assume  similarly  that  the  community creates a  negative 
impact  on  people,  and  propose  policies  for  a  "well-planned" 
community  that will  produce more desirable  behavior.  By  "com-
munity"  the  planner  means  the  "physical"  community;  the  ar-
chitecture,  site  layout,  transportation  system,  and  array  of  com-
munity  facilities  must,  he  argues,  be  altered  through  a  master 
plan  that  will  then  improve  the  social  environment. 

A  number of sociological  studies  have  effectively  questioned 
the  amount  of  change  that  results  from  the  suburban  move. 1 
Consequently, I have tried to go one step further:  to find out who 
is  actually changed by the move and how, and which sources and 
agents within that complex mixture of physical, economic, social, 
and  political  components  we  call  "the  community"  create  the 
change and therefore its  impact.2  By  sources,  I  mean such  causal 
factors  as  the move from  apartment to house or from city to sub-
urb,  as  well  as  Levittown's  social  structure.  Unless  the  real 
sources can  be isolated,  effective  policies for  altering and improv-
ing  the  community cannot  be  formulated.  In  this  connection,  I 
proposed  in  the  Introduction  that  change  could  be  either  in-

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

•  253  • 

tended or unintended, the former resulting from  the reasons and 
aspirations for  moving to  the suburbs, the latter developing after 
people  move  out,  and  therefore  traceable  to  the  community  it-
self.  Intended changes. can  be  satisfied  or  frustrated  in  the  com-
munity, but since their origin lies  elsewhere,  their elimination-
if that is  desired--<:an come only by altering people's aspirations 
or creating better solutions for  existing aspirations.  Unintended 
changes  can  be  dealt .with  by  intervention  in  the  community, 
however,  provided  their  sources  are  in  the  community  and  are 
not  outside  ones  such  as  the  national  economy,  or  extraneous 
ones  such  as  the  impact of children's ages  on  family  cohesion. 

I  must repeat that the data are based on small samples and can-
not  be  considered  statistically significant.  Nevertheless,  the  find-
ings are valid, because they often fit  into a  pattern. Levittown has 
created similar changes for similar kinds of people, and these can 
be attributed to a  limited number of sources, some related  to the 
community,  many  unrelated. 

GENERAL BEHAVIOR  CHANGE 

The overall  amount  of change  after the  move  to  Levittown  can 
be  estimated  from  the  fact  that  three  fourths  of  both  samples 
mentioned  one  or  more  changes  in  their  lives. 3  Many  changes 
were  intended:  62  per  cent  of  those  reported  in  the  first  inter-
view  with  the  random  sample,  51  per  cent  in  the  second.  Pre-
occupancy aspirations  were  realized  as  well,  since  86  per cent of 
the  random  sample  achieved  the  changes  it  had  desired.  How-
ever,  48  per  cent  of  those  not  wanting  any  change  also  experi-
enced some, suggesting the emergence of unintended effect. 

In  the  first  interview  the  most  change,  as  well  as  the  highest 
proportion  of  intended  change,  was  reported  by  previous  city 
dwellers,  apartment  dwellers,  and  renters.  Suburbanites,  small-
town residents, and owners encountered not only less  change but 
less  intended change. This finding can be explained by the kinds 
of changes people reported. Early intended ones were mainly the 
increased  morale  stemming from  home  ownership  and  the  satis-
factions  from  increased  visiting,  which  were  of course  principal 
moving  reasons  for  urbanites,  but already  familiar  experiences 
for  former  suburbanites.  The  latter  therefore  reported  more 
unintended change. 4  High-status  people reported  change  and in-
tended change more often  than low-status  people;  the latter had 

•  254  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

perhaps  thought  less  specifically  about  the  future  and  were 
surprised  by  unexpected  effects.  As  one  working  class  Levit-
towner put it: 

We  didn't  know  before  we  moved  here  that  we  would 
entertain  more,  go  out  less.  Not  that we  were boozehounds 
before,  though.  Not  that  we  can't afford  to go  out;  we  just 
don't want to.  We have a new house and want to keep it up 
nice;  this  is  not work but enjoyment.  I've never been more 
content.  In  the  city,  we  looked  forward  to  going  to  the 
shore;  here my mind is  occupied all  the time.  Over there,  if 
she  asked  me  to  wash,  paint,  I'd  throw  my  things  at  her; 
here  I  do  it  . . .  I  even  gave  up  fishing  here.  Working  in 
the  yard  is  just  like  fishing,  so  relaxing.  I  have  more  pep 
here than in Philadelphia. 

By  the second  interview  former  city residents  report  the  most 
unintended change, class  differences have vanished,  and even  the 
people  who  had  thought  a  lot  about  their  life  in  Levittown  be-
fore  arrival  now  report more  unintended than  intended change. 
The major unintended effects  are  increased organizational  activ-
ity  and  more  visiting  (half  the  respondents  mentioning  the 
former,  14  per cent the latter),  but 25  per cent are now negative 
ones--not having enough  friends  or missing  parents back home. 
The principal  intended  changes  were,  as  before,  the  satisfaction 
of  the  house  and  more  visiting.  Even  so,  when  it  comes  to  the 
source  of  change,  67  per  cent  is  now  attributable  to  the  social 
structure  of  the  new  community  and  only  25  per  cent  to  the 
house. 

Women reported more change, and more of the intended vari-
ety than men did, in both interviews, probably because they were 
more interested in the house to begin with. The men were more 
surprised by the pleasures of their house and  the new social  life. 
Among the  Philadelphians,  there was  less  sexual difference, men 
reporting as  much change as women, indicating the impact of the 
move from city to suburb. 

A  second  way  of estimating the  overall  impact of  the commu-
nity  is  through  a  summary  of  changes  reported  for  individual 
types  of  behavior.  As  Table  7  indicates,  the  move  typically  re-
sulted in change for  only about half the respondents.  Since none 
experienced a  consistent  pattern of change across  all  types  of be-
havior,  however, people could not be divided simply into chang-
ers and nonchangers. 

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

•  255  • 

SPECIFIC BEllA VIOR CHANGES 

Levittown's  impact  and  the  reasons  for  its  impact  are  best  de-
scribed through specific behavior changes and their sources. Some 
of  the data  reported  in  previous chapters  (on  individual  adapta-
tion,  family  life,  and  visiting)  are  reanalyzed  briefly  to  identify 
the sources  which  produced the changes already reported.  (All  of 
the data, old and new, are brought together in Table 7-) 

Individual Adaptation 

The  sources  of  change  in  morale,  boredom,  loneliness,  and 
worries  are  often  similar,  and  can  be  traced  to  the  house,  home 
ownership,  social  life  (these being the  major  sources of improve-
ment),  social  isolation, and  separation from  relatives. The major 
non-Levitto}Vn  sources  (aside  from  those  causing chronic  depres-
sion  and  loneliness)  are  probably age  and  the  husband's absence 
from  the  home.  Higher morale can  be traced  to the  house, since 
apartment  dwellers  experienced  the  greatest  increase,  although 
among former urbanites the role  of  the  yard in  decreasing adult 
supervision of children was  also mentioned.~ Estimating roughly, 
about  half  the  reduction  in  boredom  could  be  traced  to  work 
around the house and yard, a quarter to social and organizational 
activities, and the rest to a combination of the two. 

Since  the  Philadelphia  sample-particularly  the  women-
showed less  improvement and more deterioration  for all  types  of 
adaptation,  it  would  seem  not  only  that  the  move  from  city  to 
suburb resulted in undesirable emotional effects but also that the 
move  causes  change  in  individual  adaptation.  A  more  detailed 
analysis  indicates  otfis:rwise,  however.  For  one  thing,  half  the 
Philadelphians were  bored  before coming to  Levittown,  suggest-
ing that city life can  bring on ennui  too.  (The source was lack of 
compatible  neighbors,  particularly  among  apartment  dwellers.) 
Since the same people reported higher morale, less  boredom, and 
less  loneliness  in  Levittown,  the  move  and  the  population  mix 
that created  Levittown's social  life  had a  positive  impact.  Never-
theless,  both  the  lower  morale  and  the  greater  boredom  experi-
enced  by  some  Philadelphians  stem  from  community-related 
sources in Levittown:  physical and social  isolation and separation 
from  relatives.  Former  Philadelphians  were  stuck  in  the  house 
without  the  access  to  downtown  stores  that  had  previously

• The  number  of  persons  responding  for  the  random  sample  is  usually  44,  for  the  Philadelphia  one,  55·  In  the  former,  N  for

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

assuaged  boredom.  Among  them,  those  who  found  friends  and 
organizations  suffered  less,  but  socially  isolated  working  class 
people suffered  more.  Depression,  boredom,  and  loneliness  were 
most  serious among people who  had formerly  been  close  to  par-
ents and childhood friends,  however,  so  that it was  not the move 
from  city to suburb, but from a  particular kind of city life-that 
of  the  working class  or ethnic "urban village"-which  produced 
deleterious  effects.  Only  28  per  cent  of  the  overall  increase  in 
boredom could be attributed to Levittown, suggesting that much 
boredom was prior or chronic. 

The  sources  of  impact  can  also  be  seen  through  long-run 
change.  Levittown's  social  life  reduced  boredom  for  the  previ-
ously  isolated,  but  its  newness  provided  only  temporary  respite 
for  many  Philadelphians,  their  boredom  returning  as  physical 
and social  isolation and familial  loneliness beset them. Yet  Levit-
town's permanent role was minor;  two thirds of these women had 
been bored  in  Philadelphia  too.  For about a  quarter of the total 
sample of city women, and about  10 per cent of men,  Levittown 
meant  new  boredom,  however,  social  isolation  being  the  major 
source and the role change from  worker to mother the second. 

Loneliness  existed  among  48  per  cent  of  the  random  sample 
women  and  22  per  cent  of  the  Philadelphians  before  they  ever 
came to Levittown;  even then it was  due to  the same factors  that 
caused it in Levittown-the husband's traveling, separation from 
relatives,  and social  isolation.  The random sample  proportion  is 
high because of Transients who are far  away from  their parents; 
the  Philadelphia  one  is  low  because  they  were  still  close.  The 
new opportunities for visiting ended social loneliness for all those 
previously  isolated,  and  even  reduced  it  for  Transients  missing 
their parents. But 43  per cent of the Philadelphians found  them-
selves  newly  lonely,  because of  the  absence  of  husband,  of  rela-
tives,  and  because  of  social  isolation-in  that  order.  Loneliness 
also  increased  over  time, familial  as  well as  social  loneliness hav-
ing been held back at first  by the newness of the community. 

Levittown's quantitative  impact  on  loneliness  was  as  follows: 
12  per cent  of  the random  sample  (and  8  per cent of  the  Phila-
delphia one)  found  that loneliness  had disappeared or decreased 
after  the  move;  4  per cent  (and  11  per cent),  that  it rose  during 
the  early  months  in  Levittown  but  then  disappeared;  another 4 
per  cent  (and  5  per  cent),  that  it  disappeared  at  first  and  then 
returned;  and  19  per cent  (and  43  per cent),  that it was  created 

The  Impact  of  the  Community

by  the move.  A  significant  proportion was  not affected  by Levit-
town  at all,  however;  35  per cent  of  the  random  sample  (and  8 
per cent of the Philadelphia one)  had been lonely at least once a 
month  before  and  remained  so  in  Levittown,  and  26  per  cent 
(and  25  per cent)  said  they  had  never  been and  were  not lonely 
now. 

Problems and worries, which also contributed to lower morale, 
could  be  traced  to  Levittown  in  about  two  thirds  of  the  cases. 
These  resulted  principally  from  financial  problems  due  to  the 
higher cost of living,  the sources being both home ownership and 
such  community-related  features  as  greater  cat  expenses  and 
taxes.  Sixty-three  per  cent  of  the  Philadelphians  reported  new 
worries after coming  to  Levittown.  Of all  their worries,  about a 
third were old ones,  55  per cent were  new and  related  to  Levit-
town,  and  15  per  cent  were  new  but  unrelated.  Once  more, 
financial  worries were uppermost among new ones,  but a quarter 
stemmed  from  the  impact  of  heterogeneity  on  children's  be-
havior  at  home  and  at  school.  Conversely,  over  a  third  of  both 
samples  found  problems  and  worries  reduced  or  disappearing, 
the space  provided by  the  house  giving people more privacy  and 
making  family  life  less  discordant,  and  the  lack  of  traffic  in  the 
streets eliminating fear for the children's safety. 

Family  Life 

Levittown's impact on family life represented the achievement 
of an  intended change  for  most  people,  the new  house playing a 
major role.  Family members who wanted more time together had 
it,  partly  because  commuting  did  not  increase,  but  mainly  be-
cause they wanted it.  More time was diverted to the family  by in-
creased opportunity to do things together, at first  in fixing up the 
house  and  yard. 6  The  role  of  the house  is  demonstrated  further 
by  the  sharp  increase  in  joint  family  activity  among  former 
apartment  dwellers,  whether  they  came  from  cities  or  suburbs. 
Part of the impact of the house was the result of novelty, for after 
two years  people cited  patio and  community recreational  oppor-
tunities  as  more  important  than  the  house.  These  interests  may 
also  wear  off  over  time,  although  40  per cent of  the  respondents 
reported  more  joint activity at  the  time  of  the  second  interview 
than at the first,  and only 3 per cent reported less.  For former city 
dwellers,  the  long-term  impact  of  house and community  is  even 
greater,  for  62  per cent found  more joint family  activity  than  at 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

arrival,  as  compared  to only 30  per cent of former suburbanites. 
A  second  source  of  family  cohesion,  perhaps  most  important  in 
the  long run,  was  the  age  of children,  which  was  extraneous  to 
Levittown, and suggests  that suburbia  per se  plays  only a  minor 
role in familial change. 

The  sources  of  increased  cohesion  among  spouses  are  also 
house and community, but after two years the former has not yet 
lost its novelty value for former city dwellers,  suggesting that the 
move to a  house is  more  important than  that to  the suburb. The 
Philadelphians also reported some  decrease, largely as  a result of 
babies'  taking  time  away  from  the  parents,  older children  sepa· 
rating them when  they  leave  the  family  to  be with other young-
sters, and men's longer work  hours. 

Three  quarters  of  the  random  sample  attributed  what  little 
change  took  place  in  the quality of married Hfe  to  joint activity 
around the house, greater privacy gained by additional space, and 
"maturity"  associated  with  home  ownership.1  Two  years  later, 
the  impact  of  the  house  had  begun  to  wear  off,  but  again,  not 
among  the  Philadelphians,  who  still  give  it as  the prime reason 
for  getting  along better  with  their spouses. 8  Even  so,  the group 
reporting  better marital  relations  most  often are  men who  have 
moved  away  from  parents and  in-laws,  50  per cent  saying  their 
marriages had improved. Only 14  per cent of the women felt this 
way, but neither they nor the men reported poorer marriages as a 
result of leaving parents. The suburban separation from relatives 
thus has some family benefits to counteract the emotional costs  to 
the  individual.  But  suburbia  had  marital  costs  too;  almost  all 
Philadelphians who reported a  poorer marriage blamed financial 
problems contracted in Levittown. 

Although English new-town studies have reported that nuclear 
family  cohesion  increases  after  separation  from  the  extended 
family  in  the  city,  this  was  not  the  case  among  Levittowners.11 
People  having  close  relatives  in  Philadelphia,  those  who  missed 
them,  and  even  those  who  had  lived  with  them  before  all  re-
ported doing  fewer  things  with  their spouse  in  Levittown  than 
people  without  relatives  in  the  city.  Marital  life,  however,  im-
proved among couples who did not miss close relatives.10 

Because  arrival  in  Levittown  was  followed  by a  rash  of preg-
nancies  (and  much  joking  about  it as  well),  people  were asked 
whether "living here  had anything to do with your wanting an-

•  261  •

other  child."  The  jokes  had  children  being  conceived  because 
entertainment facilities were scarce,  and later,  because pregnancy 
was  fashionable-the  "suburbia  as  rabbit  hutch"  myth.  Forty· 
three  per  cent  of  the  random  sample  and  62  per  cent  of  the 
Philadelphia sample had  children  after moving,  but  71  per cent 
of the fonner and 53  per cent of the latter said they had intended 
to enlarge their families.  None of the remainder ascribed the new 
babies  to  Levittown;  11  they  explained  that  they  either  did  not 
practice  birth  control  or  that  the  children  were  "accidental." 12 
Perhaps  the latter came as  an  unintended result--or expectation 
--of  greater  contentment  in  Levittown,  for  one  woman  said 
blithely, "It just happened when we were moving." 

Neighbor and Couple  Visiting 

The sizeable increases in visiting were largely  intended, 40 per 
cent  of  the  random  sample  saying  they  came  to  Levittown  with 
the idea of doing more visiting of both kinds.  Levittown enabled 
them to achieve  their wish,  for  the greatest increase was  reported 
by  those  intending it. 13  Yet  there  were also  unintended changes, 
mostly  in the direction of more visiting. 14  The sources of change 
are  the  newness  of  the community and  the  population  mix;  the 
friendliness of the people and the availability of compatible ones 
even  persuading  some  to  do  more  visiting  than  they  had  in-
tended.  Decreases,  largely  unintended,  were  explained  by  the 
lack of compatible people. 16 

If suburbia  had  a  significant  impact  on  social  life,  one  would 
expect former city dwellers to report a greater increase in visiting 
than  former suburbanites, and  this occurred  in neighboring,  but 
not  in  couple  visiting.  However,  even  the  increase  in  neighbor-
ing  is  more  a  result  of  the  move  from  apartment  to  house  than 
from  city to  suburb,  and from  transitional  areas,  urban. and sub-
urban,  where  compatible  neighbors  were  scarcer. 16  Compatibil-
ity  in  Levittown  is  more  influential  than  the  move,  for  not  all 
fanner city residents reported the same changes.  Moreover, being 
integrated into the community played a  major role.  In both sam-
ples,  organizationaily  active  people  and  Jews,  who  were  so  weii 
organized  as  an  ethnic  group,  reported  the  greatest  increases  in 
couple  visiting,  whereas  partners  in  mixed  marriages  reported 
significant  decreases.  The  lesser  increase  in  couple  visiting  as 
compared to neighboring among  Philadelphians is  e)'plained  by 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

their continued association with old friends  in the city, although 
those  lacking  compatible  people  in  Levittown  preferred  old 
friends more than the rest. 17 

Changes  over  time  again  identify  the  primary  sources  of 
change.  If the  initial  increase  in  visiting  had  been  due  to  the 
community's  newness,  decreases  should  have  taken  place  after 
two  years,  but 30  per cent of  the random sample reported  more 
neighboring  then  than  after  six  months  (when  most  said  they 
had  settled  down),  43  per  cent  reported  more  couple  visiting, 
and only 23  per cent reported decreases for both types of visiting. 
The changes go  hand in hand;  those who visited neighbors more 
also  visited couples  more,  and  vice  versa.  In some  instances,  the 
reduction was  due  to  the  fading of novelty and  the departure of 
favorite  neighbors,  but  the  greatest  reductions  between  inter-
views,  in both kinds of visiting,  took place among low-status peo-
ple and  mixed-marriage  partners;  the  greatest  increases,  among 
people of middle  status and  organization  members.  Compatibil-
ity or lack of it is still the significant source of change. 

Compatibility  and  the  population  mix  which  creates  it  are 
usually  found  in  the  suburbs,  but are  not  uniquely  suburban; 
they occur  in all  new settlements,  even  in  the city,  because  they 
bring together  homogeneous  young  people. 18  Consequently,  the 
increase  in social  life cannot be ascribed as  much  to suburbia as 
to  newness  and  to  the  desire  for  sociability  among  residents.111 
Nevertheless,  neither friendliness  nor  the  population  mix are a 
result of newness per se, for as  long as  people remain compatible, 
and  compatible  people  remain  in  the  community,  visiting  will 
not be reduced by the mere aging of the community, but only by 
the development of population turnover-and incompatibility-
over time.20 

Organizational Participation 

I  turn  now  to  behavior changes not discussed  previously,  and 
will  describe  both  the  changes  and  their  sources.  One  of  the 
most  frequently  reported  changes  was  an  increase  in  organiza-
tional activity:  53  per cent of the random sample and 44 per cent 
of the Philadelphia sample considered themselves more active  in 
secular and church-related organizations (not including churches) 
than  in  the  former  residence.  Altogether,  73  per  cent  in 
both  samples  belonged  to  local  groups.  though  almost  three 
fifths  of  all  memberships  were  in  churches  and  church-related 

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

ones only,  and just  30  per cent  (in  both  samples)  belonged  to a 
secular organization. The rise in activity was as  high  among peo-
ple  who  described  themselves  as  particularly  active  in  their 
former residence as  among the rest.21  True to expectations,  high-
status people  reported  increased  activity  most  often,  but  half  of 
the  low-status  respondents  were  more  active  than  before,  par-
ticularly in religious groups. The desire to meet people, the avaii-
ability  of  more  spare  time,  and  the  need  to  join  PTA  or  the 
church because children were old enough to be in school  or Sun-
day  school  were  the  prime  reasons  for  stepped-up  membership, 
although a  fifth  of the more active also said  they wanted "to be  a 
part of the community" or were persuaded by friends and neigh-
bors to help out by joining. 

A  slight  majority  of  the  random  sample,  58  per cent,  was  in· 
tended  joiners,  but  the  proportions  varied  by  type  of  organiza-
tion.22  Intended memberships reflected personal  or family  needs, 
leading people  into church,  PTA,  or Scout  groups;  unintended 
ones  implied  a  greater  involvement  in  community  affairs.  Sev-
enty  per  cent  of  memberships  in  churches  or  church-related 
groups were  intended,  but only 22  per cent of those  in civic  and 
service  clubs,  and  none  in  social,  political,  and cultural  groups. 
Indeed,  unintended activity was  usually stimulated from outside 
the  home,  58  per  cent  of  the  respondents  indicating  they  had 
been asked  to join by a  neighbor or a  canvasser,  and  14  per cent, 
because  they had seen  the group's announcement  in  the  paper.23 
Unintended  members  had  also  been  less  active  in  their  former 
communities. 

The high  proportion  of  intended  joining suggests  that  Levit· 
town's  impact  on  organizational  activity  was  hardly  universal. 24 
The intended  joiners were  most  interested  in  meeting new  peo-
ple or providing for their children, neither of which factors could 
be considered specific  to  Levittown,  but the  unintended  joiners 
came also  because  they were asked,  responding  to  the communi-
ty's newness,  to the need of organizations to enroll  members, and 
to  people's  desire  to  belong  to  the  community  in  some  way.  If 
suburbia per se  encouraged organizational activity,  however,  one 
would have expected former city residents to be more active  than 
former suburbanites (which  was not the case)  and also  that  there 
would  be  an  increase  in  activity  over  time.  The latter did  take 
place,  because of the scarcity of groups at the  time of the first  in-
terview;  even so,  30 per cent who had been  members at the time 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

of  that  interview  had  dropped  out  by  the  second  interview. 25  A 
quarter  of  the  dropouts  could  not  get  along  with  their  fellow 
members;  the  rest  left because  family  obligations  of one kind  or 
another were more important to  them. 

Religious Attendance 

Although  suburbia  has allegedly  brought about a  religious re-
vival,  only a  third of the  Levittowners reported increased church 
or synagogue attendance  after the move, and close  to  6o  per cent 
said  no  change  had  taken  place. 26  If suburbia  were  responsible 
for  the  rise,  former  city  dwellers  should  have  reported  more  at-
tendance,  but  as  Table  7  indicates,  increased  attendance  was 
about the same for  both samples,  and the Philadelphians actually 
experienced  a  greater  decrease  in  attendance  than  the  random 
sample.  Although  this could  mean  that  the move  to  the suburbs 
discourages  religiosity,  it  is  actually  a  result  of relaxed  parental 
ties,  for  Philadelphians who had lived with parents or in-laws re-
port considerably  more  decrease  than  others.27 

If suburbia were the source of change, it should have been uni-
form  for  all  religions,  but  in  both  samples,  Jews  increased  their 
attendance  most  often  and  Catholics  the  least.  In  the  random 
sample,  14  per cent of the Catholics and all of the Jews now wor-
shipped  more  often,  and  none  of  them  worshipped  less  often. 
Twenty-nine  per  cent  of  the  Protestants  also  worshipped  more 
often, but  17  per cent, less  often.28  Catholic stability is explained 
by  the  compulsory  nature  of  attendance,  but  among  other  reli-
gious groups,  changes  reflect  the  impact of  the community-par-
ticularly  the  intensity  of  church  organization.  Jews  responded 
less  to  religion  than  to  the  ethnic  subcommunity,  and  Jewish 
women,  who  were  more  active  in  it,  reported  a  higher  increase 
in attendance than men. 29  On the other hand, Catholic men were 
more active than women  in  their church, and  their  Mass  attend-
ance  rose  more  than  their  wives'.  The  previously  noted  mar-
ginality  of  mixed-marriage  partners  manifests  itself  again;  they 
reported  the smallest increase and  the largest decrease  in  church 
attendance. 30 

The role  of  the  community comes  through  clearly  in  the  rea-
sons Jews and Protestants give for increasing worship. Among the 
former,  the search for friends,  the need to  have  the children edu-
cated in Jewish ways, and the adult desire to be part of the Jewish 
subcommunity  were  mentioned  in  equal  numbers.  As  one  re-

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

spondent summarized  it,  "To be honest,  it's  partly social.  There 
is  a  moral  responsibility to make a  good synagogue and to  have a 
Sunday school  for  the children, but it's also  for affairs and activi-
ties."  "Belonging"  was  most  important  to  former  city  dwellers, 
and  in  the  words  of  one,  "In  New  York,  [religious  observance] 
was  only for  the very old and the very religious.  Here you  get an 
identity  and  you  flock  to  your  own  kind."  While  most  Jews 
would  eventually  have  joined a  synagogue  to  educate  their chil-
dren,  living  among  non-Jews  hurried  the  process  and  produced 
an  unintended effect of the move  to  Levittown.  That  the search 
is  for ethnic cohesion rather than religiosity is  brought out by the 
fact  that  none  of  the  Jews  with  Christian  spouses  reported  in-
creased  synagogue  attendance. 

Protestants  stressed  even  more  that  "it's  for  the  children's 
sake," and "to be a  part of the community." They do not see  the 
community  as  a  group  of  fellow  religionists,  however,  but  as  a 
place  in  which  to  settle  down.  One  pointed  out,  "We are  active 
in  the  community,  so  we  should  be  active  in  church  too."  A 
former  tenant  explained  his  failure  to  go  to  church  before  he 
moved  to  Levittown  by  saying,  "Apartment  living  is  not  con-
ducive  to  churchgoing;  you  are  withdrawn  into  yourself,  you 
don't  do  as  many  things."  In  fact,  former  apartment-dwelling 
Protestants  in  both  samples  increased  their  church  attendance 
more  than  row  house  or  single-family  home  occupants,  and 
former  city  dwellers  more  than  suburbanites.31  Among  Phila-
delphia Protestants, but no others,  higher church attendance was 
also  associated  with  increased  visiting,  suggesting that the church 
helped  integrate them  into social  life--or vice versa. 32  Purely so-
cial  motives  for  church  attendance  were  rare,  however,  only  20 
per cent of Protestant friendships  being made in church, as  com-
pared  to  42  per  cent  among  Jews. 88  My  hunch  is  that  Protes-
tants  who  felt  themselves  part of  the  community  were  more  ac-
tive  religiously and socially,  whereas  those left out of it were  less 
active. 

For  these  Protestants and almost all  Jews,  the  suburban  move 
brought  about  greater  religious  participation,  but  it  had  differ-
ent meanings and sources for each.  Both attended partly for  their 
children's  sake  and  for  social  reasons,  but  the  Protestants  were 
impelled  principally  by  home  ownership,  the  Jews  by  ethnic 
needs  heightened  by  the  population  mix.  In  neither  case  was 
there any evidence of a  religious revival, however.  Nor do people 

•  266  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

attend  more  often  for  social  than  for  theological  reasons  since 
they  moved  to  the  suburbs,  although  I  doubt  that  they  were  as 
theologically  inclined  in  the  city  and  in  the  fabled  past  as  is 
sometimes claimed. 

Political Party  Shifts 

Suburbs  are  often  reputed  to  turn  Democrats  into  Republi-
cans,  but  in  Levittown,  only  about  a  fifth  of  the  voters  have 
changed  parties,  many  of  them  Democrats  who  became  inde-
pendents, "voting for  the man, not the party." Among the Phila-
delphians,  21  per  cent  of  former  Democrats,  1 o  per  cent  of 
former  Republicans,  and  22  per cent of former  independents re-
ported  changing  their  party  preference  after  moving  to  Levit· 
town. 34  The changers  were  more often  high-status  people  (none 
of  the  low-status  respondents  gave  up  their  prior  party  alle-
giance) and of all religions;  however,  Irish Catholics-in political 
transition all  over the country--changed  parties twice as  often  as 
all  other  ethnic  groups.  Four  of  the  six  previous  Democrats 
became  independents  and  two  became  Republicans;  two  pre-
vious  independents  and  a  Republican  were  now  voting  Demo-
cratic.  The  numbers  are  minuscule,  but  they  do  not  indicate  a 
shift  to  Republicanism. 35  Indeed,  they  suggest  that  class,  not 
party,  is  the crucial  factor.  Three middle class  Irish  residents  in-
dicated  that they were no longer voting for  the Democratic party 
but for  the man, whereas a working class  Protestant, traditionally 
Republican,  chose  the  Democrats  in  Levittown  because  she  felt 
closer  to  them.  Insofar  as  the  move  itself  was  an  expression  of 
aspirations  for  social  mobility,  the  change  in  voting  is  a  by-
product  rather  than  an  effect  of  the  move,  the  equivalent of an 
intended rather than an unintended change. If Levittown had an 
impact,  it  was  to  provide  people  from  Philadelphia  (then  virtu-
ally  a  one-party  city)  with  more  choice  among  parties  and  the 
opportunity,  as  independents,  to  free  themselves  of  party  al-
legiance.  Only time will  tell,  however, whether this is  an effect of 
suburbia,  or  only  of  the  newness  of  the  community,  that  is,  an 
expression  of  the desire  to  postpone a  choice  until  party  images 
have stabilized. 

Despite  their new  status  as  tax-paying home  owners  and  tht>ir 
better  opportunity  to  get  to  know  the  candidates,  the  Philadel-
phians  did  not  vote  in  larger  numbers  after  moving  to  Levit-
town.  Indeed,  only  2  per  cent  reported  not  voting  in  Philadel-

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

phia elections, and 5  per cent in  Levittown.  The two  Levittown 
elections  about  which  respondents  were  reporting  both  drew  a 
turnout of go  per cent of registered voters,  but in later elections, 
the  percentages dropped to 71,  63,  and  77  respectively.  It seems 
doubtful, then,  that  the move  to  the  suburbs increased voter  in-
terest, and a  telephone survey I  conducted the day after the  1960 
election  indicated  that many  had  already forgotten  the name  of 
their  candidate-even  though  (or,  perhaps,  because)  it  was 
Smith. Individual Levittowners did, however, develop an interest 
in  politics for  the first  time  in Levittown, and  became active  be-
cause  the smallness of the community put them in direct contact 
with politicians." 

Spare-Time,  Leisure,  and  Consumption  Styles 

Although  the  critics  argue  that suburban living deprives peo-
ple of spare time, and 56 per cent of the random sample of Levit-
towners agreed,  35  per cent found  they had more time now;  only 
9 per cent indicated that no change had taken  place (less than for 
any  other  item  in the  interview  schedule).  Women  had  slightly 
less  time  now  than  men,  childless  couples  reported  no  change, 
and  those  with  one  or  two  children  also  had  less.  Fully  83  per 
cent of families with four or more children reported an  increase, 
however,  so  that  becoming  a  parent and  the  children's  ages  are 
probably  more  important  determinants  of  spare-time  change 
than any other factor. 87  Indeed,  the women  give  this as  the  prin-
cipal  reason.  Those  with  children  of  school  age  now  had  more 
time;  those  whose  babies  had  reached  the  "active"  stage,  less. 
Most  who  had  previously  been  tenants  also  reported  less  spare 
time,  but  there was  no difference  between  urban  and  suburban 
residents,  indicating  that  home  ownership,  not  the  community, 
creates the impact. The new house was also  the second  major rea-
son given for change;  some women found  it easier to take care of, 
but  an  equal  number  said  it  took  more  time.  The  journey  to 
work did  not cut  into men's  sp~re time,  but among the  women, 
the  longer  the  husband's  trip,  the more  who  reported  decreased 
spare time. The men said  that job 1:hange was  more significant;  a 
new job might take longer or shorter hours. 

Change in the kinds of leisure activit;es  pursued is  reported al-
most as  often as  time change (by 71  per cent of the  respondents). 
Forty-two  per  cent  of  the  women  indulge  in  more  social  and 
game activities,  mostly card playing,  2 1  per cent mention a  shift 

•  268  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

to  work around the  house and yard,  and  16  per cent to organiza-
tional  participation.  Among the men,  70  per cent have  taken  up 
house and yard work. All other changes are numerically insignifi-
cant.  As  might  be  expected,  83  per  cent  of  people  with  more 
spare  time mention activity changes,  but so  did  68  per cent with 
less  time,  demonstrating that activity change has  little to do with 
available  time.  Some  women  organized  their  housework  more 
efficiently  now,  partly  because  social  opportunities  and  higher 
morale encouraged them  to  alter  the daily  routine  to leave  time 
for  other  activities.  For most  people,  however,  new  pursuits  are 
either  required  or  facilitated  by  the  move,  and  their  effect  on 
spare  time  is  a  matter  of  personal  definilion,  those  disliking  the 
new activity finding that it cuts into their spare time. 

Care of the yard is  obligatory, and the work must be done dur-
ing  spare  time.  Whether  gardening  deprives  people  of  leisure 
hours  depends  on  how  they  feel  about  it.  One  man  said  sadly, 
"The  house  takes  priority  over  fishing,  boating,  and  hunting; 
I've  sold  my  boat,"  but another said,  "It's all  lawn  now.  I  don't 
do  as  much  reading;  I  have  no  time.  It doesn't  bother  me;  my 
mind  is  more  occupied  here,  I  have  more  ambition  and  I  am 
more active around  the  house."  For the  large majority,  however, 
gardening  takes  away  spare  time,  for  77  per  cent  of  those  who 
identify house and yard work as  the principal activity change also 
say  they have less spare time.  Other activity changes, for example, 
more  visiting,  do  not cut  into  it. 88  For  example,  40  per cent of 
the  residents--men  (who  do  most  of  the  yard  work)  as  often  as 
women-found time  to  add  new magazines  to  their reading fare 
the first  year.  New magazines are  taken  most  often  by  those  who 
do  less  visiting,  although  not  by  those  who  are  more  bored  in 
Levittown  than  they  were  before,  but  then  they  are  usually 
poorly  educated  people  who  do  not  read  much.  Moreover,  low-
status respondents  report  both  the  least  activity  change  and also 
the  greatest  loss  in  spare  time,  indicating  that  the  yard  may  be 
more of a chore for them than for anyone else. 

The move from  city to suburb has had considerable impact on 
leisure  time and activity,  for  93  per cent of former city residents 
report  changes  in  both.39  Although  former  apartment  dwellers 
and  tenants  indicate  more change  than  former  homeowners,  the 
move  from  city  to  suburb  is  the  crucial  one,  for  regardless  of 
house  type,  previous  urbanites  report  change  more  often  than 
suburbanites,  at least  in  activities. 40  (If gardening were  the  only 

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

innovation,  the  change  in  house  type  would  have  been  a  more 
significant  source,  but  former  city  dwellers  also  experienced  in-
creased  social  life  and  organizational  activity,  which  are  related 
to  the change  in settlement  type.)  In  any case,  their leisure  pur-
suits  have  been  transformed  by the move,  although  some change 
may disappear  as  the novelty of house and community wears  off. 
Since working in the yard and making new friends were included 
among aspirations before the move,  the new activities were an in-
tended change for many. 

If the  suburban  critics are  right,  increased  spare  time and  ac-
tivity change should lead to more boredom, and bored Levittown-
ers  should  have  tried  activity  change  to  cut  down  ennui  more 
than others.  None of these predictions came to pass,  however,  for 
the  proportion  bored  at  least  once  a  month  is  the  same  among 
people with  more and with  less  spare  time  (20  per cent),  and no 
Levittowner with added  spare  time  is  more  bored  than  before.41 
Likewise,  boredom  is  not  associated  with  activity cJ:tange;  three 
fourths  of the  bored  have  taken  on  new  leisure  pursuits,  but so 
have  two  thirds of those  who are not bored.  Neither leisure-time 
change  nor activity change seems  to  have  any effect on  boredom. 
Changes  in  leisure  styles  seemed  minimal,  for  as  I  noted 
earlier, the Levittowners were not given  to partying, and judging 
from  my  own  visiting,  the  higher  alcohol  consumption  and  the 
accompanying shift from  beer to cocktails attributed to suburbia 
did not take place.42  Sunday afternoon trips  to parks and beaches 
became rarer, for  the greenery in the backyard and  the neighbor-
hood  pools  provided  satisfactory  substitutes  within  easy  access 
and  some  people  took  to  inspecting other  new  housing develop-
ments  in  the  area.  Except  among  the  children,  going  to  the 
movies  became  an  unusual  occurrence,  even  though  Levittown 
eventually  had  two  movie  theaters,  for  television  offered  a  more 
easily  accessible  and  cheaper  substitute.  Going  out  for  dinner, 
particularly  on  weekend  nights,  may  have  increased  somewhat. 
Sometimes dining out was with other couples;  more often it was a 
family affair to give the children a  treat and relieve the housewife 
of  the  cooking  chore.  Like  other  suburbanites,  however,  Levit-
towners  soon  built  backyard  patios,  and  took  to  having outdoor 
barbecues,  quite  regularly  for  the  family  and  occasionally  for 
friends. 

Thirty per cent of the  random  sample  and  25  per cent of  the 
city  sample  also  responded  positively  to  a  question,  asked  of 

•  270  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

women,  whether "there had been any change  in  the style  of fur-
niture liked  best after moving to  Levittown."  Fifty-four per cent 
had  shifted  from  modern  to  traditional,  15  per cent  from  tradi-
tional  to  modern,  and  the  rest,  from  one  type  of  traditional  or 
modern  to  another.4 3  The  principal  impetus  was  the  pseudo-
Colonial  fa~ade of  the  Levitt  house,  and  70  per  cent  of  those 
changing  to  traditional  furniture  chose  "Early  American."  As 
one woman said, "If the house had been Oriental, we would have 
bought  bamboo."  Others  cited  personal  esthetic  preferences  or 
:he  greater  comfort  of  traditional  styles,  and  some  ascribed  the 
shift  to  increasing  maturity.  "Being  young,  we  liked  modern 
first,"  one explained. There was no relation between style change 
and  income,  class,  or  even  age.  Former  urbanites  shifted  more 
often,  but former renters, who would be most  likely  to buy new 
furniture while moving, changed more often than former owners 
only  in  the  random  sample  group.  The changers  seemed  to  be 
people dissatisfied with their life before Levittown, because those 
bored  in  the  previous  residence  and  those  wanting  to  make 
changes  in  their way  of living before arrival  were  more likely  to 
adopt  new  styles.  Being  bored  in  Levittown  did  not  correlate 
with change, however, and people with  improved morale chose a 
new  furniture  style  more  often  than  unhappy  ones.  Evidently, 
the  desire  for  change  preceded  Levittown,  although  the  actual 
change  took  place  afterwards,  the  stimulus  for  the  new  style 
preference often coming from  neighbors,  people liking the styles 
they saw when they went visiting. 44 

Without a  study of  the  distribution  of furniture  styles  in  the 
community it is  not possible to say  whether the changes were im-
pelled by Levitt's houses,  by the neighbors, or by personal prefer-
ence}~ Undoubtedly,  the Colonial  style of the  house made Early 
American furniture seem most relevant to those already consider-
ing  change,  but  then  Levitt  himself  had  adoptt:d  the  Colonial 
style  while  completing  Levittown,  Pennsylvania,  and  both  he 
and his customers were probably responding to a nationwide im-
pulse  that  h~d nothing  to  do  with  the  new  Levittown.  Since 
modern style is associated with youth and traditional is associated 
with  maturity and  residential  stability,  the  preference  for  Colo-
nial  design  may  well  be  a  function  of  the desire  to settle down, 
interpreted  as  a  return  to  traditional  values.  Why  some  other 
eighteenth  or  nineteenth  century  style  was  not  chosen  is  prob-
ably explained by  the high  status associated  with Colonial  archi-

tecture and furniture and with  its symbolism of rural  and small-
town America. These associations must not be exaggerated,  how-
ever,  for  the  majority  of  Levittowners  seemed  content  to  live 
with  the  furniture  style  they  had brought with  them  from  their 
previous residence. 

Attitudes Toward  Suburbs  and Cities 

Living in  Levittown altered people's attitudes toward both the 
community and  the  city.  The random  sample  was  asked  in  two 
interviews how they liked living in Levittown;  the majority liked 
it "very much"  both  times,  none disliked  it,  and  only a  handful 
were  ambivalent. 48  Even  so,  a  third  changed  their  opinions  be-
tween  interviews,  II  per cent being more pleased at the later in-
terview  than  before,  23  per  cent  less.  The  major  complaints, 
each  voiced  by a  quarter of  the  complainants,  were  rising  taxes, 
lack  of  public  transportation  within  Levittown  and  to  the  city, 
and  lot  size  or  lack  of  fences.  The  last-named  complaints  ex-
pressed  the  wish  of  some  to  be  separated  from  incompatible 
neighbors or desire for more acreage and the status that goes with 
it.47 

Attitude  changes  over  time  are  reflected  in  future  moving 
plans.  After  two  to  three  years  in  Levittown,  most  respond'e~ts 
still  want to stay and only a  fifth  have changed their minds-not--1 
all  of  them  to  leave.  In  the  random  sample  group,  about  three 
fourths  planned  to  stay  and  the  rest  to  leave;  a  total  of  I7  per 
cent had changed their original intent, 7 per cent to settle,  10 per 
cent  to  move.48  When  the  Philadelphians  first  came  to  Levit-
town,  half said  they  planned  to settle,  20  per cent  to  move,  and 
30  per  cent  were  undecided.49  Three  years  later,  63  per  cent 
planned  to settle,  33  per cent to move,  and 4  per cent were still 
undecided.~0  Most  of  the  initially  uncertain  now  want  to  leave, 
but of the rest, only 21  per cent had changed their minds,  14 per 
cent to move,  7 per cent to stay.  Older, lower-status  people were 
more  likely  to  settle,  younger,  ~igher-status ones  to  leave.  The 
latter want "a bigger and better house," or "a community that is 
not  a  development"-that  is,  a  more  settled  suburban  town  of 
higher income and status.  For most Mobiles,  living in Levittown 
has not altered aspirations for a  "better" suburb, but since  these 
existed before arrival, neither has it created them. 

Although no one planned  to return  to the city,  65  per cent of 
the women  in  the  Philadelphia sample and half the men  missed 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

it.  These  people  fall  into  three  types. 51  Well-educated,  city-bred 
women  (many  of  them  Jewish)  miss  its  downtown  cultmal  and 
shopping  facilities.  Low-status  couples 
(particularly  Italian 
women)  miss  people  in  the  old  neighborhood  and  downtown 
shops.  Men,  principally blue collar workers,  miss  trips  that com-
bined shopping and visiting. 52  Fifty-seven  per cent of the women 
and  25  per cent of the men, usually  the less  educated, missed  the 
old  neighborhood. 53  No  ethnic  or  religious  group  stood  out, 
however.  The  neighborhood  was  missed  for  its  people,  88  per 
cent  pointing  to  relatives,  neighbors,  and  friends  in  that  order; 
and 6  per cent,  for  the  neighborhood  church.  Thirteen per cent 
who came  to  Levittown  from  apartments missed  them  now,  and 
27  per  cent  missed  their  former  row  house.  None  of  the  men 
missed  the apartment, but women  recalled less  housework  there; 
a  thi~d of the men and  20 per cent of the women missed the row 
house, primarily because of lower heat bills.M 

None  of  the  Philadelphians  who  missed  the  city  wished  to 
move back,  but 59 per cent of the women in the sample said they 
would  like  to  live  in  the  city  "were  it  not for  the  children,"  al-
most  three  times  as  many  as  the  23  per cent  who  had  answered 
the  same  question  on  the  mail  questionnaire  before  coming  to 
Levittown.  (Among men,  the  proportion  increased only from  23 
per cent to  29.)  By and large,  the women who would now choose 
the city  if they  were childless  included, as  before,  the young,  the 
well-educated,  Jews,  and  Italians,  but  they  have  been  joined  by 
additional  well-educated  women,  high  school  dropouts,  partners 
in  mixed  marriages,  and  women  who  lived  with  parents  or  in-
laws  before  Levittown. 55  Some  were,  once  again,  the  socially 
isolated  and  extruded,  but  not  all,  for  there  was  no  association 
between boredom or loneliness in Levittown and wanting to live 
in the city. 56 

Of  course,  the  interview  question  about  a  return  to  the  city 
was  hypothetical,  and  answers  tapped  the shortcomings of  Levit-
town and an image of life without children rather than any great 
yearning  for  the  city.  As  a  result,  reasons  for  the  choice  corre-
spond  closely  to  answers  to  a  question  on  what  urban  facilities 
were wanted in Levittown-better transportation to the city, and 
more  stores,  entertainment,  and  cultural  facilities. 57  The  image 
of life  without children  came  through  in  choosing where  to live 
in  the city.  A  few  had dreams of urbane luxury, picking a  River-
side  Drive  apartment  in  New  York  City  or  a  town  house  in 

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

•  273  • 

downtown San  Francisco;  others saw  the move as  an escape  from 
housework and a  chance  to have more free  time.  Accordingly,  55 
per cent of the respondents  opted  for  an  apartment,  14  per cent 
for a  town  house (all  of them women), and  the remaining 31  per 
cent  for  another  singJe.family  house.  But the  same  impulse  that 
brought  Philadelphians  out  to  the  suburbs  in  the  first  place  re-
asserted  itself  in  their  locating  of  these  hypothetical  residences; 
58  per cent  (63  per  cent  of  the  women)  wanted  to  live  in  the 
outer parts of the city and only 42  per cent chose downtown.  Per-
haps  the  typical  response  was  given  by  one  woman:  "a  luxury 
apartment, but not in center city."  The people who rejected  the 
city even without children  preferred the  lack of  congestion,  out-
door living,  fresh  air, and  the  peace and quiet of the suburbs. 

Even  the  teenagers,  whom  I  had  expected  to  be  urbanites,  do 
not want to live in  the city. They miss downtown movie theaters, 
but  previous  city  dwellers  among  them  are  only  slightly  more 
discontented  with  Levittown  than  the  rest. 58  The  adolescents' 
complaints  about  Levittown  (other  than  "nothing  to  do")  re-
sembled  those  of  the  critics  and  reflected  the  adult suburbanity 
they  hope  to achieve.  The few  teenagers  who commented on  the 
community  were  unhappy  about  the  look-alike  quality  of  the 
houses and the rule against ferrces.  Like their parents-but unlike 
the  critics-some  wanted  lower  densities  and  larger  lots;  one 
tenth-grade girl said,  "I would like to  have a  big yard when I  get 
married,  because I  don't wish  the  neighbors  to hear my husband 
and me fighting." 

To test  attitudes  about  the  house,  suburbia,  and  the city  fur-
ther,  the  random  sample  was  asked  to  choose  between  its  Levitt 
house  and a  hypothetical  ideal  row  house  resembling  the  Levitt 
house  in  a  Levittown-like  community:  if  the  community  were 
only fifteen  minutes from  the  husband's job;  if it were a  similar 
distance from downtown  Philadelphia;  and,  if it were  cheaper.~9 
Although many planners argue  that  the  row  house  is  the answer 
to urban sprawl, and some predict it must become the major sub-
urban  building  type during  the  next housing  boom, most  Levit-
towners  were  not  interested.  Altogether,  22  per  cent  chose  the 
row  house at least once,  but no one for.  the  house itself.  Nine per 
cent picked  it to reduce  the  man's  journey to work-all of them 
women;  7  per cent,  to  be  cleser  to  downtown  facilities,  and  14 
per  cent,  if  it  were  at  least  $woo-2ooo  cheaper. 60  But  most 
would not take  the house  at any  price.  "You'd  have  to give  it to 

•  274  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

me,"  said  one.  "I  figure  I'm  going  to  be ninety  when  I  pay  off 
this mortgage," said another,  "and I  might as  well  go first  class." 
Even  those  who  chose  the  row  house  said  they did  not  want  to 
live  in one, and their choices really reflected dissatisfactions with 
Levittown. 61  The  common  and  almost  universal  objection  was 
lack  of  privacy.  One  Le'<'ittowner  explained,  "In  a  row  house, 
you  hear everybody's  troubles.  You  are always  hearing the other 
person's  business  and  fighting  about  how  much  of  the  lawn  and 
driveway  is  yours.  You  spend  too  much  time  with  your  ear 
against  the  wall."  Freedom  from  the  supervision  and  judgment 
of  adjacent  neighbors  (and  from  the  temptation  to  judge  them) 
are  more  important  than  easier  access  to  job  or city.  Unless  fu· 
ture  row  houses  are designed  to  maximize  privacy,  and  can also 
overcome  their  present  low·status  image,  they  will  not  be  very 
popular with the next generation of home buyers. 62 

Levittown  has  undoubtedly  made  an  impact  on  people's  atti-
tudes, creating more favorable opinions toward the city than they 
held  before.  Even  so,  these  reflect  Levittown's drawbacks,  partic-
ularly  poor  transportation  to  the  city,  rather  than  an  endorse-
ment  of  city  living.  Most  Levittowners  would  probably  move 
into a  house  in  a  low-density,  suburban-like area  in  or  near  the 
center of  the city,  provided  it cost  no more  than  what  they now 
pay.  However, since  this is  out of the question, and the city does 
not lure them in the first  place, they would gladly settle for more 
urban  facilities  and conveniences  in suburbia.  It may  be prema-
ture to expect urban enthusiasm from a population just two years 
in  its  new  suburban  home,  but  judging  by  the  pleasure  which 
older Levittowners found  in their houses,  I  doubt whether many 
young couples  will  consider a  return  to  the city  once  their chil-
dren  have  grown  up,  particularly as  the  house  is  then  just paid 
for. 

DOES SUBURBIA CHANGE PEOPLE? 

The  welter  of  statistics  suggests  that  the  move  to  the  suburb 
and  to  a  new  community changes  some  people,  but  not  in  uni-
form  ways.  Church  attendance  may  go  up  but  it  may  also  go 
down, and often  it remains as  it was  before.  The most frequently 
reported changes are not caused by the suburbs,  but were reasons 
for  going there  in  the first  place.  A smaller proportion are,  how-
ever,  unintended results of the move-some good, some bad. 

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

•  275  • 

Some  people  change more  beyond  the  city limits  than  others. 
Women,  particularly  former  urban  ones,  experience  the  most 
changes,  as  well  as  the  most  unintended  changes  and  the  most 
undesirable  ones.  So  do  people  of least and  most status and  edu-
cation, young  people entering a  new  familial  role,  and of course 
the socially isolated.  Urban  men,  former  tenants,  the people who 
share  the  dominant  culture  of  the  new  community,  and  more 
generally,  the  majority  of  all  who  reported  changes,  experience 
desired and desirable changes. 

Good or bad,  many changes  have nothing to do with  the move 
but are related  to  factors  of age,  sex,  class  and ethnic culture,  or 
occupation.  Others  are  produced  by  the  community's  newness 
and  will  erode  over  time.  The new  house  and  home  ownership 
create  more  change  than  tlie  community;  except  for  the  physi-
cally  isolated  housewife,  the woman who  misses  her parents, and 
the congenital  urbanite,  the  important move  is  not  from  city  to 
suburb but from  one population mix.  to another.  In fact,  hetero-
geneity-even  in  the supposedly  homogeneous  suburb-is prob-
ably  the major source of  unintended change  experienced  by  the 
Levittowners. 

As  I  suggested before,  Levittown's population mix is  typical of 
new suburbs, but can also be found in other new settlements, and 
changes in population mix face  many people who move.  Usually, 
movers pick a new residence with some knowledge of the popula-
tion mix, either "to be with the same kinds of people," or to have 
"better"  neighbors.  People  in  a  new  community,  like  those 
forced  to  relocate  by  urban  renewal,  lack  this  choice,  but while 
the  latter  often  suffer  as  a  result,  most  Levittowners  did  not. 
Critics  who  think  they  should  have  suffered  are  only  drawing 
conclusions about how they, as  upper middle class cosmopolitans, 
would feel  in  a  lower  middle class,  local,  and home-centered  en-
vironment.  Undoubtedly  they  would  have  been  depressed, 
bored,  and  lonely  in  Levittown-but  then,  Levittowners  would 
have  felt  the same way  if  they had moved  into the critics' midst. 
Although  I  have emphasized the changes,  the statistics also  in-
dicate  that  people's  lives  were  not  significantly  altered  by  the 
move.  As  Table 7  shows, 'the  "no  change"  percentage  is  usually 
the  largest.  Suburbia  allowed  people  to  live  more  comfortably 
and  feel  better,  which  is  what  they  wanted.  Some  participated 
more (or less)  in various aspects  of community life,  but the basic 
patterns  of  life  in  the  family,  in  the  home,  and  on  the  job  re-

•  :q6  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

mained  much  the  same,  and  the routines and  problems  of  daily 
existence  were  not  affected.  One  Levittowner  summarized  it 
well:  "I don't know how a new house changes your life. You  have 
a  pattern you go by, and that stays the same  no matter where you 
live."  The conclusion  I  reached  in  Part  One of this  book  about 
the new community  thus also  applies  to  individuals:  both  carry 
on old ways  in a new setting. 

These findings corroborate other studies.  For example,  Berger 
discovered  that a  group of factory  workers  held  to  their working 
class  ways  of living  when  they  bought  homes  in  a  new  tract  in 
suburban Milpitas, California, and remained steadfastly immune 
to both middle class  and suburban styles which they should have 
adopted  had  they  lived  up  to  what  he  calls  the  "suburban 
myth." 63  He  also  found  that  the  move  had  not  engendered  as-
pirations for occupational  or social mobility, either for the adults 
or  for  their  children,  but  had  provided  them-like  the  Levit-
towners-with  a  "new  feeling  of  well-being." 64  Wilner  and  his 
associates,  who studied a group of slum dwellers after their move 
into  a  new  public  housing  project,  discovered  the  same  thing: 
people  felt  better,  but  had  not  developed  new  aspirations  for 
work, children's education, or home ownership. 85 

Like my  interviews,  both  these studies  were conducted  two  to 
three  years  after  the move,  but Willmott  reported  that  the  peo-
ple of Dagenham, a  municipal housing project on the outskirts of 
London,  maintained  their working class  ways  during the  twenty 
to  forty  years  since  they  had" left  the  slums  of  that  city.  Some 
critics  have suggested  that the real  impact of the suburban move 
can  only  be  seen  in  the  next  generation,  and  that  the  children 
will  either  want  to  escape,  or  will  show  the  deleterious  conse-
quences  of  suburbia  when  they  grow  up.  In  Dagenham,  only  a 
few  of the second generation wanted to leave;  28  per cent of the 
original  settlers  reported  that  married  children  had  remained, 
and  that many others would  have  if housing had  been  available. 
Willmott also  found  that at least a  third of  those who left would 
have  preferred  to  stay  in  Dagenham.86  Some  did  move  out  vol-
untarily,  however,  having  adopted  middle  class  life  styles.  An 
American study, by Zelan,  found  that graduate sludents raised in 
the  suburbs  did  not  differ  in  intellectual  interests  from  those 
raised  in  the city,  casting doubt  on  the charges  that a  suburban 
childhood  leads to intellectual  debility.67

TilE  SOURCES  OF  IMPACT 

To understand  Levittown's  impact  on  its  residents,  the  sources 
which  do and do  not  bring about behavior and  attitude change 
must be catalogued.  Knowing these sources allows  the planner or 
policy  maker  (I  will  use  these  terms  interchangeably  here)  68  to 
develop  plans  that  will  achieve  the  intended  goal.  The  sources 
can  be  classified  into  pre-occupancy  aspirations,  post-occupancy 
conditions,  and  extra-community  conditions.  Among  post-oc-
cupancy  conditions,  of  most  concern  to  the  planner  whose 
arena  is  the community,  are:  ( 1)  the  house  (and  the  move  from 
apartment  to  house);  (2)  the  settlement  type  (and  the  move 
from  city  to  suburb); 69  (3)  the  community  layout;  (4)  com-
munity  facilities,  public  and  commercial;  (5)  and  the  low 
density.  (These  five  sources  encompass  the  physical  characteris-
tics  of  the  community.)  The  social  characteristics  include:  (6) 
the population  mix and  (7)  the social  structure or array of com-
munity institutions. An  eighth source,  not directly related  to the 
community,  is  its  newness.  Among extra-community sources  are 
the area housing market, the regional  and national economy, and 
the national social structure and culture. A  policy-oriented analy-
sis  must also  identify spurious sources,  which have nothing to do 
with change. 

The House 

The  single  most  important  source  of  impact  is  undoubtedly 
the house,  even  though most of the changes  it encouraged  in  the 
lives of Levittowners were intended. The house is both a physical 
structure and an owned property. Among its  physical  characteris-
tics,  space  was  the  most  significant  source  of  change,  providing 
easier child-rearing,  more  room  for  family  activities,  and gTeater 
privacy to its members,  thereby reducing  family  friction  and in-
creasing contentment. 70  Modernity  encouraged  improved  house-
keeping  methods  and  allowed  a  bit  more  spare  time  for  wives. 
Both  house  and  yard  offered  opportunities for  initial  fixing  and 
furnishing,  and . also  for  more  lasting  decorating,  hobbies,  and 
other kinds of cultural self-expression.  They also  had unintended 
effects:  more family cohesion and change in spare time and spare-
time activity. 

Contentment results  principally  from  home  ownership,  how-

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

ever,  particularly  among  men.  Aside  from  the  acquisition  of 
property and  its  monetary value,  ownership  brings  the freedom 
to do as one pleases and to indulge in forms of self-expression in-
side and  outside  the  house  that are not available  to a  tenant;  it 
permits  or encourages  familial  "settling  down"  and  provides  a 
public  symbol  of  achievement,  "something  to  show  for  all  your 
years  of  living,"  as  one  Levittowner  pointed  out.11  Ownership 
also  incorporates people  into  the  block and gives  some a  feeling 
of community belongingness which  may result in church, organi-
zational,  and  political  participation.  These  changes  last  only  so 
long as  people are satisfied with  the house as a  physical  structure 
and with  the community in which it sits,  and, of course,  they are 
most intense while the house and ownership are novel. 

Settlement  Type:  Suburb and City 

Generally speaking,  the changes  that could  be assigned  to  the 
move  from  city  to  suburb  alone  were  few;  they  came  through 
most clearly in the poorer adaptation of the Philadelphians.  Had 
similar changes  been  reported  by  urbanites  in  the random  sam-
ple,  they could  be  attributed  to  the  change  in  settlement  type, 
but for most Philadelphians it was not the move from city to sub-
urb, but the loss of a  specific set of social  ties located in a specific 
city.  They missed  parents and old friends,  but so did Transients 
who had grown up in small  towns and suburbs from which their 
jobs had taken them. All in all,  the city per se  (and  the leaving of 
it)  had little  impact on  people's live:r--and certainly not enough 
to encourage  them  to go  back  to  it;  the  impact resulted,  rather, 
from  the people they left  behind,  Levittown's shortage of urban 
facilities, and lack of transportation to the city. 

Conversely,  the  move  to  Levittown  as  a  suburban  settlement 
was a more important source of change. One consequence was the 
feeling  of  being stuck,  which  stems  partly  from  the  shortage  of 
commercial  "safety-valve"  areas.  Physical  isolation  is  not limited 
to  suburbia,  however,  for  some  women  were  stuck  in  the  city. 
Sometimes,  the lack  of shopping and window-shopping opportu-
nities  impels  neighb~ring, and  lack  of  entertainment  facilities 
encourages visiting with  other couples.  The discovery  that visit-
ing may  be  preferable to "being out on  the town"  qualifies  as  a 
significant unintended change of suburban living and of commu-
nity newness. 

Another consequence was  the slowdown  in  the  pace  of living, 

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

•  279  • 

noted primarily by former city dwellers and men. It follows  from 
the ability  to  spend  more  time  in  the  house  and  yard,  activities 
for which one can set one's own pace;  the increase in outdoor liv-
ing,  which  may reduce  the energy and desire  to do other things; 
and  the availability  of friendly  people  nearby,  which  eliminates 
visiting that requires  travel.  The men,  who  report  increased  re-
laxation more than women, could avoid  participation in disliked 
parental and  in-law activities and escape  urban congestion.  Both 
sexes  also  called  attention  to  the  satisfactions  of  clean  air  and 
greenery  and  the  safety  of  the  relatively  traffic-free  residential 
neighborhoods.  But despite  the feeling of greater relaxation,  the 
suburbs actually  reduced  spare  time and  caused  a  major change 
in  leisure  activity;  gardening  (whether  it  was  fun  or  drudgery) 
and social  life  replacing some  mass-media  and  urban  diversions. 
Perhaps  the  most  significant  impact  of  the  suburb  was  on 
family finances.  Rising expenditures can be attributed to suburb-
related transportation costs,  higher taxes  (which resulted  primar-
ily  from  community  newness),  to  house-related  expenses  that 
come  with  a  single-family  house  and  home  ownership,  and  to  a 
higher standard of living that was  partly intended, partly a result 
of norms set by the population mix of the community. 

Finally,  the  suburban  location  meant  longer  commuting  for 
some, and was a source (albeit a  minor one)  for  a  variety of con-
sequences.  Short work  trips  provided more  time with  the  family 
and more joint activities, although increased  ones did not reduce 
it,  since  men  took  time  away from  other activities  instead.  Even 
so,  longer commuting did not affect  their spare  time or their so-
cial  and  organizational  activities.  Indeed,  the  main  burden  of 
commuting fell  on  the women;  they reported less  spare time and 
poorer dispositions  when  the man's  trip is  long.  The men  them-
selves were little affected  by trip length, being content so  long as 
they  did  not  have  to  use public  transportation.  Since  most  were 
not faced  with a significantly longer travel  time to work after the 
move, its overall  impact was negligible, and certainly not enough 
to make them unhappy about suburbia. 

Levittown as a Community:  The Physical  Environment 

Levittown  is  also  a  source  of  change  as  a  physical  and  social 
community,  but the various elements of the physical  community 
have  not  produced  a  significant  impact.  Although  they  are  laid 
out  according  to  the  precepts  of  the  traditional  neighborhood 

•  280  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

scheme, the individual neighborhoods do not affect people's lives. 
As  I  noted  earlier,  they  are  too  large  for  social  relations among 
their occupants, too similar to each other to encourage identifica-
tion,  and  without  distinctive  social  or  political  functions  that 
might  spawn  neighborhood  groups.  The  elementary  school,  lo-
cated in the middle of each  neighborhood, has not become a focal 
point.  Although  some atudents  identify  with  their  school,  over-
crowding  has  forced  busing  of  students  across  neighborhood 
lines.  School  meeting rooms  are used  almost every  night,  but by 
community-wide  groups,  not  neighborhood  ones  (except  for  the 
PTA). 

The  neighborhood  pool  is  a  center,  but  because  admission 
cards are issued only to neighborhood residents.  In theory, it pro-
vides  an  opportunity  for  members of  the  same  neighborhood  to 
meet,  but most  people come  to  the pool as  a  family  or in cliques, 
and  there  is  little  incentive  for  strangers  to  become  acquaint-
ed.72  It has  become  a  social  center  for  teenagers,  however,  and 
has  undoubtedly  helped  them  fmd  each  other.  Even  so,  I  doubt 
whether the pool  has created youthful  friendships on  the  basis of 
neighborhood  except,  perhaps,  among  children  of  elementary 
school  age,  for  older  ones  make  community-wide  contacts  at 
school  and  at  teenage  social  functions.  The  school  playgrounds 
programs  are  restricted  to  neighborhood  children,  but  after-
hours informal use of the playground attracts only those who live 
close  by;  it  is  not  interesting  enough  to  draw  neighborhood 
youngsters  who  live  farther  away.  The  small  shopping  centers, 
whether  planned  or  unplanned,  tend  to  be  on  the  edges  of  two 
neighborhoods,  and  thus  do  not  function  as  neighborhood  cen-
ters,  even  for  the  teenagers  who  gather  there.  The road  system, 
designed in conjunction with the neighborhoods to keep through 
traffic  out of  their  streets,  has  made  them  safer  for  playing chil-
dren, but it has also served to isolate people from other neighbor-
hoods.  The  curvature  of  internal  streets  makes  each  neigh-
borhood a  maze,  and  it is  easy for people  to get lost outside their 
own.  This  has  not  prevented  people  from  making  friends  in 
other  nei~·hborhoods, however,  or  restricted  them  to  socializing 
in  their own.i3 

The socially most significant unit is  the sub-block,  the sector of 
adjacent  houses  facing  each  other  on  the  street,  where  most 
neighbor  visiting and  mutual  help  takes  place.  It  exists  because 
people  need  neighbors,  but can  develop  only  a  limited  number 

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

of social  relationships,  and  because  women  and  children  are  re-
stricted  in  their  mobility. 74  Of  course,  it  is  not a  real  physical 
unit, because  its size and boundaries are unique for each individ-
ual,  being determined  by  his gregariousness.  Sometimes  a  social 
isolate  becomes  the  boundary  between  sub-blocks,  but  sharp 
curves  in  the street  that  site  houses  away  from  each  other create 
the  only  physical  determinant  of  the  sub-block  (and  then  only 
rarely).  When  a  set  of  neighbors  is  very  friendly,  the  sub-block 
may  become  an  in-group  unit  with  which  people  identify,  but 
this  too  is  rare.  More  often,  they  see  other  blocks as  out-groups, 
marked  by  quarreling  or  deviant  behavior,  perhaps  to  assure 
themselves that their own is friendlier than most. 

Neither the sub-block,  the block, nor any other element in the 
site plan is  influential in determining friendships.  Propinquity is 
a  factor  while  people  get  to  know  each  other,  after  which  com-
patibility  becomes  the  major  criterion,  but  the  spaces  between 
houses  and  the  gentle  curvature  of  the  streets  put  enough  dis-
tance  between  people  to allow  them  to  ignore all  but next-door 
neighbors.  Even  the mixture of house  types  on  the street had lit-
tle  social  impact.  Although  class  differences  existed  between  the 
buyers of different  types,  the  variations  in  number of  bedrooms 
encouraged  people  to  make  family-size  rather  than  class  distinc-
tions. 75  Nor did people discriminate in their visiting on  the  basis 
of house  type.  As  a  result,  the gap of $3000 between  the cheapest 
and  most  expensive  house  on  the  block  had  no  impact on social 
life  or on neighbors' attitudes toward each other,  suggesting that 
differently  priced  houses  can  be  put next  to  each  other  without 
negative  results.  How  wide  the  price  gap  can  become  before  it 
has social consequences cannot be answered by my data. In a later 
development,  Bel  Air  (near  Washington),  Levitt  added  a  $25,-
ooo  house  to  the street mix but was  unable  to sell  it until  he lo-
cated  it  in  a  separate  neighborhood.  Presumably,  people  were 
unwilling to buy it amidst houses $5000 to $8ooo cheaper, but no 
reliable  data  are  yet  available  to  determine  how  high  a  price 
difference will discourage mixing of housetypes, and whether it is 
an absolute figure  or a  proportion of house price.  In any case, the 
Levittown  experience  suggests  that  mixing  is  feasible  when  the 
price gap between  the  most expensive and  least  expensive  house 
on the street is 20 per cent. 

Levitt's motive for mixing house types was esthetic;  he wanted 
to  avoid  the criticism  of architectural  monotony aroused  by ear-

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

lier  Levittowns.  The critics  never  noticed  his  innovation,  how· 
ever,  the  Levittown  stereotype having become firmly  established 
by then, and the purchasers also  paid little attention to it.  People 
who  had  moved  from  the  physically  homogeneous  blocks  of 
Levittown,  Pennsylvania,  liked  the  mixture,  but  the  rest  were 
not concerned about architectural sameness.  Actually,  Levitt also 
used  a  highly  variegated  color  scheme  to  increase  diversity,  so 
that  only  every  15oth  house  was  alike;  besides,  purchasers  put 
their  individual  brand  on  the  house  and  yard  soon  after  they 
moved  in.  Their  image  of  other  houses  was  determined  not  by 
their  fa~ades,  but  by  their  occupants,  so  that  (for  neighbors  at 
least)  every  house  quickly  became  unique.  None  of  the  adults 
who  thought  Levittown  dull  ascribed  the  dullness  to  architec-
tural homogeneity. 

More  important  than site  plan and street layout was  the com-
munity's  low  density.  Although  it  was  not  especially  low  as 
suburban areas go--most lots were only 65oo square feet-houses 
10 feet apart gave  people a  sense of privacy.  Even so,  many Levit-
towners  preferred  a  lower  density,  to  put  more  space  between 
them and incompatible neighbors and because lot size is an index 
of status in American society. The low density had some negative 
consequences for  cultural  minorities, separating them  from  com-
patible  neighbors.  For  example,  adolescent  gathering  places  at 
the  shopping  centers  were  beyond  walking  distance,  although 
many teenagers soon coped with it by acquiring bicycles. 

Architects and planners insist that every community must have 
a  single  physical  and  symbolic  center,  but  Levittown,  like  most 
suburban  communities,  lacked  such  a  nucleus.  The main  shop-
ping center was  located  at  the  edge  of the community  to  attract 
outside  purchasers,  but since  it was  still  under construction  dur-
ing the  time of my study,  its impact on people's lives  was  hard to 
define.  It served not only as  a  shopping area but as a  place where 
local  businessmen  (and  mothers)  could  meet  for  lunch and  as  a 
location for occasional community ceremonies. City hall, closer to 
the  geographical  midpoint  of  the  community,  was  its  civic  and 
political  center,  although  the  meetings  of  the  Township  Com· 
mittee  did  not  attract many  residents;  those  meetings for  which 
a  large  turnout could  be  expected were  held  in  a  school  audito-
rium, as  were school  board meetings.  Other centers were the high 
school athletic field, where varsity teams bearing the community's 
name  performed,  and  the  parking  lot  of  the  shopping  center, 

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

where 15,ooo people welcomed  the late President Kennedy when 
he campaigned  in  Levittown. 

It  is  doubtful  whether  Levittown  needed  a  single  nucleus,  or 
whether its existence would have created a  major impact on  peo-
ple's lives.  Few  events  are  of interest  to  a  significant  proportion 
of Levittowners,  so  that  the community is  not likely  to come  to-
gether as a group. In most cities, demand for and use of centers is 
generated by tourists, for  the center is  the area they want to visit. 
In  a  heterogeneous  community,  the  center's  historically  and 
otherwise  sacred  landmarks  may  serve  as  a  cohesive  symbol  for 
those  few  residents  who  need  to  identify  with  the  community; 
more often,  the center is  most  important to local  interest groups 
who want  to  promote a  cohesive  feeling  (civic  pride) among citi-
zens  to  obtain  political  support,  hide community conflict,  or re-
duce the dissension that comes with heterogeneity. Levittown has 
as  much  heterogeneity and conflict  as  any other community,  but 
neither  would  have  been  reduced  by  a  real  or  symbolic  center. 
For  most  Levittowners,  their  own  home  was  the  center  of  the 
community, and  that determined  the  town's  social  structure and 
politics. 

The Social  Environment 

Most  of  the  changes  following  upon  the  move  to  Levittown 
can be traced to the social community, to the impact of people on 
each other. The increased visiting, organizational activity, church 
attendance,  altered  leisure  pursuits;  the  changes  in  health,  mo-
rale,  boredom, and loneliness;  and even some of the new worries 
resulted  neither  from  the  move  to  the  suburb  nor  from  the 
suburbanness of Levittown or its physical  environment, but from 
the  contact  or  lack  of  contact  with  other  people  in  Levittown, 
and  this  in  turn can  be  traced  ultimately to  the population mix. 
The homogeneity of that mix was  the  major source of social  life 
and  the  benefits  to  morale  that  followed;  its  heterogeneity  was 
largely  responsible  for  social  isolation  and  the  resulting  emo-
tional costs. 

A  second  source  of change was  the social  structure.  The need 
for  organizations  to spring into existence  brought about some of 
the  increased organizational participation,  and  the desire of peo-
ple  to  feel  themselves  a  part  of  the  community  (by  which  they 
meant the social structure) encouraged it and religious activity as 
well.  But the social  structure was  also  a  result of the  population 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

mix,  for  it determined  what organizations and  institutions were 
viable,  and  organizational  participation  in  turn  depended  on 
whether members found each  other compatible. The functioning 
of  the  social  structure  was  enhanced  by  two  other  sources:  the 
random  settling  of  purchasers,  that  is,  people's  choosing  their 
houses  without  knowing  who  would  live  next  door;  and  the 
openness of  the  structure itself,  which at  first  admitted  everyone 
who  wanted  to  participate.  When  people  moved  in,  they  were 
atomistic  family  units,  placed  together  arbitrarily,  who  had  to 
trust each other to be friendly  and cooperative  in order to set up 
the  formal  and  informal  groups that would  eliminate  the  initial 
atomization.  This could only be achieved  by an  open,  universal-
istic,  and  achievement-oriented  social  structure,  which  judged 
people  by  what  they  did,  not  what  they  were.  The  random 
settling  hastened  the  development  of  organizations  for  those 
who could not find  compatible  neighbors and was  a  direct  cause 
of  increased  organizational  activity.  For  those  unable  to  join, 
random  settling also  produced  physical  and  social  isolation  by 
scattering people  with  minority tastes,  as  well  as  those  who  had 
come  out  of  cohesive  ethnic  and  working  class  areas  where 
settling  had  been  anything  but  random.  Even  so,  the  openness 
of the social structure probably kept the number of social isolates 
to  a  minimum. 76 

The open social  structure was,  of course, a  direct consequence 
of  newness,  as  was  some  of  the  initial  visiting,  the  unintended 
organizational participation, the reduced boredom and loneliness 
felt  by  Philadelphians, some  of the joint family  activity,  and  the 
change  in spare-time activity.  Newness  alone  was  not enough  to 
explain the increased social  activity,  however,  for  if the strangers 
who came  together had been  more heterogeneous in background 
and characteristics,  the first  meetings could well  have  resulted in 
conflict and a  general retreat into the safety of home and family. 
Because people were sufficiently homogeneous to trust each other, 
they could share the common pains of newness and the needs of a 
new community and act  together in  the ways  that  produced  the 
behavior  changes  here  reported.  Ultimately,  then,  the  p-rimary 
source of change  was  the population mix of Levittown. 

TilE AGENTS  OF IMPACT 

Behavior  changes  must  be  traced  beyond sources,  to agents and 
agencies  that  have  some  influence  over  them,  particularly since 

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

•  285  • 

policies for change can be effective only if they can assign respon-
sibility  to  agents  within  or  without  the  community.  Obviously, 
Levitt was a  major agent of change, for  without him there would 
have  been  no  Levittown,  but  not all  of  the  firm's  decisions  and 
decision-makers  were  important.  For  example,  those  designing 
the  physical  community  were  not,  but  those  creating  the  Levitt 
houses  were  crucial.  Levitt's  mass  production  techniques  made 
it possible to build an entire community, and at a  price that pro-
vided  the opportunity for  home  ownership  to  people who could 
not have  moved  to  the suburbs otherwise.  Of course,  the federal 
government  played  a  role  as  well,  for  without  FHA  insurance, 
Levitt could not have kept either the price or the down  payment 
as  low as  he did.  Mass  production  also  made  it  possible  to  maxi-
mize the space of the house, which in turn enhanced family activ-
ities and individual  privacy (for adults)  and  thus  improved  their 
morale. 

Since the behavior changes brought about by the house and by 
home ownership were largely intended ones,  Levitt did not really 
change  people's  lives.  He  (and  FHA)  enabled  people  to  achieve 
their aspirations for  home ownership,  but he did not bring these 
aspirations  into  being.  The  most  important  agents  of  change, 
therefore,  were  the  aspirations  themselves  and  the  processes  of 
purchaser  recruitment  that  determined  the  population  mix. 
These  processes  cannot  be  ascribed  either  to  Levitt  or  to  any 
other single  agent.  He designed  houses  that served  the  needs  of 
young  families  with  children,  but  he  made  no  effort  to  attract 
young families  and had  in  fact  no policies of purchaser selection 
other than race;  until  the community was  integrated, he  took all 
whites who  wished  to  buy and could pass  the credit check.  This 
was  standard  suburban  builder  practice,  as  was  the  random 
settling pattern.  Both  were,  furthermore,  responses  to  purchaser 
preferences;  houses  were  built  for  young  families  because  they 
have been the mainstay of the suburban housing market for  over 
a decade, and communities were settled randomly because people 
came as  individual family units. If they had come as  a clan or as a 
clique of friends, Levitt would have been glad to sell  them an en-
tire  block or two.  Even  Levitt's decision  to  offer  houses  within  a 
narrow  price  range  was  a  standard  builder  practice,  which  re-
sponded  to  property  value  and  status  concerns  among  the  pur-
chasers. 

Thus,  people's  preferences  as  purchasers  led  to  builder  prac-
tices,  which  in  turn  produced  the  population  mix.  l:!lJ-~m_ately, 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

then,  people  wert:  their  own  agents,  and  the  changes  that  came 
about as  a  result  of the  move were created  by  the  pressures  and 
aspirations which  led them to the suburban builders.  The princi-
pal  pressures  were  the  lack  of  space  and  modernity  of  today's 
middle-income  urban  housing  stock,  the  deterioration  and  con-
gestion of the cities, and the normal and ceaseless processes of in-
vasion and succession  that bring about neighborhood population 
change.  Some  Philadelphians  were  pushed  by  the  expansion  of 
the Negro ghetto, others by the desire to escape from  the parental 
generation;  the  Transients  were  impelled  by  the  needs  of  their 
corporate  employers.  The  principal  aspirations  were  for  a  de-
tached  house,  home  ownership.  and  "outdoor"  living.  These as-
pirations and the conditions that made it possible to realize them 
are  the  final  source-and-agent  of  Levittown's  impact,  and  they 
can  be  traced  back to more fundamental  sources  and agents  out-
side  the  community,  in  the  national  culture  and  economy. 

Many explanations have been offered for  the intense desire for 
home  ownership  and  the  single-family,  low-density  house.  Some 
have  pointed  to  post-World War II government  policies making 
it cheaper to own than to rent. These policies encouraged people 
to buy houses and discouraged apartment living, but they did not 
create  the  desire.  Others  have  argued  that  it  results  from  mass 
media depictions of  an  idealized suburbia.  Admittedly, much of 
the  popular fiction,  in  print and on television,  takes  place  in lo-
cales  which  cross  the  nineteenth  century  small  town  with  the 
modern suburb, but they do not therefore inspire their audiences 
to  move  to  the  suburbs.  For  one  thing,  research  shows  that  the 
media are not very  effective in changing important values.  More 
important,  a  historical  analysis  of  the  media  would  show  that 
they  follow  taste  more  often  than  they  lead  it.  Women  were 
smoking  in  America  before  heroines  of mass  media  fiction  were 
allowed  to do  so,  and  the dominant  media audience  had  moved 
to the suburbs before the popular dramas and situation comedies 
followed  them.  Stories about upper class  suburbanites have  been 
a staple of American popular culture for  several generations now, 
but media  portrayal  of  lower  middle  class  life  has  been  located 
in  the suburbs for only a  few  years. 

Another explanation  proceeds  from  status:  the  popular desire 
for suburban  home ownership  imitates  the  fashion-setting  upper 
and  upper  middle  classes.  This  argument  is  historically  more 
viable than  that of mass media imitation, because higher-income 

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

groups have lived in the suburbs since before the turn of the cen-
tury.  The  dream  home  of  most  Levittowners  is  not  the  Main 
Line or Westchester County suburban mansion,  however,  but "a 
bigger  house  with  some  acreage  around  it,"  a  tiny  farm  (not  to 
be farmed)  with all  the conveniences of urban and suburban liv-
ing,  including easy  access  to  social  life.  This  dream  residence  is 
not of recent origin, but is  rooted in the cultures of most Ameri-
cans,  Protestant  and  Catholic,  middle  class  and  working  class 
alike.  Among  middle  class  Protestants,  the  home-ownership  as-
piration can  be traced  back  to the rural and small-town  heritage 
of  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  century  America  and  England; 
among working class Catholics,  to  the peasant settlements of con-
tinental  Europe.  Only the Jews did not share this rural  heritage, 
and although acculturation has persuaded many to accept it, Jews 
are  still  more  favorably  inclined  to  city  living  than  any  other 
group. 77  The  mass  media  have  promulgated  the  Protestant  and 
Catholic  ideal,  and  in  their  own  way,  so  have  the  upper classes 
-but they have not generated it, for it preceded them both. Even 
if the American  upper classes  had opted for  an  urbane existence 
in  inner<ity  luxury  apartment  buildings,  I  doubt  whether  the 
desire for suburbia among the rest of the population would have 
been  significantly reduced.  Actually,  even  the ideal  of the celeb-
rities  and  performers  who  monopolize  what  little  upper  class 
fashion-setting  exists  is  not  apartment  living,  but a  Manhattan 
townhouse and a  weekend country mansion-also a single-family 
house aspiration. 

The American economy of the nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries  made  the  traditional  popular  housing  ideal  unachiev-
able,  industrialization  and  urbanization  forcing.  many  rural 
Americans,  like  the  European  immigrants,  into city  tenements. 
They  lived  there  out  of  necessity,  and  made  the  best  of  it,  al-
though  some  became  confirmed  urbanites  and  tenants.  But  the 
majority  moved  out  at  the  earliest  opportunity,  first  to  row 
houses,  then  to  single-family  houses  still  within  the city  but far-
ther removed from  its center with every generation. After World 
\Var II,  however,  prosperity and government housing policy  put 
suburbia  within  reach  of  the  urban  lower  middle  and  working 
classes.  Of course.  if the government had decided to subsidize ur-
ban  apartments  instead,  many  would  have  moved  into  them. 
This would  not  have  abrogated  their aspirations,  but only  frus-
'trated  and  postponed  them.  Government  policy  is  not  made  in 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

vacuo,  however,  and  the  elected  officials  who  decided  to  sub-
sidize suburbia were aware of their constituents' aspirations.  Per-
haps  they could have  ignored  them,  especially during the drastic 
housing shortage of the postwar era,  but politicians are not given 
to crossing the voters unnecessarily, and there was no good reason 
for.them  to do so at the time. 

The move  to  the  suburbs was  encouraged  further  by rapid so-
cial  change, which created large differences between generations, 
eroded  the  ties  that held ethnic groups together,  and encouraged 
young families  to  leave  the parental environment. Young  people 
have always been most mobile, but today they marry increasingly 
outside  their own neighborhood and  this  too reduces loyalties  to 
older areas.  In addition, many want to give their children a  "bet-
ter start," so  that they are almost inevitably led to a  new environ-
ment in the suburbs . 

. THEORETICAL AND  POLICY IMPLICATIONS 

The  findings  on  changes  and  their  sources  suggest  that  the  dis-
tinction  between  urban  and  suburban  ways  of  living  postulated 
by  the  critics  (and  by  some  sociologists  as  well)  is  more  imagi-
nary than real.  Few changes can  be  traced  to  the  suburban qual-
ities of Levittown, and the sources that did cause change, like  the 
house,  the  population  mix,  and  newness,  are  not  distinctively 
suburban.  Moreover,  when  one  looks  at  similar  populations  in 
city and  suburb,  their ways  of life  are  remarkably alike.  For  ex-
ample, when suburbs are compared to the large urban residential 
areas  beyond  the  downtown  and  inner  districts,  culture  and  so-
cial  structure are virtually the same among people of similar age 
and  class.  Young  lower  middle  class  families  in  these  areas  live 
much  like  their  peers  in  the  suburbs,  but  quite  unlike  older, 
upper middle  class  ones,  in  either  urban  or suburban  neighbor-
hoods. 

The crucial difference between cities and suburbs, then, is  that 
they are often home for different kinds of people. If one is  to un-
derstand  tDeir  behavior,  these differences  are  much  more  impor-
tant  than  whether  they  reside  inside  or  outside  the  city  limits. 
Inner-city  residential  areas  are  home  to  the  rich,  the  poor,  and 
the  nonwhite,  as  well  as  the unmarried and  the  childless  middle 
class.  Their  ways  of  life  differ· from  those  of  suburbanites  and 
people in the outer city, but because they are not young working

or lower or upper  middle class  families.  If populations and  resi-
dential  areas  were  described  by age  and class  characteristics,  and 
by racial, ethnic, and religious ones, our understanding of human 
settlements  would  be  much  improved.  Using  such  concepts  as 
"urban"  and  "suburban"  as  causal  variables  adds  little,  on  the 
other  hand,  except  for  ecological  and  demographic  analyses  of 
communities  as  a  whole  and  for  studies  of  political  behavior. 78 
The  findings  also  question  a  related  theory,  espoused  by  city 
planners,  that the community, especially  its  physical  component, 
is  a  significant determinant  of  behavior.  The  social  community 
is  important, of course,  particularly  in  a  politically autonomous 
settlement  which  can  determine  its  own  fate.  Nevertheless  the 
intended changes made by the members of that community came 
from  their aspirations,  which  originated outside  the  community 
in national cultural patterns;  even  the unintended ones  reflected 
social  and  organizational  practices  prevalent  in national  middle 
and  working class  cultures.  For example,  when  low-status  Levit-
towners  became  social  isolates,  they  suffered  from  nationally de-
termined status distinctions, and when Jews  increased  their syna-
gogue  attendance,  they  acted  like  all  Jews  who  settle  randomly 
amid a predominantly non-Jewish population. 

Likewise,  city  planners  overes~imate the  role  of  builders  and 
designers as  agents  of change.  Not only are builder policies  are-
sponse  to  the demands of expected purchasers,  but they are  usu-
ally  national  practices,  which  in  turn  follow  from  national  cul-
tural  patterns.  Levitt's  recruitment  policies  reflected  national 
preferences  for  age  and  class  homogeneity,  and  the  breakup  of 
extended families  and ethnic enclaves.  He could have developed 
an  individual recruitment pattern, for  example,  to create a  dem-
ographically  "balanced"  community,  but  only  by  luring  pres-
ently  recalcitrant  urbanites  out  of  the  city  and  rejecting  many 
willing  young  families.  Even  the  subsidies  and  restraints  with 
which  he  worked  originated  from  federal  and  state  more  than 
local  government.  Moreover,  the  population  mix  he  did  recruit 
was  only  partially  pulled  by  the  house  and  community  he 
offered,  and  often  pushed  by  demographic  changes  in  Phila-
delphia  (again  reflections  of national  trends),  by  the  makeup  of 
the regional  housing market  and  its  offerings,  and  by  a  regional 
and national economy that was shifting offices and factories  to the 
suburbs generally and to South Jersey in particular. 

Plans  and  policies  aimed  at  changing  people's  behavior  can 

•  290  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNEBS 

therefore not be implemented through prescribing alterations in 
the physical  community or by directives aimed at  builders;  they 
must be directed at  the national sources and agents which bring 
about  the  present  behavior.  The fact  that  policies  for  changing 
behavior  must  be  based  on  other  foundations  does  not  mean, 
however,  that policies with different aims, e.g.  to minimize traffic 
congestion, and  to regulate builder practices for  other goals,  e.g. 
to outlaw shoddy construction, should be abandoned. 

Planning for Behavior Change 

These conclusions may be  truisms,  but they have  implications 
for  the policy-maker who  is  seeking change  in  people's behavior 
or  in  the  community.  If he wants  to change  a  social  or  physical 
component of the community, he must first determine whether it 
affects  residents'  crucial  aspirations  or values.  If it does,  he  has 
three alternatives:  to make no change, to alter the component so 
that  it  will  achieve  the  aspirations  in  another  way,  or  to  alter 
aspirations so  that people will  accept  the changed component he 
has in mind. If the component is not a source of valued behavior, 
the policy-maker has more freedom,  for if his plan has no impact 
on  people's  lives,  they will  not  car~ one way  or  the other.  The 
city planner has often been able to make innovations in site plans 
and in the physical community for  this reason. 

If the policy-maker seeks to change a component of behavior, he 
must find  out if it is valued or situational, i.e., a  tolerated or un-
wanted adaptation to necessity. If the behavior is valued, he must 
either satisfy or change  the values;  if it is  situational, he is  freer 
to  plan.  In either case  he must,  of course,  orient his  plan  to  the 
proper sources  and  agents  of  behavior.  For  example,  a  planner 
aiming for more community participation can try to change aspi-
rations, which  would be quite difficult,  requiring a wholesale so-
cial  reorganization  to  transfer  the  emotional  rewards  of  family 
and  informal  group life  to  the community.  Or he can affect  the 
sources of participation, by depriving a  new community of insti-
tutions so  that people have  to create them and by inducing com-
munity crises, for these always stimulate participation. 

The city  planner has  traditionally chosen  the most difficult of 
his options:  to change people's aspirations so  that they will accept 
a  community  component  he  considers  desirable.  And  he  has 
chosen  the  most  spurious  of  all  solutions:  to  induce  behavior 
change through a physical component. "Educating" people to ac-

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

•  291  • 

cept  the  cultural,  moral,  or  economic  superiority  of  his  ideal 
community has not been very effective, however,  for  preaching is 
rarely  attended  and  few  people  are  persuaded  by  an  argument 
which  attacks  their  behavior as  inferior  and  their  aspirations as 
unworthy.  When  the  physical  component  and  the  behavioral-
change goal  turn  out  to  be  values  of  upper  middle  class  profes-
sionals as  well,  other classes  may reject  the  planner as  well  as  his 
plan. 

Aspirations  are  difficult  to  change  deliberately;  even  adver-
tisers have not yet come up with an effective method. This is  just 
as well,  for such power is awesome and likely to be misused more 
often  than  not.  Most  often, aspirations change as  a  result of nec-
essary  behavior  change:  if  a  transformation  in  the  economy  or 
the  social  structure requires  people  to act differently,  their aspi-
rations  will  eventually  change  accordingly.  Necessity  cannot 
often  be  manipulated  by  the  policy-maker,  however.  Probably 
the  best deliberate  method of changing aspirations  is  to  provide 
people  with  alternative  opportunities  that  are  by  their  lights 
clearly  superior;  this  policy  will  result  in  behavior change  and, 
eventually,  in value change  as  well.  New  aspirations are formed 
OQt  of new opportunities, provided these  opportunities appeal to 
some  present aspiration,  for  otherwise they  will  not be accepted. 
City  planners  are  geared  to  providing  new  opportunities,  but 
usually those they find desirable, and without concern about how 
other  people feel.  Often,  they deny  that people have aspirations, 
arguing that  they  do  not  know  what  they  want,  and will  there-
fore  be receptive  to whatever the planner considers superior. Al· 
though  people  may  not  know  what  they  want,  they  know  what 
they do not want;  more important,  they are able to choose when 
choices  are  offered  them.  It is  up  to  the  planner  to  offer  such 
choices,  and  if  he  proposes  choices  that  reflect  people's  aspi-
rations,  they  will  be accepted;  if not,  they  will  be  ignored. 

Needless  to  say,  the  policy-maker  must  sometimes  advocate 
policies that do not coincide with people's aspirations, but are re-
quired  by  the  public  interest,  for  example,  transportation  facil-
ities  to  prevent  the  future  traffic  congestion  his  studies  predict. 
Preventive planning demands present sacrifices for future gain, a 
behavior  change  most  people  are  unwilling  to  make,  unless  in-
centives,  such  as  tax  benefits  for  long-range  planning,  are  pro-
vided.  In  appealing  to  the  public  interest,  the  planner must  be 
careful, however, that he is not just imposing his own aspirations. 
If he  considers  traffic  congestion  or  a  long commuting trip  un-

•  292  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

desirable,  but  the  commuters do  not,  he  must  provide  evidence 
for  his proposals.  If he can prove that failure  to plan will  lead to 
consequences  which  people  consider  harmful  (for  example,  if a 
long journey to work would eventually lead to chronic weariness 
and  family  conflict),  he is  justified  in trying to impose  his  plans, 
although wise  strategy would dictate combining them with other 
plans that offer incentives. He can also insist on his ideas if he can 
demonstrate that people will be pleased once they have made the 
change.  In both instances,  however,  he  must be able  to prove  to 
his clients that the outcome of his planning will accord with their 
aspirations,  not  just  his.  But  if  there  are  no  serious  negative 
consequences  to  a  long  journey  to  work,  the  -planner  cannot 
expect people  to make sacrifices  just because  he  thinks a  shorter 
journey would be good for  them. 

The attempt to induce behavior change through physical com-
ponents  is  of  course  likely  to  fail,  because  it deals  with spurious 
sources and agents.  Indeed, the Levittown data make it clear that 
the  only  physical  planning  which  induces  behavior  change  is 
house-related.  The  policy-maker  can  increase  contentment  by 
providing  sufficient  internal  and  yard  space  to  afford  family 
members  greater  privacy  and  opportunities  for  more  activity. 
And if  his  house  planning is  superior,  people may  be willing to 
accept  innovations  in  the physical  community, but if he suggests 
innovations at the price of an inferior house." he is  sure to  fail.  If 
the  policy-maker wants  to increase  neighborhood cohesion,  how-
ever,  physical solutions such as neighborhood schemes or the pro-
vision  of  plazas  where  neighbors  can  meet  are  irrelevant,  for  so 
long as  neighbors  have  no  reason  to  meet,  they  will  not  do  so. 
Cohesion  can  only  be  increased  by  making  the  neighborhood  a 
political unit, or by so altering the family that people will derive 
more  satisfaction  from  being  with  neighbors  than  with  spouse 
and children.  Such  policies  are  not  likely  to  be  popular or  fea-
sible.  If the  policy-maker  wanted  to  increase  family  cohesion  or 
contentment,  however,  his  plans  would  probably  be  accepted. 
But these would  have  to  improve  the  house  or deal  with  the  so-
cial sources  of family  discontent described  in  the  previous  chap-
ter:  by  finding  ways  of  reducing  physical  and  social  isolation 
among  unhappy  suburban  housewives,  eliminating  husbands' 
traveling on the  job, and removing financial  worries. 

A  good  illustration  of  the  various  drawbacks  in  the  city 
planner's approach is  his current advocacy of higher-density sub-

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

urban  development.  He  and  his  colleagues  argue  for  suburban 
row  house and apartment construction  because  they  believe  that 
the  single-family  house  wastes  land,  encourages  urban  sprawl, 
increases  commuting,  makes  for  a  physically  monotonous  com· 
munity,  and discourages  an  urbane way of living.  Few  actual  or 
potential  suburbanites share  these attitudes,  because  they do not 
accept the business efficiency concept and the upper middle class, 
antisuburban  esthetic  built  into  them.  In  this  instance,  the 
planner  is  asking  people  to  change  their  aspirations  to  accept  a 
physical.community he considers desirable,  demanding behavior 
change  through a  new physical  form,  and  ignoring their own as· 
pirations.  Typically,  he  claims  that  if  people  woJ.Ild  only  try  a 
modern row  house,  they would accept  it, but he  has  not yet con-
vinced  them that it provides the privacy and status of the single-
family house, and they are loath to give up private yards for more 
public open  space,  which would require  them  to sacrifice  family 
privacy for involuntary interaction with neighbors. 

Land shortages  may well  require  the  next generation  of home 
buyers  to  live  in row  house suburbs,  but if  planning were  sensi-
tive  to  their  aspirations,  consumer  research  and  design  experi-
mentation  to develop  plans that wi~l please  them would  now be 
under  way.  If city  planners  were  rational,  they  would  also  stop 
trying  to  impose  their  desire  for  urbanity,  particularly  through 
physical  solutions.  They could  either  retire  this  goal  and design 
for  improved "suburbanity," or they  could  begin  to  plan  on  the 
basis of the real sources of urbanity.  Since  it is  to  be found  prin-
cipally among  upper  middle  class  cosmopolitans,  the  solution  is 
to develop ways  of giving people upper middle class  incomes and 
job opportunities and cosmopolitan schooling for  their children. 
So  fat;- I  have asked  whether  the  planner can  change  behavior 
and aspirations,  but have  begged  the question of whether or not 
he should.  If Levittown were as  harmful  as  the critics claim and 
as  undesirable as  the city  planners believe,  the answer  would  be 
obvious. Since this is  not the case,  however, the planner's decision 
about  change  should  be  governed  by  two  assumptions:  (1)  in  a 
pluralistic  society,  alternative  ways  of  living-and  community 
arrangements-are  justified,  provided  they  are  not  clearly  anti-
social  or individually destructive;  (2)  the  people for whom he  is 
planning are  on  the  whole  the  best judges  of how  they  want  to 
live.  The  planner may  prefer urbanity,  but unless  he can  prove 
other alternatives  to  be  harmful,  this  preference  only gives  him 

•  294  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

the  right  to  practice  it  himself.  The  key  word  is  prove,  for  if 
people's wishes have harmful consequences,  he  ought  to propose 
change and  use all  possible means  to  implement  it.  Even  so,  the 
consequences  must  be  harmful  for  them  and  their  aspirations 
and  not  just for  his;  or they must be demonstrably antisocial  or 
self-destructive.  Obviously,  people's wishes  to destroy  themselves 
and  harm  their  neighbors  through  drug  addiction  cannot  be 
accepted,  but  their  willingness  to  accept  long  work  trips  in ex· 
change  for  lower  residential  density  should  be  honored,  unless 
superior ways of achieving the family goals  that  underlie the de-
sire  for  low  density  can  be  found.  Likewise,  if  the  planner can 
prove  that  changes  people  consider  undesirable  may  actually 
benefit  them  and  the  goals  they  value most,  he ought  to defend 
such  changes.  For example,  if  the  planner can  demonstrate  that 
the  introduction  of apartments  into  a  single-family  house  com-
munity-a change  most  suburbanites oppose-will  reduce  their 
taxes  or permit improvements in municipal  services  of  the  kind 
they  want,  he  is  justified in  proposing change.  If people  prefer, 
however,  to  pay  higher  taxes  to  maintain  the  status  and  other 
values  they derive  from  limiting the community to single-family 
housing,  they  have  the  right  to  do  so. 

One problem remains:  when people in a community do not all 
have the same aspirations and when the choice is not between the 
community and  the  planner,  but between  the community and a 
larger area.  For example, some suburban residents may favor  the 
introduction  of  high-rise  housing,  but when  opinions  vary,  ma-
jority rule should prevail.  A community may be united in its op-
position to high-rise housing, but the region may need it and the 
best location for it may be in that community. There is no simple 
answer  to  this  dilemma.  The needs of the region  ought  to  have 
priority  over the  community's,  if  only because  of  majority  rule, 
but  some  minority  rights  must  remain  absolute.  The  desire  to 
keep out apartments does not fall  into this category,_but the right 
of Negroes to enter a community when the majority of white res-
idents  opposes  them  is  constitutionally  inalienable.  If behavior 
change must be imposed, however, it ought to include incentives. 
For example, when opposition to integration stems from fears  of 
status deprivation the change ought to be planned so as  to mini-
mize  it,  by  making sure  the  first  Negroes  are  of  high  status,  by 
helping newcomers with financial  aid so  that visible signs of low 

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

•  295  • 

status can be removed, and by scheduling integration so that peo-
ple of different status are not  thrown  together arbitrarily. 

Planning values  like neighborhood cohesion  and  urbanity are 
not absolute values, however, and cannot be used to justify rejec-
tion of people's aspirations. The city planner's professional status 
entitles him to apply his professional expertise and to propose his 
own  values,  but  not  to  insist  on  them.  These  are  rarely  profes-
sional  ones anyway,  but  those  of  the  upper  middle class  culture 
from  which  he  comes.  More  important,  his  approach  often  de-
mands  allegiance  to  such  values  from  people  who  lack  the  eco-
nomic and other opportunities that create  them, so  that he is  de-
manding upper middle class  standards--and  ~sing public  power 
to  back  up  his  demands--without  providing  for  upper  middle 
class  incomes.  This  is  like  insisting  that  poor  people  buy  Cad-
illacs  simply  because  they  are  demonstrably  superior  to  Chev-
rolets.  If the quality of life  is  to  be altered,  economic and  other 
incentives ought to be made available. Voluntary and wanted be-
havior changes can be encouraged in other ways,.  but involuntary 
ones are  difficult  to  implement,  and  their  imposition  should  be 
limited  to  goals  that  reflect  the  public  interest  and  minority 
rights.

2.  In this analysis "commJ..Inity"  is defined in the  traditional sense  to 
include  all  of  the  physical  and  social  components  of  human  set-
tlements. 

3·  People were asked,  "How has  your  life changed since you  moved 

to Levittown?" 

4·  The major unintended changes at this  point were  increased joint 

family  activity,  organizational  participation,  and visiting. 

5·  Slum  dwellers  who moved  to  a  new  public housing  project-but 
into apartments--showed  an  increase  in  a  variety  of measures  of 
morale, but not much more than a control group moving into old 
private housing. See  Wilner et al.,  Chap.  15. 

6.  Seventy-two per cent ascribed  the  increase  in joint family  activity 

to the house  and yard. 

7·  Slum dwellers moving into new public housing apartments lacked 

•  296  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

the  stimulus  of  the  house,  for  they  reported  almost  no  change 
in joint family  activity  and marital relations after the move.  Wil-
ner et al.,  Chap.  1 1. 

8.  In  the  first  interview,  75  per cent of  the  random  sample  credited 
the  house  and  12  per  cent  the  community;  by  the  second  inter-
view,  the percentages were  37  and 37· Among the Philadelphians, 
54  per  cent  credited  the  house,  23  per  cent  credited  the  com-
munity.

10.  Since  husbands  never  missed  relatives,  this  analysis  was  limited 
to  women.  Fifty-five  per  cent  of  those  not  missing  relatives  got 
along  better  with  their  husbands,  as  compared  to  none  of  those 
who  did  miss  them. 

11.  Kiser's  careful  study  of  the  number  of  third  children  born  to  a 
national  sample  discovered  little  difference  in  births  between  ur· 
ban and suburban  parents of the  same  religion, or between those 
moving within  the city and from  city  to suburb. 

12.  Fifty·seven  per  cent  of  the  Philadelphians  with  unplanned  chil-
dren were  Catholics;  28  per cent were  poorly educated non-Cath-
olics.  Even  if one  assumed  that  neither  practiced  birth  control, 
this still leaves  15  per cent "accidents." 

13.  Seventy-three  per  cent  of  those  wanting  more  neighboring  re-
ported an increase,  and  75  per cent of  those  wanting less  also got 
their  wish.  Altogether,  62  per  cent  of  the  respondents  did  the 
amount  of  neighboring  they  wanted.  For couple  visiting,  the  fig-
ures were slightly lower:  only 53  per cent wanting more were able 
to  achieve it; altogether, only 44  per cent got what they wanted. 
14.  Fifty-six  per cent  of changes  in  couple  visiting  were  unintended. 
Thirty-one per cent of those who had wanted no change did more, 
and  10  per cent  of those  wanting more  did  less.  Thirty-eight  per 
cent of changes in neighboring were  unintended,  and 42  per cent 
of  those  wanting  no  change  actually  found  themselves  doing 
more. 

15.  In Levittown, Pennsylvania, 65 per cent of the women interviewed 
had  wanted more  evening visitors  at  home,  but only  20  per cent 
reported more  "than  they  were  used  to."  Even  so,  So  per centre-
ported having visitors  and going  to visit  at least  once  a  week.  Ja-
hoda  et  al.,  pp.  112-113. 

. 

16.  In the random sample, 75  per cent of former city residents and 38 
per cent of former  suburbanites reported more  neighboring,  and 
24  per cent of the  latter,  less,  but two  thirds of  former  suburban 
apartment dwellers and 84  per cent of urban ones did more neigh-
boring in Levittown. 

17.  All  in all,  41  per cent of the  Philadelphians preferred old  friends 
to Levittowners;  27  per cent preferred the opposite. (The rest were 
undecided or said  both.)  Among mixed-marriage  partners,  67  per 
cent chose old friends  and the rest could not decide.  On the other 

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

•  297  • 

hand,  among  former  Philadelphians  who  had  become  organiza-
tion  members,  31  per cent  chose  Levittowners,  as  compared  to  g 
per cent of nonmembers. 

18.  Similar  friendliness  is  reported  in  a  new  high-rise  apartment  de-
velopment in  downtown Detroit by  Wolf and  Ravitz.  Increase in 
visiting  was  also  found  among  people  moving  into a  new  urban 
public housing  project.  Wilner et al.,  Chap.  12. 

19.  For an  earlier finding  on the role  of predispositions in  suburban 

sociability, see  Fava. 

20.  A  study of Dagenham,  an  English  new  town  now  forty  years  old, 
found  that  the  longest  residents  reported  their streets  the  friend-
liest.  Willmott  (1963),  p.  Gg.  In  an  American  homogeneous  com· 
munity,  long  residence  expanded  the  circle  of  acquaintances, 
rather than increasing the intensity of association. See Caplow and 
Foreman. Pierson's data  from  Levittown,  Pennsylvania,  indicated 
a  decrease  in  neighboring over  time,  however,  for  67  per cent  of 
people living  there  two  to  three  years  were  doing more  neighbor-
ing than in the former residence,  but only  15  per cent with six  to 
seven  years  in  Levittown  were  doing  more;  62  per  cent  of  the 
latter  reported  less  neighboring  than  when  they  first  moved  in. 
The data cannot tell, however, whether the decrease resulted from 
the  aging of  the  community or increasing  incompatibility due  to 
turnover of residents. 

u.  In the random sample,  78 per cent of the previously active and 77 
per cent of  the  inactive were more involved  in Levittown;  in  the 
city  sample,  the  percentages  were  41  per  cent  and  50  per  cent, 
respectively. 

22.  People  were  asked  whether  they  had  "intended  to  join  that  or-
ganization or one like it  before you  moved out to Levittown." 
23.  Another  14  per cent  were  women  who  joined  because  their  hus-
bands were  already  active;  a  similar number joined  because  they 
were asked by  the children. 

24.  In a working class suburb in California,  17  per cent reported join-
ing more organizations  than  where  they  lived  before,  20  per cent 
fewer.  Seventy  per cent belonged  to  none  at all,  however.  Berger 
(1g6o),  p. 59· Slum dwellers moving  to a  new  public housing pro-
ject  reported  a  slight  increase  in  organizational  attendance,  but 
hardly more  than  the  control group moving  to  old housing.  Wil-
ner et al.,  p.  191. 

25.  Only  31  per  cent  were  members  at  the  first  interview,  but  two 
thirds of the rest said  they planned to join an organization in  the 
future, and most later did so.  In Levittown,  Pennsylvania, Pierson 
found that membership increased with length of residence;  46  per 
cent of  those  living  there  three  years  or  less  were  members,  but 
76  per cent of  those living there six  or seven  years. 

26.  In a  new working class  suburb,  27  per cent reported more church 

attendance,  24  per cent less.  Berger (1g6o),  p.  45· 

27.  Thirty-three per cent of them now went  to church less  often,  and 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

only 7 per cent more often.  Among  former  tenants,  on  the other 
hand,  41  per  cent  attended  more,  and only  4  per  cent  less.  One 
reason  for  reduced  attendance  is  the  loss  of parental  baby-sitters. 
The other group which  reduced  its attendance  most  were  profes-
sionals,  29  per  cent  reporting  a  decrease  as  compared  to  9  per 
cent  of  white  collar workers  and  14  per cent  of blue collar ones. 
28.  Among Catholics in the Philadelphia sample,  14  per cent attended 
more  often,  10  per cent  less.  Among  the  Protestants,  42  per cent 
attended more,  8  per cent  less.  Among  the Jews,  67  per  cent  at-
tended  more,  17  per cent  less.  In  the  suburb  studied  by  Berger, 
fundamentalist  Baptists were  the  only group  to go  to  church  sig-
nificantly  more  often  after  the  move.  Berger  (1960),  p.  48. 
29.  Even  so,  only  8  per  cent  of  the  Jewish  synagogue  members  at-

tended regularly. 

30.  The  random  sample  intermarried group  reported  a  13  per  cent 
increase;  the  Philadelphia  sample,  no  increase  but  a  30  per cent 
decrease. 

31.  In the Philadelphia sample, two thirds of former apartment-dwell-
ing  Protestants  went  to  church  more,  as  compared  to  a  third  of 
those  coming from  row  houses  or detached ones.  For the  random 
sample,  the percentages were 54  and  14. 

32.  Forty  per  cent  of  those  increasing  their  church  attendance  also 
reported more couple visiting,  but none of those who decreased it 
or  did  not  change  it  altered  their  visiting.  For  neighboring,  the 
percentages were 6o  and 26  per cent respectively.  Among random 
sample Protestants, differences were negligible. Unfortunately, the 
data  cannot identify the causally  prior factor. 
33·  Catholics did  not make  a  single  friend  at church. 
34·  The random sample was asked about shifts in party allegiance be-
tween  the  first  and  second  Levittown  elections,  when  a  likeable 
Republican  amateur  defeated  a  veteran  Democratic  professional 
politician. Sixteen per cent had shifted parties,  10  per cent of pre-
vious  Republicans  but  fully  44  per  cent  of  previous  Democrats. 
There  were  no  background  differences  between  changers  and 
stable voters,  and many of the shifts were probably temporary,  for 
the Republican lost decisively in  the following  election. 

35·  Similar party stability has been reported for Levittown, New York, 
by  Wattel,  p.  299;  in  other American  suburbs,  by  Berger  (196o), 
p. 3;  Lazerwitz; Wallace; and in an English new town,  by Willmott 
(1963),  p.  105.  See  also  Banfield  and Wilson,  pp.  16-17. 

36.  In  a  newly  suburban  working  class  population,  29  per cent  said 
their interest in politics increased after they became home owners. 
Berger (196o),  p.  36. 

37·  Fifty-nine  per cent  of  the  women  and 50  per cent of  the  men  re-
ported  less  spare  time;  4  per  cent  and  17  per  cent  reported  no 
change.  Respondents were  also  asked  to  answer  the  question  for 
their  spouses.  Whereas  the  women  judged  changes  in  their  hus-
bands'  spare  time  correctly,  the  men  overestimated  the  decrease 

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

•  299  • 

and underestimated the increase in spare time reported by women. 
Evidently they thought Levittown had been harder on the women 
than  was  actually  the  case. 

118.  Of  those  reporting  activity  changes,  41  per  cent  also  have  more 
spare time, and 511  per cent less;  among those reporting no activity 
change,  only  23 ·per cent  now  have  more  time  and  62  per  cent 
have less. 

39·  For the  random sample as  a  whole,  Levittown's  impact on spare-
time  change is  less,  64  per cent of  the  reasons  given  being unre-
lated,  20 per cent related to the  house,  and  16  per cent related  to 
the community. For activity change, only 7 per cent are unrelated, 
however;  50  per cent are  house-related  and  411  per cent  are  com-
munity-related. 

40.  As regards  time change,  the impact of moving to  the suburbs and 
to  a  house  is  about  the  same  for  former  urbanites,  although  for-
mer suburban single-family  home  occupants naturally  report  less 
time change than anyone else. 

41.  Among  these  with  more  spare  time,  37  per  cent  are  less  bored 
now  than  they  were  in  the  former  residence.  Among  those  with 
fewer spare hours, 12  per cent are more bored, 56 per cent less. 
42.  In the California working class suburb, 29 per cent reported drink-
ing less, and 4 per cent more, but otherwise there was little change 
in leisure styles.  Berger  (196o),  p.  79· 

43·  Percentages are from both samples combined to obtain a  sufficient 
number of  respondents.  The  styles  were  named  by  the  respond-
ents,  and  "modern"  refers  to  what  professional  designers  call 
"Moderne"  or "Hollywood  Modern."  The  designers'  conception 
of mode·rn was described as  "Danish Modern" by one  respondent. 
44·  Some people derived  their inspiration from  Levitt's model houses, 
but since these were furnished in a wide array of styles,  the builder 
gave  them no single clue for  furnishing his houses. 

45·  A  study  of Levittown,  New  York,  suggests  individual  taste  as  the 

prime determinant. Wattel, p.  297. 

46.  The first  time, 72  per cent liked it "very much,"  23  per cent "quite 
a  bit,"  and  5  per cent "don't care  one way  or the  other."  By  the 
second interview,  the  percentages were  61,  32,  and  7 respectively. 
The Philadelphians  were  less  satisfied,  36  per cent  liking  it  very 
much, 42  per cent quite a bit, and 22  per cent ambivalent. In both 
samples,  low-status  people  tended  to  be  most  dissatisfied.  The 
question  was  very  general,  came  early  in  the  interview,  and  re-
quired respondents  to choose  between  fixed  categories,  so  the  fig-
ures  themselves  probably  mean  little.  Despite  the  unwillingness 
to  dislike  Levittown,  people  did  not  hesitate  to  answer  the  next 
question:  "Is  there  anything  you  don't  like  so  well  about  Levit-
town?" 

47·  In the random sample, complaints about lot size came from former 

suburbanites,  but the Philadelphians mentioned  them  too. 

48.  In the first  interview,  73  per cent expected  to stay,  19  per cent to 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

move,  and  8  per  cent  were  undecided.  In  the  second,  everyone 
had  made  up  his  mind,  74  per  cent  to  stay  and  26  per  cent  to 
leave. The initially uncertain were too few  to be analyzed. Propor-
tionately,  more  of  the  initially  decided  changed  their  mind  in 
favor  of  staying,  for  of  intended  Settlers,  only  13  per  cent  now 
want  to  move,  and of Mobiles,  half now  expect  to  stay. 

49·  Since  the  Philadelphians  were  interviewed  only  once,  these  data 
come from respondents who had filled  out mail questionnaires be-
fore  arrival,  and may  be an unrepresentative fraction  of the total 
sample. 

50.  Seventy-three  per  cent of  the  California  working  class  suburban-
ites  planned  to settle,  21  per cent  to  move.  Berger  (1g6o),  p.  109. 
51.  Altogether, young women,  the college-educated,  high school drop-
outs,  blue  collar workers,  Italian  and  Jewish  women,  Irish  men, 
first and second generation Americans, and partners in mixed mar· 
riages  miss  the  city  most  often.  Education  was  the  determining 
factor;  except among  Italians and other Southern  Europeans,  the 
better  educated  missed  the  city  more  than  the  poorly  educated; 
even  among  the  Jews,  who  missed  it  more  than  other  ethnic 
groups,  the  better-educated  outnumbered  the  others.  The longer 
people  have  lived  in  the  city,  the  more  they  are  likely  to  miss  it, 
except again for  the Italians. The latter also miss the city only for 
people  they  know  there;  all  other groups did so  even if they  were 
not lonely for  relatives  and  old  friends. 

52.  Fifty-six  per  cent  of  all  women  mentioned  missing  downtown 
shopping, some adding  cultural facilities  as  well.  Sixteen per cent 
missed  the  old  neighborhood  or  corner  stores;  another  16  per 
cent, their families. The men gave no dominant reasons, but shop-
ping was mentioned alone or in conjunction with other things  by 
6o  per cent,  and 37  per cent mentioned relatives. 

53·  Seventy  per  cent  who  missed  the  neighborhood  also  missed  the 
city,  but 32  per cent who did not miss  the city  were lonely for  the 
neighborhood. Some  people missed  the city but not the neighbor· 
hood;  they were primarily short-term residents, well-educated peo-
ple,  Jews,  mixed-marriage  partners,  and  ethnic  group  members 
who lacked  their own  neighborhood  (for  example,  Albanians). 
54·  Judging  by  their  responses,  they  did  not  miss  the  row  house  as 
such, but were using  the question to complain about high heating 
bills  in Levittown. 

55·  Thus, 75  per cent of those not completing high school, 70  per cent 
of  those  who  had  attended  college,  but  only  41  per cent  of  high 
school  graduates  chose  the  city.  Women  who  had  formerly  lived 
with  their parents and would have  preferred  the  city  if they  had 
been childless seem  to imply that conflicts about how to raise  the 
children  must  have  caused  considerable  trouble  in  the  three· 
generation home. 

56.  Levittowners who  missed  the  city  wanted  to  move  back  without 

children, but those who missed  people there did not. 

The  Impact  of  the  Community 

•  301  • 

57·  Sixty-five  per  cent  of  the  sample offered  suggestions,  and  women 
did so more than mep. It should be remembered that the interview 
took  place  before  department  stores  and  a  movie  theater  were 
built in the Levittown shopping center.  Another reason  given  by 
women for  wanting to live in  the city was job opportunities. 
58.  Thirty-seven  per -cent  of  the  former  urbanites  dislike  Levittown, 
and  the  same  proportion  of  former  suburbanites  do.  Among 
tenth· and  twelfth-graders,  49  per  cent  of  former  urbanites  and 
39  per  cent  of  non-urbanites  complain  about  having  nothing 
to do. 

59·  The  description  was  as  follows:  "Now,  I  want  you  to  imagine  a 
row house,  not  the kind built in Philadelphia, but a  modern one, 
with a  3o-foot front,  and with the same  amount of space,  the same 
layout, and same general design  as  your Levitt house.  It would be 
just like your present house,  except  that it would be a  row house. 
It would be built in rows of four on streets just like those in Levit-
town,  and in a community just like  Levittown in  all  other ways." 
The  questions  were:  "A.  Suppose  you  had  a  choice  between 
your present house and this modern suburban row house,  but the 
row  house  was  only  15  minutes  from  the  husband's  work;  which 
would you choose?"  "B.  ... (If)  the  row  house was  only  15  min-
utes  away  from  the  stores  and  other  facilities  of downtown  Phil· 
adelphia,  which  would  you  choose?"  "C.  Now  supposing  both 
were  located in Levittown.  If the  row  house  cost  $10oo  less  than 
your  present  house,  which  would  you  choose?"  "Ca. 
.  .  .  how 
about if  the  row  house cost  $2000  less  than your present house?" 
"Cb.  How  much  less  would  the  row  house  have  to  cost  before 
you  would  think seriously  about it?" 

6o.  Five  per cent would  take  the row house  for  $10oo  less,  9  per cent 
more  for  $2ooo  less.  Another 4  per cent  agreed for  half the  price 
of  the  Levitt  house. 

61.  Despite  my  attempt  to  describe  a  superior row  house  model,  the 
respondents were reacting to  the row houses  they had known.  For 
this  reason,  the  Philadelphians,  many  of  whom  had  come  from 
row  houses,  were  not even  asked  this  question. 

62.  For some  hopeful  trends  in  row  house  design,  see  Whyte  (1964).

more  likely  than  urban  ones  to  prefer  suburban  residence  once 
they had married. 

68.  I  do  so  for  stylistic  reasons,  but  also  because  I  see  no  major  dif-
ference  between  the  two.  A  planner  is  a  type  of  policy-maker, 
sometimes but not always concerned with long-range change,  and 
a  city  planner  is  a  policy-maker  who  works  inside  community 
boundaries.  When  I  describe  or  criticize  current  city  planning 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

practice,  however,  I  shall  refer  explicitly  to  the  city  planner.

70.  These effects  of a  new  dwelling  unit and  its  greater spaciousness 
were  also  the  most  significant  changes  reported  by  a  sample  of 
slum  dwellers moving into a  new public housing project. Wilner 
et al.,  Chap.  10. 

71.  Stability is not, however, intrinsic to home ownership; Transients 
may not feel  it, and tenants may feel  it as much as  owners if they 
expect to live in the apartment and neighborhood for a  long time 
-for example, the West Enders I  studied and  Manhattanites. 
72.  An  exception  is  the  wading  pool,  where  mothers  talk  to  others 

while watching their small children. 

73·  The minority  churches  tended  to  attract  people  from  the neigh-
borhood  in  which  they  were  ~ocated,  and  insofar  as  they  made 
friends at church, were thus limited to their own neighborhood. 
74·  The size  of living rooms  and  the cost of entertaining also  play  a 

limiting role. 

75·  Even  so,  there  were  class  differences.  For  example,  only  21  per 
cent of the  purchasers of the cheapest house had graduated from 
college, as compared to 30 per cent of those in the medium-priced 
one and 48  per cent in the most expensive. 

76.  It was  infinitesimal,  for  example, when compared to what Young 
and Willmott (Chap.  10)  found  in a  new  English  housing estate, 
where almost the entire population sat and suffered in individual 
loneliness  for  several  years,  unable  to  break  the  ice  even  with 
next-door neighbors. 

77·  In most American cities,  the new downtown high-rise apartments 
attract  a  disproportionate  number  of Jews.  Abu-Lughod,  p.  4o6 
and Fenmore. Fenmore reports on his unpublished study of a sam-
ple of suburban home owners near Philadelphia who,  for  various 
reasons,  might  be  prospective  residents  of  downtown  apartment 
buildings. He writes:  "The significant finding of the study is  that 
almost  all  of  the  suburban  non-Jews  . . .  wished  to  remain  in 
their single-family  homes,  whereas  the overwhelming majority of 
Jews either wished to or were actually planning to move into new 
urban high-rise apartments."

(tg62b).

IN  PART  ONE  OF  THIS  BOOK  I  CONCLUDED  THAT  THE  ORIGIN  OF  THE 
community was determined more by  the events which  took place 
after its founding than by prior planning, and more by the people 
than  by  their  leaders.  In  Part  Two  I  suggested  that  people's 
lives  were  also  shaped  by  what happened  in  Levittown,  particu-
larly  by  the  other  people  they  encountered.  These  conclusions 
lead  logically  to  a  related  question:  To what  extent do  govern-
ment  and  politics  reflect  the  goals  and  priorities  of  the  people, 
and to  what extent those  of the tlecision-makers,  the  elected  and 
appointed  officials,  party  leaders,  and  influential  interests  who 
affect  and  make decisions  in  the name of  the  people?  This then 
raises  the  question  of  whether  or not government should  be  re-
sponsive to the people and, if so,  how much. 

THE  STRUCTURE  OF POLmCAL  COMMUNICATION 

At  one  level  these  questions  are  about  political  communication 
between  decision-makers  and  citizens;  the  responsiveness  of  the 
former  to  the  latter  and  the  feedback  from  the  latter  to  the 
former.  In  a  democratic  community  the  functioning  of  the 
decision-makers  is  affected  by  two  obvious  facts  of  life:  that  the 
voters  have  a  life-and-death  power  over  government  through 
their periodic visits  to the ballot box; and that between elections, 
they take only a  minor role  in government,  so  that their feelip.gs 
about  its  decisions  are  unknown  and  unpredictable.  Even  so, 
government must be responsive  to  the citizenry;  the  people who 

•  305  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

run  for  office  want  to  be  elected,  and  the  political  party  can 
flourish  only  if  its  candidates  win.  The  candidates  themselves 
want  to be responsive  too,  at least in Levittown, where being an 
elected  official  is  a  part-time  job.  As  a  result  they  are and  wish 
to remain  amateur  politicians,  running  for  office  not  simply  to 
further  political  careers  but for  personal  goals  (like  bathing  in 
the public spotlight) and for social  ones (to do what they  think is 
best for  the community).  Being amateurs,  they believe that doing 
good  is  largely  a  matter  of  having  the  right  intentions--which 
they  usually  feel  they  have.  Indeed,  much  campaign  disagree-
ment  is  a  result  of  differences  among  equally  well-intentioned 
people over just what is best. 

Once  elected,  however,  the  candidates'  behavior  changes  con-
siderably.  Now they are part of a  political system which can make 
decisions only by minimizing response to and feedback from citi-
zens and by not raising (or taking stands on) issues.  Only by keep-
ing public disagreement to a  minimum can  it function as  a  bro-
ker and synthesizer between conflicting interest groups and voter 
blocs. 1  In  other  words,  candidates  become  what  Levittowners--
like  most  Americans  in  other  communities-deprecatingly  call 
"politicians."  The reasons  for  thi-s  change  are  quite  simple.  Be-
tween elections,  the government gets little feedback,  for the aver-
age  citizen neither communicates with  the government nor is  in-
terested  in  the  government's  communicating  with  him.  All  de-
cision-makers  in  Levittown,  whether  elected  or  appointed, 
whether  in  municipal  government,  the  school  system,  or  any 
other  public agency,  invariably  reported  that  only  a  handful  of 
citizens  ever  approached  them  to  discuss  their  decisions  or  to 
make  requests.  Meetings  of  elected  bodies  are  poorly  attended, 
and even public hearings usually draw badly, except when a fight 
is  in the offing.  As a  result,  the elected official gets feedback from 
only a  few  people:  those  personally and directly affected  by gov-
ernment  decisions,  especially  those  deprived-and  therefore  an-
gered-by current and proposed actions. 

The lack of citizen communication and attendance is  not a  re-
sult of apathy but of two other factors.  First,  most governmental 
activities simply do not touch  the  everyday lives and concerns of 
the citizenry.  Most Township Committee decisions dealt with in-
ternal matters, of interest only to it and its staff, with meeting the 
requirements of county and state governments,  and with  satisfy-
ing  requests  for  approvals  and  licenses  from  the  builder  and 

Political  Communication

businessmen.  School  board agenda were similarly removed from 
parental concerns with the school. In addition, many people were 
hesitant  to  communicate  with  elected  officials.  Whether  they 
come  from  large  cities  or small  towns,  people  know  that  politi-
cians  are  not  often  receptive  to  criticism,  that  they  will  usually 
respond  in  vague  generalities,  and  that  only  rarely  can  they  be 
really helpful with individual requests. 

The  politicians'  reluctance  to  pay attention  to  the citizenry is 
not  caused  by  disdain  or  lack  of  interest,  however,  but  by  the 
very  sparseness  of  citizen  communication  and  participation.  If 
most  people do not participate most of the time,  and if  the com-
munity  is  at  all  heterogeneous  (and  most  communities  are), 
those  citizens  who  do  contact  the  decision-makers  will  have 
different and often conflicting interests, and will make contradic-
tory  demands,  some  for  one decision,  others  for  a  diametrically 
opposed one.2  This conflict  places  the  decision-makers  in  a  diffi-
cult and nearly impossible  position,  for  they can make  only one 
decision.  Consequently,  whatever  they  say  and  do  will  alienate 
someone, and their wisest course is  to listen as little (or at least as 
impassively)  as  possible,  and  to  say  and  do  even  less.3  Since  the. 
angry citizen  is  more  likely  to remember his grudges at election 
time than the happy one his satisfaction, it is to the politicians' ad-
vantage  to  be noncommittal.  But they are also faced  with uncer-
tainty;  they cannot help displease some citizens,  yet without ade-
quate feedback they rarely know how many and who will remem-
ber till  the next election.  But their problem is  much closer than 
even the next election. If they  talk publicly and freely  about the 
decisions  they must make and what they are thinking, they open 
themselves to immediate attack from  whichever side feels  its case 
is being given short shrift and from the opposition party, which is 
always  looking for disgruntled citizens and campaign issues.  And 
if  they  exposed  themselves  to  continual  feedback,  each  side 
would bombard them with demands and arguments and no deci-
sion could ever be reached. 

Communication  is  also  inhibited by what might be called  the 
norm of altruistic democracy.  According to this norm, a keystone 
of popular democratic theory, citizens enter government to serve 
their fellows and the public interest. They are expected to be im-
partial, altruistic servants of the citizenry, sure of how the public 
interest  is  to  be  defined,  who  make  morally  proper  decisions 
without concern  for  interest groups,  for  voter  blocs,  or for  their 

•  soB  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

own  and  their party's political  future.  Since act.ual  decisions can 
rarely  avoid  such  considerations,  however,  practicing  altruistic 
democracy  would  not  enable  decision-makers  to  perform  their 
duties.  Yet  if the actual decision-making process were  made  pub-
lic,  the  decision-makers  would  immediately  be  attacked  as  im-
moral, self-seeking, and "political." With the opposition  party al-
ways lying in wait for a campaign issue, the decision-makers' only 
solution  is  to  hide  the actual  process  from  both  their opponents 
and the public. 

The  deviation  between  the  normative  and  actual  decision-
making process would not become a campaign issue,  of course, if 
the  citizens did  not embrace  altruism  in  government.  Although 
they may sense  that the theory does not work, many are neverthe-
less  hopeful  that  when  the  incumbent rascals  are  turned  out at 
the next election, things will  be different.  Indeed, voters are sen-
sitive  to  personalities  rather  than  issues  because,  in  addition  to 
lacking  interest  in  most  issues,  they  are  looking  for  a  candidate 
they can  trust  to  act  according  to  the  normative  model.  Experi-
enced  politicians  cater  to  this  in  their  campaigning,  trying  to 
prove  that  the  opposition  candidate  is  self-seeking whereas  their 
own is altruistic. The voters'  ability to "believe" and  to  be suspi-
cious at the same  time  is  deeply  imbedded  in  the  country's cul-
tural  heritage.  Americans are convinced that  the normative con-
ception  of democracy is  viable,  and  that it  is  not put  into opera-
tion  because  of  the  corruptibility of the  politician.  At  the  same 
time,  however,  they  also  identify  their  own  point  of  view-and 
their  own  interests--as  altruistic,  the  opposition  as  selfish,  and 
the  politician as  a  hero or a  villain depending on which side  his 
decision falls. 

Ultimately,  this conception  of the political  process stems from 
people's lack of involvement in government.  If they participated 
in its activities,  they would soon realize how  the decision-making 
process works and why so.  They might not give  up their faith  in 
altruism,  but they would somehow adjust their thinking to allow 
them to be able to function in government, just as  they do in or-
der to  function  in  the  midst  of office  and  factory  politics on  the 
job.  Moreover,  in a community like Levittown most officials  and 
party workers are not professional  politicians, and so  share the at-
titudes of the ordinary citizen.• They may  understand the neces-
sity of "politics"  in their own  agency  or party,  but  they  explain 

Political  Communication 

the  actions  of  the  opposition  as  a  violation  of altruistic  democ-
racy.11 

The selective participation of citizens in government and their 
belief that it ought  to  be run  by altruistic norms  forces  the gov-
ernment  to  protect  itself  from  its  constituents.  The  individual 
decision-maker  restricts  feedback  and  response,  but  this  is  not 
sufficient,  for  if a  politician suddenly decided to seek  greater  po-
litical  support by  becoming more  responsive  to  his  constituents, 
his  colleagues  would  have  to  follow  suit, and as  soon  as  conflict-
ing demands were evoked,  the decision-making process would be 
back in the same impasse. 

Consequently,  government  must  develop  institutional  means 
to shield itself from  the citizens.  In Levittown  (and  I  suspect ev-
erywhere  else)  it  does  so  by  creating  two  governments,  a  per-
forming and an actual  one.  The government with which  the de-
cision-makers  confront  the  citizens  is  a  performing government; 
its  actions  are  performances  that  follow  altruistic  democratic 
theory. 6  The stage,  designed  according to  this  theory and  legiti-
mated  by  state  and  local  statutes,  is  the  public  meeting  of  the 
governing  body,  where  decision-makers  listen  to  citizens'  opin-
ions  and  then  appear  to  vote  on a  final  decision  on  the  basis  of 
what they have heard.  But this  is  only a  performance, for  the de-
cision  has  already  been made "backstage,"  in the secret delibera-
tions  of  the  actual  government. 7  In  Levittown,  its  major  com-
ponents are the caucus and the political party. 

The caucus  is  a  private  arena  where  decision-makers  can  de-
bate and agree on the decisions which  they then announce at the 
public  performance.  The political  party provides  the  individual 
decision-maker  with  the  support  he  needs  to  function  in  both 
performing  and  actual  governments.  The  elected  government, 
open  to public inspection and liable to  turnover with every elec-
tion, is socially and psychologically an extremely unstable base of 
operations. The individual decision-maker, like any other human 
being,  needs  an  institution in which  he  plays  a  permanent role, 
can  make a  career,  can  be rewarded  and  promoted  for  successes 
(but  be  retained  if  he  should  fail  temporarily),  and-most  im-
portant-where he can associate with people he can trust. Even in 
the government caucus, he can never be totally open with his col-
leagues,  some of whom may represent  present or future  political 
opposition. 

•  310  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

The party aids him in yet another crucial way. If he is to be re-
elected,  his  decisions  must  reflect,  at  least  to  some  extent,  the 
wishes  of  his  constituents.  Since  he  is  restricted  in determining 
these  wishes,  the  party  provides  a  service  to  him  by  gathering 
feedback  about  citizens'  ideas  and  feelings  through  its  party 
workers.  More  important,  it  offers  him  another,  simpler,  crite-
rion for decision-making-the welfare of the party. Since its wel-
fare  is,  like  his  own,  based  on  its  ability  to  win  elections,  the 
party becomes a responsible partner in the decision-making proc-
ess.  Indeed,  often  the  elected  official  is  only  a  representative-
sometimes  even  an  errand  boy-who carries  the  decision  of the 
party  leadership  or caucus  back  to  the  government  caucus. 

The constituents who have  definite  opinions on  the decisions 
government should make or who demand  government action  in 
.their behalf are, ()f course, excluded from  both caucuses. Even so, 
they must attempt to get around the performing government and 
reach  the  actual  one,  or  rather,  to  communicate  with  the  per-
fonning politician  in such a  way  that their message  will  be con-
sidered by the actual government. Those who represent powerful 
interest groups and voter blocs have easy access to the actual gov-
ernment,  but the  powerless  groups  have  considerable  difficulty 
and  must  devise  techniques  that compel  the  actual  goveFnment 
to pay attention. Such groups can put on their own performance, 
stating  their  viewpoint  in  public  so  that  the  decision-makers 
must acknowledge it, or they can bring a  large number of citizens 
to the public meeting,  putting on a  show of strength to persuade 
the decision-makers to take them into account. If they know that 
they are  not reaching the  actual  government,  they can  put on a 
counterperformance.  They may  get  up at  a  public  hearing and 
ask  the  decision-makers  a  series  of  questions  to  which  they  al-
ready  know  the  answers,  hoping  that  the  counterperfonnance 
will gain them sympathy from other constituents and thus add to 
their  strength.  They  may  also  try  to  make  the  decision-makers 
look . foolish  or  contradict  themselves,  aiming  to  show  that  the 
whole operation is  a  performance and  that the real decisions are 
made elsewhere. This too is  intended to gain outside support, es-
pecially  from  among  those  who  believe  in  altruistic  democracy. 
Finally, they may try to force  the decision-makers into a  perform-
ance break, generating so much pressure that the latter lose  their 
poise,  depart from  the previously agreed-on  decision,  and  prom-
ise  publicly  to  support  the  protesters.  They  are  now  not  only 

Political  Communication 

•  811  • 

committed  t~ a  position  they  must  take  in  the  actual  govern-
ment,  but they  have  also  revealed  the  performance  and  thereby 
ended it temporarily.  Protesting citizens continually seek  to cre-
ate  enough  disagreement  and  conflict  to  end  the  performance 
and  force  the  actual  government  to  reveal  itself;  the  decision-
makers  try  to  prevent conflict  so  that  they  can  maintain  the  se-
crecy of the actual government and preserve  their freedom from 
pressure. 

Most  people,  including  even  the  decision-makers  themselves, 
are not entirely aware of the existence of performing and actual 
governments.8  Nevertheless  they  sense  it,  for  they  know  that 
politicians "talk out of both sides of their mouths," promise one 
thing and do another,  and cannot be  trusted. Although  their de-
scriptions  are  couched  in moral  terms,  they are  referring  to  the 
deviation  between  the  politician's  performing  and  actual  roles. 
Of course, performances are usually considered deceitful, and the 
term  itself  is  derogatory,  but  I  do  not  use  it  in  this  sense.  It 
should be clear that I consider the performance a real and intrinsic 
part of American politics, and although by no means desirable, it 
is  probably  impossible  to  eliminate  except  through  a  radical 
(and  quite  unlikely)  change  in  the  citizen-government  relation-
ship. In any case,  I  do not mean my observations to be read as  an 
expose  of  the  "immorality"  of  American  governments,  local, 
state, or federal, for politics is too complex to be judged by norms 
of personal or familial relationships. 

The Functions of the  Performing Govemment 

A  primary  function  of  the  performance  is  reducing  uncer-
tainty.  When  everything  rides  on  the  next  election,  every  de-
cision-indeed,  every  act  of  government--am  result  in  unpre-
dictable  consequences.  In  a  suburban  community,  where  many 
voters are  independents,  neither  party  can count  on a  sufficient 
number of loyal  adherents who will  support it regardless  of the 
candidates or the issues,  and  there are too few  patronage jobs  to 
provide workers  and assured votes.  In a  new community,  uncer-
tainty is even greater, for no one knows the voters well enough to 
predict  how  they  will  vote,  and  strangers  may  get  up at  public 
meetings  and  throw  them  into an  uproar.  Also,  when  organiza-
tions are hurrying to establish  themselves,  normative democracy, 
which  posits  open  discussion,  means  inevitable  delays.  If  just 
enough democracy can be incorporated to mollify those who feel 

•  312  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

it is  as  important as getting things done, then  the actual  practice 
of democracy can be avoided. Whether the group is new or estab-
lished,  the  expression  of democratic  dissent  is  evidence  of con-
flict,  and  this  is  often  interpreted  as  a  sign  of organizational  in-
effectiveness.  A  proper  performance,  on  the  other  hand,  creates 
an  image  of efficiency  and skill.  Consequently,  government  tries 
to exclude uncertainty and open conflict from  the political  proc-
ess  wherever it can, and to plan and "stage" all  its activities. 

Particular care  is  taken  in  the  staging  of confrontations  with 
citizens.  Open meetings of public bodies are run with an agenda, 
which  functions  much  like  a  script.  In  fact,  when  the  school 
board  was  still  composed  of  old  residents,  the  superintendent 
prepared a virtual script, enabling the board members to read all 
their remarks off  the agenda, except for  their votes.  The mainte-
nance  of  the  performance  is  enhanced  by  local  and  state  ordi-
nances,  and by Robert's  Rules of Order,  which  make  it difficult 
for  the audience to question  the decision-makers.  In New Jersey, 
the  local  governing  body  is  not  even  legally  obligated  to  hear 
citizens at its regular meetings,  but  Levittown's Township Com-
mittee  allowed  them  to  speak.  Its counsel  acted as  a  gatekeeper, 
however,  using  the  laws  governing  public  meetings  to  cut  off 
comments that might erupt into argument and endanger the per-
formance. 

The main opportunity for people to offer feedback  is  the pub-
lic  hearing,  but  it  too  is  set  up  as  a  performance.  Citizens  can 
make  speeches  and  offer  testimony,  but questioning of the  deci-
sion-makers  is  discouraged.  The latter sit on the podium and lis-
ten  (or  appear  to  listen),  absorbing  testimony  without  any  re-
sponse,  so  as  not  to  indicate  how  they  are  going  to  vote.  Dur-
ing  my  study,  the  public  bodies  had  decided  how  to  vote  be-
fore  the  public  hearing,  and simply sat  through  it as  a  legal  re-
quirement. Not that they rejected all comments, but usually they 
had heard them before, and the chance of learning anything new 
was small. Yet even if new facts or ideas were presented, and offi-
cials  were  influenced  by what  they  heard,  they  tried to  mask  it. 
The incentives for  maintaining this  performance become visi-
ble during the rare occurrences of performance breaks. When the 
ordinance  to  admit  nonresident  doctors  was  in  public  hearing, 
the opponents were  putting intense  pressure  on  the  elected  offi-
cials  to  table  it.  Stung  by  their  angry  remarks,  one  official  sud-
denly announced that he was reversing his position and would go 

Political  Communication 

•  313  • 

back  on  the  caucus  agreement  to  approve  it,  made  before  the 
public hearing. Having neither political ambition nor a firm base 
in  his  party,  he  was  less  insulated  from  pressure  than  his  col-
leagues,  who  tried  to restore  the  performance  by keeping silent. 
His  defection  and  continued  audience  pressure  eventually  also 
forced  them  to  reverse  themselves,  however.  Although  the  per-
formance  break achieved  the  opponents'  demands,  it only  made 
them  angrier,  because  they realized  the  public  hearing had  been 
"cut and dried." The supporters of the ordinance were angry too, 
demanding equal  time at a  later meeting.  New political negotia-
tions  ensued  to  reduce  the  conflict  and  to  construct  a  compro-
mise,  and  later  the  performance  breaker  and  his  colleagues  de-
nied  that  they  had given  in  to  pressure,  their denial  illustrating 
once  more  how  much  trouble  the  break  had  caused  them.9  An-
other  performance  break  took  place  at  a  school  board  meeting, 
when  a  large  number of parents arrived  unexpectedly  to  protest 
the  actions  of  a  teacher.  The  board  members  pointed  out  that 
they  had  not  been  briefed,  meaning  that  without  a  caucus  they 
were  unable  to  prepare  a  performance  demonstrating  that  the 
board had the situation under control and would take the appro-
priate  actions.  The  parents  insisted  on  an  immediate  answer, 
however,  and  the  board  members  had  to  call  on  the  superin-
tendent to make a  statement. This was  a  significant performance 
break  because  it  violated  the  traditional  performance  in  which 
the  school  board  announced  all  policy  decisions  (implying 
thereby  that  it  also  made  them)  and  the  superintendent  spoke 
only when asked for facts and technical detail. 

Experienced  politicians  can  perform  without  letting  on,  but 
nonprofessionals  are  less  expert  and  less  detached.  They  need 
the voters'  approval  more, and are more likely to give  in  to pres-
sure. Seeing themselves as working hard for little financial  or psy-
chological  reward  (few  voters  ever  praise  them),  they  are  espe-
cially sensitive  to  criticism,  and  the  more  strictly  they adhere  to 
the  performance,  the  less  their  chance  of  being  criticized.  One 
elected official  explained  the  necessity  for  the  caucus  as  follows: 
"People  on  the  board  wouldn't  speak  freely  at  public  meetings. 
They serve on a courtesy basis,  and they wouldn't take  that kind 
of punishment,  the  newspaper and  other attacks  that  would  fol-
low if they spoke freely."  Nonprofessionals fear unrehearsed con-
frontations  of  all  kinds.  They  are  apprehensive  about  making 
speeches,  but  these  can  be  written  out and  rehearsed,  and  since 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

people  suspect  overly glib  speakers,  a  poor style  is  not  a  serious 
liability.  Answering  questions  afterwards  is  another  matter.  Ei-
ther uncertainty or evasion  can make  the politician  look  foolish, 
and  if  he  tries  to  answer  openly  he  may  be  trapped  into a  per-
formance break. Professionals, on the other hand, are more adept 
at  maintaining  the  performance,  although  they  need  it  less  psy-
chologically,  being less  threatened  by criticism  and  hostile  ques-
tions. 

A  performance is  most necessary if the actions to be taken pub-
licly  violate  the  democratic  norm.  When  leaders  of  the  two  op-
posing  Republican  party  factions  met  to  make  peace,  new  ap-
pointments to  the party club and executive committee had to be 
arranged,  and an  hour of the meeting was  spent  in planning the 
"deal"  so  that  it  would  not  look like  one  to rank-and-file  mem-
bers.  If important men suddenly resigned  from  party or govern-
ment  posts,  performances  had  to  explain  their  departure.  The 
official  reasons were  usually  "new business duties  which  prevent 
giving sufficient  time  to  the  community,"  to  maintain  the  myth 
that politicians never squabbled or forced out dissidents.  The in-
dividuals concerned could have  told the real  reasons,  but only at 
the cost of losing their remaining party support and ending their 
political careers.  So  could  the groups which  had dismissed  them, 
but only at great political risk;  if the truth had come out, the op-
posing  faction  (or  the  other  party)  could  have  staged  counter-
performances  to  show  that  party  bickering signified  the  leader-
ship's  incompetence.  Although  many Levittowners suspected the 
public explanations for dismissal,  the safest course was  to hold to 
them.  ,Maintaining  the  performance  might  increase  voter  dis-
trust,  but this  was  less  dangerous  than  giving opponents  the  op-
portunity  to  put  on  counterperformances.  And  once  a  false  rea-
son is  given, it can be reiterated ad infinitum until even the most 
skeptical lose interest in questioning it. 

Performances  are  not  restricted  to  small-town  local  govern-
ment;  they are staged by state and national politicians,  including 
Presidents  of  the  United  States,  and  by  executives  of  large  na-
tional corporations as well. A  fascinating example took place dur-
ing  the  1964  Republican  convention,  when  Governor  Scranton 
was  forced 
into  a  per(ormance  break  that  lost  him  what 
little  support  he  had  left  for  the  nomination.  After  criticizing 
Senator  Goldwater  as  impulsive,  he  sent  him  a  letter  attacking 
his  stand  on  several  issues,  using  stronger  language  than  cus-

Political  Communication

tomary among  party colleagues.  When  this  departure  from  nor-
mal  performance was  criticized,  Scranton explained  that the  let-
ter  had  been  written  on  the  spur  of  the  moment,  apowing  the 
Goldwater forces  to describe  him as  impulsive. To I]1ake  matters 
worse,  he  then indicated  that an aide  had drafted  the letter,  and 
that he had signed it without reading it, enabling his  enemies to 
speculate  whether  he  had  ever  written  anything  attributed  to 
him,  and more  important, whether he  ever read what he signed. 
Inevitably, a  Goldwater supporter wondered publicly if Scranton 
would read  the  laws  and  policy  documents  he  had  to  sign  if  he 
became President, putting an end to Scranton's performance por-
traying himself as  an  effective  and  unemotional  decision-maker. 
Of  course,  the  Goldwater  group's  reactions  were  performances 
too;  every politician uses ghost-writers and signs his  name to un-
read documents,  but he maintains the public trust by not admit-
ting  that  either  happens. 10  Once  there  is  a  breach  in  perform-
ance,  trust  quickly  evaporates,  because  people  wonder  whether 
the politician can  take  the  proper actions in a  crisis-including, 
among other things,  maintenance of the necessary  performances. 
The  performance  is  only  one  method  of restricting  feedback, 
and many others are used by decision-makers  in confronting citi-
zens.  For example, if an angry citizen suggests that a decision was 
based on morally doubtful reasons,  they will supply reasons quite 
in keeping with  altruistic democracy.  Unless  the citizen has  ade-
quate information  on  their  real  reasons  (and  he rarely does),  he 
cannot  continue  the  discussion.  If he  appears  frequently,  and 
consistently  questions  actions  and  reasons,  the  decision-makers 
can charge him with being a crank or a "radical," and if he comes 
regularly to voice dissent, his fellow citizens may agree with them. 
If a  large  group  of  citizens  appears  in  opposition,  the  decision-
makers  can  restrict  feedback  by  pointing  out  that  they  were 
elected  to  use  their  own  best  judgment  to  make  decisions  and 
that they will  not be blackmailed into reaching a  decision on the 
basis  of  "pressure,"  a  performance statement  that  is  made  to re-
duce  pressure,  precisely  because  decisions  are  affected  by  it.  To 
discourage  petitioners,  they suggest  the  threat to  the social  order 
that follows  from  "government by petition." Again,  the response 
is  a  performance,  for  if the  petitioning group is  large  and angry 
enough,  its  demands may be taken into consideration even while 
its right to petition is questioned. 

Motivations also count; an individual who voices disagreement 

•  316  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

because of ideological concern and has no personal interest in the 
matter is  likely to be ignored. This is  ironic, because government 
is  supposed  to  be  run  on  an  alrruistic  basis,  but  it  is  also  prag-
matic;  the  decision-makers  know  that  people  without  personal 
stakes  are  not  likely  to  be  interested  very long,  and  their  com-
ments can be rejected. 11  They will also ignore feedback if they be-
lieve  it  is  "political,"  a  performance  staged  by  the  opposition 
party to give  it an  issue  for a  future campaign.  Finally,  the most 
frequent device is  to dismiss all public feedback unless the person 
can  provide  a  legitimate  reason  for  offering  it.  Because  so  few 
people volunteer feedback in public, decision-makers believe that 
those who do only get up "to hear themselves talk"-and the sub-
stance of their remarks can be set aside. 

Of course,  the  decision-makers  do  not reject  all  feedback,  for 
they  must  be  able  to  judge  the  electorate's  m9od  between  elec-
tions.  They  prefer,  however,  to  gather  their  own,  and  to  do  so 
privately, away from  the public arena where it can upset the per-
formance.  This also  enables them  to structure the questions they 
ask  their constituents,  to get specific  reactions  to  the alternatives 
open  to  them  on  crucial  decisions.  More  general  feedback  from 
rank-and-file  citizens  is  collected  mainly  by  the  parties'  district 
representatives.  The  party  leaders  concentrate  on  the  organiza-
tionally  active,  making  sure  that  a  high  party  member  partici-
pates in every major civic and service club. Decision-makers often 
stay late  in  public meetings  to listen  to  people who  want  to  talk 
to  them  and  invite  calls  at  home  or  in  the  office,  thus  screening 
out all  but those concerned enough to stay behind at the end of a 
meeting or to take the trouble of calling. 

But the  major means of discovering what  the  public  is  think-
ing is  by a kind of clinical empathy which produces "anticipatory 
feedback."  As  part  of  his  professional  training,  the  politician 
learns how to understand his constituents-what they want, what 
angers them, and how intensely they feel about issues.  Some  poli-
ticians  have  "empathic  personalities."  By  nature  they  are  mar-
ginal  people,  detached  from  close  ties  (which  makes  them  good 
observers)  and  able  performers,  who  can  draw  people  out  and 
sense  how  their minds  work.  Nevertheless,  most  politicians have 
to learn such skills. They spend most of their waking hours meet-
ing  with  people,  and  thus  gather  a  great  deal  of  information 
about them.  They have  also  learned  to  be  tough-minded,  to  see 
their constituents as  defenders of  their various self-interests,  and 

Political  Communication 

•  317  • 

to  screen  out  the  rhetoric  with  which  voters  confront  them. 
Moreover,  successful  politicians  usually~but  not  always-
resemble  their constituents and can  sometimes  use  their own re-
actions  to  an  issue  to  judge how  the  voters feel. 

The  Functions  of the  Actual Government 

The workings of the actual government are hard to fathom,  for 
the caucus meets in total privacy, no minutes are kept, and no out-
siders  are  permitted.  The press cannot attend,  and  I  was  refused 
admission  even  though  I  promised  not  to  publish  anything  on 
what  took  place.  Its  functions  can,  however,  be described  by  its 
origin. When the township was rural, there was no need to divide 
government into performing and actual branches. Since everyone 
knew  everyone  else,  feedback  could  be  anticipated  and  did  not 
have  to  be  solicited  or restricted.  The only  performance was  to 
satisfy  the  statutory  requirement  of  "the  record,"  but  in  a  one-
party community the decision-makers did not require protection 
against  the  voters.  No  caucus  was  needed;  when  disagreements 
arose,  township  officials  could  talk  them  over  informally  and 
make  the  necessary  compromises.  After  Levitt  had  purchased 
land  for  the new community,  the volume of decisions  increased. 
Differences of opinion developed,  and decisions  became raw  ma-
terial for  pro- and anti-Letitt factions embroiled in primary elec-
tion contests.  Additional  people had to be hired, and their quali-
fications  could  not be  discussed  openly without hurting feelings 
or creating grudges that might become campaign issues. The new 
decisions  also  generated controversy,  and as  one old resident ex-
plained,  "People were  in  the audience  who  liked  to  hear  them-
selves  think.  They  kept  interrupting  and  this  made  for  long 
meetings and nothing got done." As a result, the Township Com-
mittee  decided  to  hold  what  it  called  "conference  meetings." 
"We  work  out  our  disagreements  at  the  conference  meetings," 
another  Committee  member  pointed  out.  "We  don't  wash  our 
dirty  linen  in  public."  The  caucus  was  continued  when  the 
Levittowners took over the township government. 

The  importance  of  the  caucus  was  illustrated  in  1961,  when 
the  Township  Committee  consisted  of  two  Republicans  and  a 
Democrat.  The  latter,  realizing  that  he  was  a  losing  minority, 
decided  to  make  political  capital  from  it.  One day  he  suddenly 
announced  the  existence  of  the  caucus  and  his  "resignation" 
from  this  secret  and  therefore  undemocratic  body.  Although  he 

•

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

departed  in  well-publicized  indignation,  he  returned  quietly  a 
few  weeks  later.  Given the widespread lack of interest in govern-
mental  activities  at  the  time,  no  public  outcry  followed  his  ex-
pose, and his absence only kept him out of the actual government. 
The Board of  Education  delayed  instituting  the caucus  until  its 
factions  disagreed  so  much  that  it had  no  other choice.  A  year 
later,  when control  of  the  board  was  taken  over  by  two  cosmo-
politans from  the  Citizens Association  for  Public  Schools,  it was 
dropped  as  undemocratic,  but  with  many  controversial  matters 
on  the agenda  so  much  time was  spent on debate  that few  deci-
sions were made. When community leaders began to say  that the 
board was unable to make up its mind and that its members were 
acrimonious,  the  caucus  was  restored.  Backstage,  disagreement 
was  reduced,  for without an audience, minority factions  and po-
litically  ambitious  board  members  could  not  put  on  a  show  of 
intransigence  to  impress  their  supporters.  Arguments  did  not 
end, however, even at public meetings, for the board was  too split 
on some issues  to maintain a  harmonious  performance. 

The  party  plays  many  roles  in  the  actual  government.  Party 
caucuses  precede  governmental  ones  and constantly  remind  the 
decision-makers  that  their  individual  decisions  must  be  woven 
into a  pattern that can  be used in election campaigns  to remind 
the forgetful  voter and  provide him with  an  image of the  party. 
The  party  workers  act  as  brokers  between  the  party  and  the 
voters between elections, doing favors  and providing an entree to 
the actual government for  individuals with personal requests. Al-
though  modern  political  science  theory  has  it  that  the  service-
giving functions of the political  party are unnecessary  in  middle 
class  communities,  this  is  not  entirely  true.  The  district  leader 
tells  citizens  which  agencies  of  government  can  help him;  he  is 
available in  the everting when government offices are closed, and 
can even  offer  to  process a  request when the citizen  cannot  take 
time off from  work  to go  to city hall.  If a  citizen is  in  trouble, a 
kind  word  with  the  police  or  the  judge  cannot  hurt,  even  if  it 
cannot  help  very  much.  And  when  unemployment  strikes,  the 
politician may be able to come  up with a  temporary government 
job  or  a  business  contact  who  is  looking  for  workers.  Since 
elections are sometimes won by a  small margin,  the goodwill  cul-
tivated  by  the district  leader  may  be decisive.12 

Party workers  also  function  as  a  micro-electorate,  as  stand-ins 
to test issues and candidates. If a candidate does not go over with 

Political  Communication 

•  319  • 

the  party workers,  he  is  unlikely  to attract  the voters,  and  if he 
wins  the workers'  favor,  they  will  try  harder  to get him  elected. 
Workers  make  good  candidates,  because  of  their  party  loyalty. 
Since  a  candidate,  once  elected,  is  formally  free  to arrive  at  his 
own  decision,  the  party can advise and cajole,  but it cannot dic-
tate  his actions.  If the official  is  a  loyal  party man,  however,  the 
party can be sure of some influence in the workings of the actual 
government. 

But the party's main function is campaigning. In a community 
of  independents,  every  vote  is  unpredictable  and  campaigning 
never ceases. The formal election campaigns are of course crucial, 
for while they are performances, they decide the fate of the actual 
government. The party needs a  good performer, a candidate who 
acts  like  a  winner  to  enthuse  the  workers  and  who  can  attract 
loyal  and  independent  voters.  The  voters,  particularly  the  un-
committed,  look  for  candidates whom  they can  trust as  persons, 
and who would do  the right thing for  them  in case  they became 
interested in an issue or had to request a favor. 

Voter  demands  result  in  a  campaign  which  concentrates  on 
personalities  and  party  images.  Personal  qualities  are  hard  to 
stage,  so that a  candidate must come across  as  stable, moral, hon-
est, and trustworthy. For this reason, any hint of personal scandal 
is  enough  to  exclude  a  polential  nominee.  Divorce,  especially 
among women, is construed as a sign of instability and is a  handi-
cap  even  with  non-Catholic  voters.  So  is  a  sexually  attractive 
woman  candidate.  Other women  will  oppose  her  for  fear  their 
husbands will  vote  for  her sexual  charm;  men,  for  fear  that she 
will use her attractiveness politically and throw government into 
an  uproar.  Dedication  to  altruistic  democracy  and  the  commu-
nity's welfare is  a  must, and a  previous history of service in com-
munity organizations and in church is required as evidence. The 
candidate who dwells  on  the community's  troubles  may  be con-
sidered  overly  pessimistic;  the  voters  seem  to  want  an  optimist 
who feels  problems are solvable.  In a community like Levittown, 
the candidate must be a  family man, with somewhat more school-
ing  than  the  voters  but not  too  much  more. 13  Candidates show 
off their families,  and  the campaign literature provides  informa-
tion about their education and occupation, allowing the voters to 
judge if they are in similar circumstances, and therefore likely to 
understand  them and act on  their behalf.  For example, a  house-
wife with a large brood of children and a  blue collar worker hus-

•  320  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

band  needed  few  speet::hes  to  persuade  the voters  that she  would 
vote to keep taxes low. Speeches are only words and promises, but 
personal  characteristics  are  undeniable  evidence.14  The  school 
board candidacy of a very popular but childless  Levittowner was 
questioned,  the  feeling  being  that without children of  his  own, 
he  might  not  represent  parents  properly.  This  set  of  criteria 
tends  to  select young,  lower middle class  people,  and encourages 
salesmen-but not high-pressure ones-to run for office.15 

Much  of  the  campaigning  is  devoted  to  presenting  the candi-
dates  as  people,  wherever  possible  through  direct  and  informal 
confrontations  with  the  voters.  The  rest  consists  of  an  endless 
stream  of  press  releases  proclaiming  the  moral  virtues  of  one 
party and its opposition's corruption. Party public relations men, 
hired  for  the  duration  of the campaign,  spend  their time  taking 
apart  the  opposition's  every  move  and  every  statement  to  find 
charges. As a result, the campaign becomes a constantly escalating 
morality play,  with  each  party attacking the other for  acts which 
both  would carry out without a  second  thought  if  they were  po· 
litically desirable and  if  the  party were  protected  by  the  privacy 
of  the  actual  government.  For  example,  in  the  fall  of  1959,  the 
Democrats  attacked  the  Republican  incumbent  for  "running a 
political  employment  agency"  by  appointing  relatives  and 
friends  to  township  posts,  then  a  standard  procedure  among the 
old resident elite. The Republican target described the charge as 
"tragically  humorous"  and  "stupid,"  pointing  out  that  the 
Township Committee, rather  than he personally, appointed peo-
ple,  and  that in any case,  no new residents were available for ap-
pointments.  The  Democrats  promptly called  his  statement  "tra-
gically  unfunny,"  accused  the  Republicans  of  only  appointing 
other  Republicans,  and  charged  that  unqualified  local  people 
were being named to jobs for which experienced outsiders should 
be  found. 16  At  this  point,  the  Republican  declared  that  "he 
would  engage  in  no  more  political  infighting,"  and  that  "these 
assaults  have  been  directed  at  me  for  purely  political  reasons." 
He described himself as  being "township administrator" and said 
he  had  "neither the  time nor  the  inclination to engage  in  politi-
cal  rr,  .. dslinging."  Then a  Republican candidate for  minor office 
took over the attack, accusing the Democrats of operating a polit-
ical  machine  and  waging  a  "smear  campaign,"  and  called  on 
them  to  "stick  to  issues  and  cease  resorting  to  personalities." 
"We," he continued, "are running on a  sound platform of prog-

Political  Communication 

•  321  • 

ress  for  the  best  interests  of  the  community."  The  Democratic 
leader promptly responded by calling the smear "ridiculous." He 
added,  "If  that  were  the  best  that  the  Republican  candidates 
could offer in the way of press releases,  then their campaign must 
be  pretty  barren  of  intelligent  thinking."  He  pointed  out  that 
lacking patronage jobs the Democrats could not possibly build a 
machine,  and  then  repeated  the  political  employment  agency 
criticism, arguing that it was  "a charge we  supported with facts." 
He  concluded  by  pointing  out  that  the  Democrats  had  offered 
constructive  recommendations,  whereas  the  Republicans  said 
''that Levittown  is  a  nice  town,  but not a  word about what  they 
propose  to  do  to  keep  it  that  way."  The  Republicans  then  an· 
nounced  a  ten-point  program  to  "continue  the  best  features  of 
past and  present  programming." 17 

These  exch~nges are  ritual  performances,  not  expected  to  be 
read by  the mass  of voters and put on in the vain  hope that they 
may persuade a  few  naive ones. 18  They serve  no significant func-
tion except to offer constant evidence of the existence of the  per-
forming  government  (and  to  uphold  the  norms  of  altruistic  de-
mocracy),  but they are  perpetuated because  they take  little effort 
and  might just sway  the  small  number  that constitutes  the  mar-
gin  of  victory.  The  absence  of  evidence  on  the  progress  of  the 
campaign forces  both parties to  use every  possible  technique and 
opportunity to change the voters'  minds, and once one party sets 
off a  volley of charges,  the  ~her must retaliate,  for  silence could 
be an admission  of guilt and would  be  so  interpreted in the  op-
position's next press release. 

The  entire  process  is  less  a  conspiracy  by  the  parties  to  put 
over  their candidates  than an attempt, however fumbling,  to an-
ticipate  the demands  of  the  electorate.  The only  point at which 
the parties refuse  to respond to  these demands is  in taking stands 
on  major  issues.  Taking stands  is  divisive  and can  lose  as  many 
votes  as  it gains,  and  the  parties do not even force  each  other to 
do  so,  for  that  tactic  would  only  boomerang;  the  challenging 
party would  also  have  to  take a  stand.  Instead,  both limit  them-
selves  to  generalities,  noncontroversial  issues  like  civil  service, 
and those controversial ones which are already identified with the 
party  position  and  image.  On  the  rare  occasions  when  many 
voters are, however,  interested in an issue,  they pressure  the can-
didates  and  parties  to  take  a  stand.  For  example,  at  one  candi-
dates'  night  for  the  school  board  election,  the  hopefuls  were 

•  322  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

asked  whether  or  not  they  would  vote  for  the  school  budget. 
Those  without  further  interest  in  public  office  answered  freely, 
but  one  politically  ambitious  man  explained  candidly  that  he 
had not yet decided,  for  either a  yes  or no would lose  him votes. 
The  audience rejected  his answer  and  made  him  promise  to  an-
nounce  a  decision  publicly,  which  he  did  after  days  of  feverish 
conferences with his advisers. 

The  election  is  the  point  of  maximum  communication,  feed-
back, and response, and once it is  won or lost,  these end abruptly. 
But even then, feedback is limited. People can only vote for  a can-
didate,  and  unless  he runs  on  one  specific  issue,  the  meaning of 
the  vote  remains  uncl~ar. If the  party  in  power  is  turned  out, 
people  are  obviously  discontented,  but  no  one  knows-or  can 
prove-the  specific  gripes,  who  shares  them  and  how  intensely. 
Unless  there is  a  single  overriding issue  of deep and widespread 
concern,  the  electorate has  not been able  to  tell  the  government 
what decisions it wants,  if any;  it has only chosen decision-~akers 
who  resemble  it  in a  variety  of  personal characteristics and who 
have  promised  to  do  their  best  for  it  and  the  commu"nity.  The 
diffuseness of the feedback is  of course advantageous for  the new 
officeholders;  it frees  them  to fupction  in  the actual  government 
and to adapt their decisions with an eye  to the next election. 

THE  ROLE  OF  THE  PRESS 

Political communication is  not restricted to government and ..:iti-
zens alone;  the  press also  plays a  role. 19  In theory,  it is  independ-
ent  of  government  and  politics,  but  in  practice  it  is  not,  even 
contributing to feedback  restriction somewhat by its  tendency to 
report  the  activities  of  the  performing  government.  Ironically, 
the  reporters  are  interested  in  just  the  opposite;  their  profes-
sional norms,  their prestige, and their feeling of accomplishment 
are nurtured by debunking performances and by describing what 
happened  backstage,  although  they  too  believe  in  altruistic  de-
mocracy, and their reportage of the actual government often em-
phasizes  its deviation from  democratic norms.  This is  the essence 
of the expose.  But the journalist and  his  newspaper are  also  part 
of the  political  institution.  Publishers and editors are sometimes 
party  or  government  decision-makers  and  often  influential  be-
hind  the  scenes. 20  Even  when  this  is  not  the  case,  the  reporter 

Political  Communication 

becomes  involved  in a  relationship with  his  news  sources  which 
ultimately forces  him to cover the performing rather than the ac-
tual government. 

The  decision-makers  want  no  news  spread  about  the  actual 
government, and if a reporter crosses  them, he incurs their hostil-
ity  (or  at  least  loses  their  confidence)  and  may  be  punished  by 
not  being given  good  stories  in  the  future.  Yet  if  the  reporter 
limits his  coverage  to  the decisions and the performances that ac-
company  them,  his  story  will  be  dull  and  uninteresting.  He  is 
thus caught in the middle. If he alienates the decision-makers,  he 
loses  the  only  reliable  source  of  news  about  the  actual  govern-
ment;  if he goes along with them, he will displease his editor and 
his readers.  His only escape hatch is the decision-maker's need for 
him.  If the  decision-maker  punishes  a  reporter  by  withholding 
information,  the  reporter  can  retaliate  by  not  publishing some-
thing the decision-maker wants to get into the paper. 

These conflicts of interest lead to the development of a  system 
of  mutual  obligation  between  reporter  and  decision-maker, 
which  incorporates  the  former  into  the  political  institution  by 
inviting  him  backstage,  but  with  the requirement  that  he  limit 
his  coverage  of  the  actual  government.  The  reporter  learns  all 
(or  almost  all),  but cannot  tell;  the  decision-maker  tells  all  (or 
as  much  as  he  has  to),  but  knows  he  will  not  learn  about  it  in 
next  morning's  paper.  The relationship  is  perhaps  less  a  system 
than  a  tug  of  war,  for  the  decision-maker  is  always  trying  to  re-
veal  as  little as  possible,  and  the reporter attempts  to  publish as 
much as he can without alienating his source.21 

The tug of war begins as soon as  the reporter is  put on the city 
hall  beat.  At  first,  he  gets  only stereotyped  interviews,  but as  he 
hangs around city hall  he picks up bits of unauthorized informa-
tion,  gossip  and rumors,  and gradually begins  to learn about the 
actual  government.  At  this  point,  the  decision-makers  let  him 
step behind the scenes  to tell him what is  happening in the actual 
government, usually warning that it is  not to be published. If he 
does not reveal  off-the-record information (which can be checked 
quickly if his  paper comes out daily or weekly),  he  is  likely to be 
taken  further  into  their  confidence,  and  for  good  reason.  If the 
reporter were not told everything, he might find out anyway, and 
from  hostile sources.  The decision-maker who shares confidences 
can at least be sure that the reporter gets his version of the event. 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

The  reporter  benefits  by  understanding  the  political  scene, 
which helps him make sense of it to his readers even  if  he cannot 
publish all he knows. 

Sometimes  he  can  report  beyond  the  performance,  by obtain-
ing bits of information from  friendly decision-makers he can use 
without  attribution,  or  by  finding  one  who  has  private  reasons 
for  letting himself be quoted.  He can also  speculate,  incorporat-
ing material  that  may  be  far  more  than speculation  among city 
hall  insiders.  His mere presence occasionally makes  it impossible 
to  keep  backstage  information secret;  city hall  insiders  may  talk 
so much about political dissension that rumors about it appear in 
the community, and then  the reporter is  not only free  to cover it 
but  is  almost  forced  to,  in  order  to  show  that  the  press  is  not 
holding back information. When a story is  big,  the reporter may 
risk angering his  sources,  particularly if he knows  they will  need 
him  in  the  future.  He can  also  plead  the  norms of  his  craft,  for 
politicians  know  that  professional  reporters  will  reject  any  de-
mand  for  overt  censorship  or  self-censorship.  Or  he  can  argue 
that competing reporters may publish the story and he cannot let 
them scoop him. 

Even  if  the  reporter writes  an article  the  decision-maker  does 
not like,  the latter cannot criticize too much, for if the reporter is 
angered he may dig deeper, get back at the decision-maker by  re-
vealing confidences,  or obtain damaging material  from  his oppo-
nents. Since  the decision-makers are the most avid readers of city 
hall  news,  a  skillful  newsman can  include such  material  between 
the  lines  without  actually  reporting  it,  thus giving the decision-
maker a signal  to get back on good terms with the reporter before 
he  resorts  to  more  open  coverage.  Of  course,  decision-makers 
have  ways  of  keeping the reporter  in  line,  too. 22  They can  criti-
cize  his  articles  and  shame  him  into  more  friendly  stories,  they 
can  forget  to  invite  him  to  an  important meeting or feed  scoops 
to a competitor, and if necessary  they can complain to the editor 
or publisher, although this will surely cause the reporter to retal-
iate.  They can also  wine and dine him or even  try  to establish a 
social  relationship,  but  the  experienced  reporter  knows  how  to 
avoid these traps. 

The mutual obligation system was nicely illustrated during the 
1g6o  election  campaign  when  the  Levittown  Civic  Association 
sought  to  hold  a  local  version  of  the  Great  Debates.  Local  re-
porters were asked  to question  the  Levittown candidates,  but all 

Political  Communication 

refused.  The dean of the local  press corps explained:  "The ques-
tions  I  really  want  to ask  I  can't ask  in  public,  only  in  private, 
but if I  ask  innocuous questions,  my reputation as  a  newspaper-
man  is  impugned."  Eventually  two  Philadelphia  reporters  who 
covered  Levittown  as  "stringers" and were  not  involved  enough 
in local  affairs  to become part of the system  of obligation agreed 
to serve. 

Over time,  the reporter becomes a  part of the political  institu-
tion,  if only  marginally,  and  his  coverage  begins  to  be selective, 
sometimes deliberately but more often unconsciously.  Getting to 
know  his  major  news  sources  well,  he  forms  likes  and  dislikes 
which cannot help but influence his reporting.  For example, one 
local  reporter  told  me:  "I  would  never  publish  anything  nasty 
.  If he  makes  a  mistake,  either a  political  or a 
about C 
moral  one,  I  tell  him  to  watch  out,  but  I  don't  put  it  in  the 
paper." The reporter also begins to identify with the community, 
omitting uncomplimentary items, and helping people and causes 
he thinks deserve  publicity.21  For instance,  one editor gave extra 
space  to  a  Levittown  organization  and  kept  out stories  of  its  in-
ternal conflicts, because it provided a  worthy community service. 
He  also  proposed  community  programs  he  considered  desirable 
or  necessary,  writing  editorials  about  them  and  creating  news 
stories by feeding his ideas to a community leader and then inter-
viewing him.  In addition  to helping the community, such cover-
age  aided  the  newspaper's  reputation  for  community  service, 
which  in  turn  mi~ht attract  more  advertisers  and  readers.  And 
when news was scarce-an almost constant problem in Levittown 
-planting ideas helped fill  up the pages. 

Of  course,  reporters  also  expressed  personal  prejudices.  One, 
believing  that  elected  officials  deserved  respect,  described  their 
critics  as  rabble-rousers,  thus  supporting  the  governmental  per-
formance  and  preventing  the community from  knowing  the  ex-
tent of dissatisfaction.  He covered  Levittown  only  a  short  time, 
and  was  also  atypical,  for  most  reporters  enjoyed  watching  the 
decision-makers  squirm  under  questioning  and  were  especially 
pleased  to report evasive answers  to critics by those who had also 
evaded  their  questions.  Another  reporter,  also  temporarily  in 
Levittown, remained outside the system of obligation altogether, 
leaving him free  to slant the news  in favor of the Democrats and 
his own point of view on the school budget. 

It must be noted that most of the  time the reporter's coverage 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

is  routine  and does  not  involve  the conflict  with  sources  I  have 
described.  His  everyday work  is  to cover the community and  its 
myriad  events,  and  he  is  not expected  to delve deeply  into  gov-
ernment.  In  a  small  community,  many  decisions  of  the  actual 
government  have  obvious  or  publishable  explanations,  and 
events  that  strain  the  system  of mutual  obligation  are  rare. 

Yet  even  if  that  system  did  not  exist,  coverage  of  the  actual 
government would  still  be difficult.  For one  thing,  reporters are 
not admitted to  caucuses and  must get their  information  second 
and  third  hand.  Accurate  explanations  for  decisions  are hard  to 
come by, for even when a  political event is  not secret it is difficult 
and  time-consuming  to  reconstruct  what  really  happened  and 
why,  requiring  interviews  with  many  people  to  dig out  reasons 
and motivations.  Few  newspapers  have  large enough  staffs  to  do 
such  legwork,  and  in a  small  community  too  many  other events 
must be covered.  The average reporter often  looks  in on several 
governmental  and  organizational  meetings  during  the  same 
night,  even  if  they  provide  little news,  in order  to maintain  his 
rapport with the people in charge. Since politicians and organiza-
tional leaders are quick to object to poor or insufficient coverage, 
the reporter spends much  of his  time on  inconsequential  stories 
which respond  to a  demand from  his most loyal  readers.  Finally, 
few  newspapermen  have  the  training  to  analyze  an  event  or  to 
understand the social  forces  and processes  that lead to a  political 
decision. 

Ideally, in order to give people the kind of information needed 
to  participate  effectively  in  government,  it  (but  particularly  the 
actual  government)  should  be  covered  as  a  serial,  in  which  the 
day-to-day  reportage  is  part  of  an  integrated  analysis.  Over  the 
long run,  the coverage  should show-at least  for  major  issueS-
what  alternatives  were  open  to  decision-makers;  why  these; 
which ones  they chose  when  they had a  choice;  and what  social, 
economic,  and  political  incentives  and  pressures  brought  about 
the choice. This kind of reportage would require a staff of skilled 
and  dispassionate  political  scientists  who  would  not  make  snap 
judgments  about  deviations  from  democratic  norms.  The avail-
able reporters are neither social  scientists nor trained sufficiently 
in  the  social  sciences,  however.  Experienced  hands  know  the 
principles of political strategy,  but even  they rarely focus  on  the 
social  system  and  on  the  processes  which  encourage  or  re-
quire these strategies.  Reporters are,  like their readers,  believers 

Political  Communication 

•  327  • 

in altruistic democracy, which is  one reason why decision-makers 
try  to  keep  them  from  reporting  the activities  of the actual  gov-
ernment.  Of course,  they  are more sophisticated and niore skep-
tical  than  their  readers  and  rarely  cast  politicians  as  heroes  or 
villains  as  quickly  or  as  permanently  as  citizens  do.  Moreover, 
they  are  trained  to· be  objective,  so  that  their  evaluations  are 
often implicit-and generally unconsciously so.  Even so, reporters 
have  political  positions  like  anyone  else,  and  a  close  reading  of 
their  articles  (which  is  carried  out  only  by  the  politicians  they 
cover)  would  reveal  these  positions.  However,  the  value  judg-
ments reporters make are more often based on their personal and 
professional  relationship with  the  politicians  they cover than on 
political  ideology;  they  tend  to  favor  the  cooperative  politician 
and  to  write  negatively  about  the  one  who  makes  their  work 
more difficult. 

But  more  sophisticated  coverage  of  the  actual  government  is 
also  held back by lack of incentives for doing so.  Protests by poli-
ticians may contribute  to  the reporter's pride  that he  has done a 
good  job,  but  they  may  also  get  him  a  warning from  his  editor. 
Professional  rewards for  scrupulous reporting and in-depth anal-
ysis  are rare;  the newspapermen.who work for small-town dailies 
and  weeklies  are  not  read  widely  enough  by  their  professional 
peers  or  in  the  executive  suites  of  top  papers  and  magazines  to 
bring  the  better  job  offers  that  follow  superior  performance  in 
other occupations. 

Still,  the  main  obstacle  to  better  reporting-and  the  main 
withholder of incent1ves--is probably the audience. Many readers 
want  to  know  what  is  happening  in  the  actual  government,  but 
their  interest,  like  their  political  participation,  is  intense  only 
when  a  topic  concerns  them  personally-which  is  why  local  pa-
pers  devote  much  space  to  social  columns.  The rest  of  the  time 
they  are  curious  rather  than  concerned,  reading  the  news  only 
"to keep up with  events."  As  a  result,  Levittown's reporters  and 
editors  received  no  more  feedback  than  the  decision-makers. 
Readers wrote  in  occasionally,  but  as  is  so  often  the  case,  many 
letters came from a few  regular correspondents, some cranks, oth-
ers defined as  cranks simply because they wrote in so persistently. 
For  these  reasons,  letters were  considered a  poor source of  feed-
back.  So  were  circulation  figures,  because  many  papers  are  dis-
tributed  without  charge.  Consequently,  newspapers  know  little 
about their audience and rely on professional  intuition and what 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

they can  pick  up at random  about  its  interest in the news.  Even 
so,  editors  took  audience  interest  into  account,  and  a  matter 
thought  to  be of  minor  interest  would  generally get  little  space 
unless  news  was  in  such  short supply that everything had  to  be 
printed. 

Generally speaking,  an  event was  thought  to  be interesting to 
the readership only if excitement or conflict developed around it. 
For  example,  when  the  builder  persuaded  both  political  parties 
to support a referendum to change the township's name to Levit-
town,  the absence of visible resident opposition led one editor to 
conclude that his readers did not care.  Personally,  he was against 
the  name  change  and  tried  hard  to  find  politicians  who  would 
take a stand against it or give him a quote around which he could 
build a  critical  article.  Unable  to  get  either,  he gave  the  matter 
only routine coverage.  'When  the name  change  was  approved  by 
just a  hundred votes,  he was sorry he had not written about it in 
more detail,  feeling-perhaps justifiably so-that additional  cov-
erage  would  have  produced  the  votes  needed  to  reject  the 
change. 

In  this  instance,  the  editor misjudged  potential  (although  not 
actual)  reader interest,  but normally,  his  paper covered  political 
news in more detail  than Levittowners seemed to want.  And even 
when  they  were  interested,  they  used  the  press  for  other  func-
tions  than  information;  they  also  wanted  a  performance  that 
would give  the outside  world  an  idealized  picture of  Levittown. 
If an  event reflected  negatively on  the community,  many readers 
preferred  to  have  it hushed  up.  For  example,  when  a  teenage 
fight  broke  out,  many  people  wanted  to read  about it,  but were 
also  sorry it had to appear in print.  Likewise, a  neighbor was  un-
happy  about  a  survey  of  Levittown's  racial  attitudes  which  ap-
peared  in  the  Philadelphia  papers  because  she  did  not want  the 
world  to  know  that  many  Levittowners  had  doubts  about  inte-
gration.  Organizational  leade~s are  even  more  insistent  than  or-
dinary residents  that  the  press cover  the performance. Voluntary 
associations  flooded  the  papers  with  publicity releases  written  to 
attract new members and were angered by articles about internal 
strife,  arguing that the papers should be supporting their organi-
zations  instead of  tarnishing their reputations by  playing up dis-
cord.  The demand  for  performance  reporting  even  extended  to' 
noncontroversial  mat·ters.  When  a  photographer  came  to  do  a 
picture  story  on  everyday  activities  in  the  local  pools,  a  school 

Political  Communication 

official  posed  the children in a well-organized swimming and div-
ing  exhibition,  belying  the  near-anarchic  playing  and  splashing 
that normally occurred in a crowded pool too small for much real 
swimming.  Organizational  leaders  and  amateur  politicians  felt 
more compelled to ask  for friendly coverage and were more upset 
by critical reporting than  the  professionals,  who  knew  that  pres-
suring  newsmen  for  printed  praise  would  be  likely  to  boom-
erang. 

The  net  outcome  of  the  reporting  process  is  that  the  public 
does  not get the  kind of news  it would need  if it decided  to  par-
ticipate in government and politics.  Only when an issue  of  wide-
spread concern develops and people  begin  to participate can  the 
reporter spend  the  time  and  energy  to  improve  his  coverage  in 
both  quantity and  quality.  Even  though  he  responds  to,  rather 
than  initiates,  reader  interest,  such coverage  can  have  significant 
impact, providing the already interested with information to par-
ticipate  effectively  and  perhaps  motivating  others  to  join  them. 
When citizen protest becomes sizeable, he can go beyond the gov-
ernmental  performance,  reporting  counterperformances  and 
other  signs  of  the  public's  concern.  He  can  critically  analyze 
official  reports and public statements for  errors or contradictions, 
thus  exposing  the  performance  if  only  by  implication.  He  can 
also  do  surveys  within  the  community  to  reveal  the  extent  of 
citizen  dissatisfaction.  But  even  when  the  reporter's  sympathies 
are with the citizens, he can help them only up to a  point, for  his 
permanent ties  are  w~th his city hall  sources.  When  the  issue  has 
been  resolved  or  public  interest  has  waned,  he  must  face  the 
decision-makers  again,  and  alone.  If the  public  were  interested 
more  often,  he  would  have  more  power  within  the  system  of 
mutual  obligation,  and  the  decision-makers  would  treat  him 
more  respectfully  even  if  he  publicized  the  actual  government. 
This happens to few reporters in few  communities.24 

When reportage diverges  regularly  from  actual  events,  people 
in  the  know  become  skeptical  of  press  competence  and  honesty, 
and  when  the  divergences  become  sizeable,  an  information  vac-
uum develops which  not only  increases skepticism  but generates 
rumors to fill  the vacuum.  It also  encourages  informal communi-
cation systems,  like the community grapevine that serves the resi-
dents,  and  private ones developed  by  decision-makers  to  keep  in 
touch with events outside their own circles.  For instance, a young 
lawyer-politician  developed  an  extensive  personal  information 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

network  by  exchanging  free  legal  advice  to  public  officials  and 
organizations  for  information  he  needed  to  function  politically. 
The reporter's skepticism about the divergence between events 
and  his  coverage  is  even  greater.  The conflict  between his desire 
to write about  the  actual  government and  the  need  to  stress  the 
performance leads  to a  low  opinion of his  sources,  whom  he sees 
as  vain  and  dishonest,  and  of  his  readers,  whom  he  sees  as 
headline-scanners and cranks.  Popular fiction  often describes  the 
reporter as a cynic, and the stereotype has some validity, although 
more often he just becomes discouraged and angTy.  The hostility 
and frustration  he feels  every day  is  expressed openly once a  year 
at press  banquets,  where  reporters  perform skits  which  tell  with 
only  thinly  veiled  animosity  what  they  think  of  the  politicians 
and  the  politics  they cover.  The mutual system  of obligation re-
quires  the  politicians  to  attend  the  banquets  and  to  suffer  the 
attacks in good humor. Once a year, then,  the newspaperman gets 
even with his sources.

5·  This has some  positive functions.  For one thing, it spurs  the party 
workers on  to greater effort  to  defeat  the opposition. For another, 
it  allows  the  professional  politicians  to  test  issues  to  be  used  in 
the campaign on  the workers before  taking  them into the general 
community. 

6.  The  concept  of  performance,  and  of  other  dramatic  terms  used 
in  this analysis,  are  taken from  Goffman,  especially  Chap.  1.  I  use 
the  term  "performance"  somewhat  more  narrowly,  for  he  defines 
it  as  "all  the  activity  of  a  given  participant  on  a  given  occasion 
which serves to influence in any way any of the other participants" 
(p.  15), whereas I  am  thinking primarily of the attempt to impress 
an  audience  that  decisions  are  made  in  ways  other  than  they 
really  are  made.

My first  perception of the performance took place at a  township 
meeting  in  which  I  watched  two  lawyers  debating  angrily  with 
each  other over  a  decision,  only  to  greet  each  other  in  the  most 
friendly fashion after the meeting was over. I  am not sure whether 
they "really meant" the anger, but the point is that they impressed 
the  audience  with  the  intense  defense  of  their  views.  Of  course, 
the  change  in  behavior  can  also  be  described  as  a  shift  in  role 
from  political  antagonists  to  professional  colleagues,  just  as  the 
difference  in  performing and  actual  behavior among government 
officials  can  be  described  as  the  differenr.e  between  the  roles  of 
elected  official  and  decision-maker.  Both  concepts  are  valid,  but 
performance is more useful for understanding the relationship be-
tween government and citizen.

tion  the  incident.  The secretary  explained  she  omitted  it so  that 
"when  people  fifty  years  later  read  this,  they  won't  laugh  at us." 
10.  Top  leaders  admit  that  they  use  ghost-writers  to  write  their 
speeches,  but always qualify the admission  by indicating that they 
go  over  the  final  drafts  themselves.  They may  not  actually do  so, 
but  this  maintains  the  performance  that  the  speech  is  their  per-
sonal  product.

12.  The leader who wants to rise  in  the party must carry his own dis-
trict,  and  there,  with  the  margin  of  victory  being  even  smaller, 
every favor counts. 

13.  One aspiring candidate was  rejected  because  he had gone  to  Har-
vard  Law  School,  and  in  one  school  board  election  I  analyzed, 
candidates with high school diplomas fared better than those who 
had  gone  to  college. 

14.  When  the  Good  Government  slate  offered  to  serve  without  pay, 
the  voters  concluded  that it was  made  up of high-income  people 
who did not need  the  small salaries  attached  to public office,  and 
so  were unlikely  to share  their financial  worries. 

15.  As  a  result,  upper middle class  Levittowners were continually up-
set about the lack of "qualifications" among the candidates. Look-
ing  for  officeholders  of  their  own  socioeconomic  level,  they  com-
plained  about  the  candidates· low  level  of  education,  absence  of 
professional skills,  poor speaking style,  vagueness on issues,  and of 
course  their  lack  of  interest  in  nonpartisan  good  government, 
long-range  planning,  and  quality  schools.

ferred outsiders  to local  people.

19.  At  the  time  of  my  study,  Levittown  news  was  published  by  a 
county  daily,  the  Levittown  (now  Burlington  County)  Times;  a 
weekly,  the Levittown Herald;  and by  occasional reportage in  the 
Philadelphia,  Camden,  and  Trenton  papers.  In  1961,  a  weekly 
called Levittown  Life was  founded  by  a  resident  and  his  friends. 
It  supported  C.A.P.S.  an-d  generally  spoke  for  the  upper  middle 
class  point  of  view  until  it  went  bankrupt  in  1963.  It was  then 
purchased by a  local Democratic leader and became a  Democratic 
party  organ  to  counteract  the  Times  and  the  Herald,  both  of 
which  were  usually  Republicah.  The  original  founders  of  Levit· 
town Life bought a weekly in a neighboring town of Beverly  from 
which  they  commented  on  events  in  Levittown.  By  1964,  it  too 
went  under.  So  did  Levittown  Life,  which  was  merged  with  the 
Burlington  County  Times.  Later  that  year,  a  suburban chain  be-
gan  to  publish  the  Willingbot·o  Weekly,  retitled  the  Willingboro 
Suburban  in  1966.

23.  Normal  self-censorship  also  takes  place.  Coverage  of  municipal 
court  proceedings  in  Levittown  papers  excluded  domestic  con-
flicts,  because  they  were  considered  private  affairs,  and  sordid 
events were  toned down  for  "family newspapers."  Nervous break· 
downs  which  took  place  in  public  were  reported  as  arguments, 
and  the  case  of  a  man  who  took  his  underage  cousin  to  a  motel 
was  described only as  a  disorderly charge.  The story of a  teacher's 
breakdown in class  was  quashed by  all reporten at the suggestion 
of  the  town's  senior  reporter because  he felt  that both  the  school 
system  and  the  individual  teacher  would  be  hurt  badly,  while 
the newspapers would not gain sufficiently by having published it. 
24.  If it  did  happen,  their  reportorial  performance  would  probably 
be  affected.  Indeed, the only journalists with such political power 
are  columnists  and commentators who do not have  to  gather the 
news  themselves.

PROCESS

JUST  AS  DECISION-MAKERS  CONSTANTLY  SEEK  CERTAINTY  IN  A  PO· 
litical  system  marked  by  uncertainty,  so  they  attempt  to  avoid 
decisions  in  a  governmental  system  which  requires  decisions. 
Government  is  organized  toward  bureaucratic  routine;  it  aims 
to carry out municipal  services entrusted  to it in  such a  way  that 
appointed  officials  will  hold  their posts  and  elected  ones  will  be 
re-elected, and that criticism and conflict are minimized  between 
elections. The ideal is a situation in which precedent can rule and 
no new decisions  are needed. 

But new problems arise  and  decisions  must be made.  Broadly 
speaking,  the  decision-making  process  is  ruled  by  four  criteria. 
First,  government is  normally passive;  it waits  for  issues  to come 
to  its  attention.  In  Levittown,  the  decision-makers  initiated  ac-
tion  only  on  internal governmental  expansion  necessary  for  the 
smooth  functioning  of  the  bureaucratic  apparatus;  on  state  or 
federal  statutory  requirements;  on  issues  which  required  little 
effort, cost, or st.ructural change and resulted in favorable  public-
ity;  on matters which benefitted Levittown as  a whole in the con-
tinuing competition with other communities; and when they had 
no  choice  but  to  act.  For  example,  the  Township  Committee 
initiated a  polio vaccination program without citizens'  asking for 
it,  because  it was  easy  to  do  and  earned  political  goodwill,  and 
the  school  board  raised  school  budgets  because  the  increasing 
number of students left it no other alternative. 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

Second,  government avoids or postpones decisions  that cannot 
be resolved  without conflict or  that  expose  the gap between  the 
actual and  the performing government. The Township Commit-
tee  tried  to  bring  ordinances  out  of  the  caucus  to  the  public 
meeting  only  when  unanimity  had  been  achieved.  Third,  gov-
ernment  gravitates  toward  decisions  with  immediate  payoffs, 
avoiding  those  which  produce  mainly  long-run  effects.  Govern-
ment is  reluctant to establish  new  precedents or  set  into  motion 
irreversible  policies  that may restrict its flexibility  in  the future. 
For  this  reason,  if  no  other,  long-range  planning  and  the  for-
mulation  of  permanent  "policy statements"  are  discouraged.  Of 
course government does plan, but principally for goals of its own 
choosing-for example, the staging of performances and the adap-
tation of decisions to future election campaigns. It also sets policy 
(albeit  unwritten)  when  government  agencies  develop  working 
routines.  But  long-range  plans  that  require  higher  current  ex-
penditures to produce a result 5 or 10 years later (for example, to 
forestall  future  school  overcrowding)  are  only  implemented  if 
outside  funds  are  available  or  if  community  pressures  give  the 
decision-makers  no  other  choice.  By  and  large,  however,  plan-
ning and explicit policies are advocated by voters whose demands 
are  being  ignored  in  current  decisions  and  unwritten  policy, 
their  hope  being  that  these  demands  can  be  included  in  long-
range plans. 

Fourth,  the  decision-making  process  is  structured  so  that, 
whenever  possible,  every  elected  official  is  free-or  feels  he  is 
free-to reach  the decision dictated by his  conscience and  by his 
desire to benefit the community. Whether or not he is  ever really 
free  is  debatable,  but the feeling of being so  allows  him to claim 
that he is  not required to pay attention to citizen  pressure,  to in-
clude his own values  in his decision,  and  to  identify  these as  the 
public interest. Feeling free  to vote "according to his conscience" 
allows him to make decisions that will please his reference groups 
and the constituents from whom he gets the most votes. 

The application  of  these  criteria  resulted  in decisions  which: 
(1)  maintained  Levittown's  governmental  bureaucracy  and  mu-
nicipal  services  up  to  voter  expectation;  (2)  aided  the  party  in 
power;  (3)  benefitted  large  or  otherwise  influential  voter  blocs 
and satisfied  interest groups  that were either  in constant contact 
with/ the  government,  could  apply  pressure  on  it,  or  had  cam-

The  Decision-making  Process 

paign  funds  to  contribute  (or  withhold);  (4)  represented  pet 
projects or vested interests of individual decision-makers. 

Obviously,  the decision-makers used  their decisions to improve 
their own and  their  parties'  election  chances.  Although  citizens' 
requests were few,  they carried out those easily satisfied and those 
from  large  or  visible  voter  blocs.  Demands  from  the  Catholic 
leadership group  always  received  attention  because  the  Catholic 
population was  large, and  the Democrats tried  to  satisfy requests 
from  the  Jewish  community  because  it  was  well  organized  and 
therefore assumed  to be  a  cohesive voter  bloc.1  Unorganized res-
idents were similarly favored  if their demands were modest, con-
sidered desirable by the decision-makers, and not likely to arouse 
opposition from more powerful voters or interest groups. 

But most  decisions,  other  than  housekeeping ones,  were  made 
for  the  interest gToups  closest  to government. At  the time of my 
study,  the  most  demanding  one  was  the  Levitt  organization, 
which  needed  frequent  approval  of  its  building  program  and 
made  demands  and  suggestions  on  a  wide  variety  of  issues.  In 
fact,  the builder was consulted so  often  that for all  practical  pur-
poses  he  was  a  member  of  the  actual  government.  In  addition, 
most decision-makers  accepted  the builder's claim  that what was 
good for him was also good for the township. For example, Levitt 
was  able  to  persuade  the  Utilities Authority not  to link compet-
ing small  shopping  centers  to  the  water  and  sewer  lines  he  had 
built until  he turned the lines over to the township.  In  the early 
years,  the decision-makers  even  checked with  the builder  on de-
cisions  in  which  he  had  no  interest.  Lacking  staff  aid  of  their 
own,  respecting  the  know-how  of  Levitt  executives,  wanting  to 
make sure the firm would not oppose their final  decision, and be-
lieving  that  Levitt  had  the  right  to  be  consulted  on  everything, 
they sought his advice on a wide variety of topics. 

Paying close attention to the builder was also dictated by polit-
ical considerations.  Not only could he exert power at all  levels of 
government,  but many Levittowners were favorably  inclined  to-
ward him, so  that political incentives for opposing him were few. 
Working class residents were grateful  for  the opportunity to buy 
a  suburban  house  they  could  not  hav.e  afforded  otherwise,  and 
middle class  residents,  though  less  grateful,  went along with  his 
demands  as  long  as  they  meant  lower  taxes  or  affected  yet  un-
built neighborhoods.  Only  the  cosmopolitans  opposed  him,  for, 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

being able and willing to look further into the future,  they could 
see  that Levittown could not solve  its  tax problems so  long as  he 
continued  building,  thus  minimizing  their  chance.  to  obtain 
schools and other municipal services that met their upper middle 
class standards. 

The other major  interest group  was  made  up of businessmen 
who  had  bought  land  in  Levittown  and  wanted  to  build  stores 
and shopping centers.  Here,  too,  the  municipal  government was 
generally  eager  to  please.  Wanting  more  taxables  in  the  town-
ship,  it welcomed  the arrival of new businesses-so much so  that 
Planning  Board  meetings  were  sometimes  set  to  accommodate 
the  schedules  of applicants  for  licenses  and  zoning  changes. 

Finally,  the  decision-makers  supported  each  others'  pet  proj-
ects;  protected the vested interests, political domains, and private 
businesses  each  had  staked  out;  and went along with  colleagues' 
personal  grudges. 2  Even  when  beset  by  internal  strife,  the deci-
sion-making  bodies  always  united  to  defend  members  against 
attack from citizens.  For example, school  board members allowed 
a  colleague  to  continue  his  advocacy  of  municipal  recreation 
although the school  system wanted to retain control of recreation 
facilities;  and  the  Township  Committee  did  not  interfere  with 
one  committeeman's  personal  vendetta  against  another  leading 
politician, even though it was politically ruinous. 

Nevertheless,  the model  that best describes decision-making in 
Levittown  is  "political  benefit-cost  accounting,"  for,  generally 
speaking,  the decision-makers tried to evaluate the costs ·and ben-
efits  of any decision  for  their own and  their  party's  political  fu-
ture.8  Of course,  they did not apply such a  model  systematically, 
but  acted  intuitively.  Sometimes  they  had  too  little  informa-
tion about even  the obvious costs  and benefits of their decisions, 
and  rarely  were  they  aware  of  the  subtler  and  long-range  ones. 
Lacking sufficiently detailed  feedback,  they did  not  know  which 
voters  might  be affected  by  a  specific  issue  and  how  they would 
react.  Moreover,  the  personal  values  of  the  decision-makers  and 
their conceptions of the public interest were added to the mix, so 
that  often  decisions  only  approximated  those  suggested  by  the 
model. 

The Responsiveness of the  Decision-making Process 

Although  Levittown's  public  decisions  were  made  by  a  hand-
ful  of  elected  officials,  responding  principally  to  demands  and 

The  Decision-making  Process 

pressures  from  a  small  number  of  Citizens  and  interest  groups, 
many decisions were remarkably responsive to the rest of the citi-
zenry,  particularly  the  lower  middle  class  majority.'  While  I 
could  not  compare  residents'  attitudes  with  decision-maker  ac-
tions on every decision,  the data I  have support the hypothesis of 
responsiveness.  The  random  sample  was  asked  for  its  views  on 
seven major issues, and in all but two the majority of respondents 
supported  the  governmental  decision.  For example,  89  per cent 
favored  (or  had  no  opinion  on)  the  desirability  of  a  city  man-
ager,  56  per cent were  concerned about rising  taxes,  and  7~ per 
cent went  along  with  changing  the  name  of  the  township  from 
Willingboro  to  Levittown.' On the question  of doctors  purchas-
ing  homes  for  office  use,  ~6 per cent were  in  favor,  15  per cent 
had no opinion,  and 49  per cent were  opposed-suggesting why 
the final decision of government was a compromise that restricted 
two  nonresident  doctors  to  a  house.  Likewise,  an  almost  even 
split between those for,  against, and undecided about racial  inte-
gration suggests why the township government and both political 
parties refused to get involved in the issue.' 

Decisions and citizens' attitudes diverged on liquor, and Levit-
towners'  opposition  to  the  Township Committee's approval  of a 
wet  community  contributed  to  the  incumbent  committeeman's 
defeat  at  the  next  election.7  The reduction  of  the  kindergarten 
entry  age,  which  the  school  board  rejected,  was  favored  by  a 
slight majority, but most had no opinion, and the divergence can 
be attributed to  the school  board's minimal  contact with its con-
stituents  at  the  time  of decision. 8  A  1964  survey of attitudes  on 
school  policy among a  much larger sample showed  that the resi-
dents usually favored  the status quo or had no opinion, thus pro-
ducing  convergence  with  school  board  decisions.•  For  example, 
29  per cent wanted smaller elementary school classes,  18  per cent 
wanted  larger ones,  but 53  per cent  preferred no change or had 
no  opinion.  Likewise,  ~o per  cent  favored  higher  expenditures 
for education;  16 per cent, lower ones;  but 54 per cent wanted no 
change or expressed no opinion. No wonder the school board felt 
it had a mandate for a  policy of minimal change. These data can-
not  prove  decision-makers'  responsiveness,  for  the  surveys  were 
conducted  after  the  decisions  were  made,  did  not  limit  them-
selves  to  voters  actually concerned about  the  issue,  and did  not 
measure the intensity of their concern.  Perhaps the best illustra-
tion  of  the  overall  responsiveness  to  the  majority  is  that  when-

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

ever  the  decision-makers  went  against  majority  opinion,  they 
promptly  lost  the  next  election.  Only  Levitt  usually  received 
what he wanted, but when his demands were opposed by the resi-
dents,  they  voted  out  the  decision-makers  who  went  along  with 
him. 

The  pattern  of responsiveness  can  be  traced  back  to  the  elec-
tion  systern. 10  The  selection  of  candidates  assured  officeholders 
who  were  representative  of  the  large  mass  of  voters,  and  their 
handling  of  issues  reflected  the  vagueness  and  confusion  which 
the voters themselves felt.  Moreover,  both parties agreed substan-
tially on basic  assumptions.  lloth carne out for  low  taxes, a  mini-
mal  role for government, and decisions that would  favor  the  ma-
jority whenever possible;  both opposed the demands and political 
styles  of working class  people and  upper middle class  cosmopoli-
tans.  Of course,  the  fit  between  candidates  and  community  was 
hardly perfect, and most of the  time  Levittowners felt  they were 
choosing  the  lesser of two  evil  ones.  They grumbled about  poli-
tics,  but they were not dissatisfied enough to act and did not sup-
port minority  factions  or independent slates.  After  all,  decision-
makers  rarely  had  significant  impact  on  the  really  important 
aspects  of their lives;  they  could npt solve  the community's  cen-
tral  problem,  taxes,  and  they  were  not  expected  to  solve  the 
financial,  job,  family,  and  child-rearing  problems  of  individual 
Levittowners. 

But if  the  decision-makers were  responsive  when  the  majority 
demanded  it,  they  were  anything  but  responsive  to  other  than 
the  powerful  minorities.  The election's diffuse  and general  feed-
back apprised the politicians of the majority opinions, but it did 
not inform them of minority demands.  Nor were  the  performing 
and  actual  governments  attuned  to  these  demands,  for  the  per-
formance  was  structured  to assure  the majority that all  was  well, 
and the caucus and parties sought decisions that would attract the 
majority  at  the  next  election.  Moreover,  the  decision-makers 
could not represent minorities either. A  Township Committee of 
three  men  (and  later  of  five)  and  even  a  school  board  of  nine 
made it impossible  to elect minority representatives  to  the actual 
government,  and since decision-makers  sought  unanimity before 
passing ordinances,  there was  little room for  the consideration of 
powerless  minority  opinion.  Even  when  decisions  were  reached 
by  majority  vote,  the  decision-making  body  and  the  issue  itself 
had  to  be  structured  so  as  to  create  a  dichotomous  (or  at  best 

The  Decision-making  Process 

trichotomous)  set  of  alternatives:  for,  against,  or  a  compromise 
that would  swing enough  opposition  votes.  As  a  result,  even  the 
school  board usually split into only two factions,  and when more 
existed,  these  had  to  combine  to  affect  a  board  decision.  Conse-
quently,  the  decision-makers  could  deal  responsively  with  issues 
favored  by a  large  mass  of voters or an  influential  minority,  but 
not with those of significance to a number of less  influential ones. 
Since  minorities were  more  frequent  petitioners for  action  than 
the  majority,  the  decision-makers  were  often  unpopular  with 
small  groups of residents,  which only encouraged  them  to  gener-
ate yet  more  support from  the majority and  to  restrict  feedback 
from  minorities  even  further.  In  effect,  then,  the  government 
could not be responsive  to  the pluralism of the community. 

Sometimes the decision-makers did not even have to be respon-
sive,  for  if  they  had  the  power  to  act  and could  not  be  held  re-
sponsible  for  their actions  by  the  voters,  or  if  the  large  mass  of 
voters did not care,  they were  free  to do as  they pleased.  For ex-
ample,  they  could  sometimes  give  business  contracts  to  their 
friends,  rezone unbuilt portions of the community  to benefit the 
builder  or  other  businessmen,  and  draft  ordinances  to  fit  the 
requests of an influential petitioner-and without evoking much 
protest.  Levittown's  government  was  more  representative  than 
most,  for it lacked appointed positions of  great power or "rotten 
borough"  election  districts  which  would  enable  an  individual 
decision-maker to act without concern for  the voters.  Perhaps  the 
main obstacle to responsiveness, whether to majority or minority, 
was  the  decision-makers'  willingness  to  support  their  colleagues' 
individual interests and personal  biases,  for citizen protest had to 
be  sizeable  before  their  group  solidarity  weakened.  Sometimes, 
then,  "willful individuals can block the intentions of whole com-
munities  for  a  long  time,  numerous  routines  develop  around 
local  positions of influence  . . .  and generally a large number of 
vicious  circles  will  protect  and  reinforce  the  local  conserva-
tism." 11 

INTERVENTION  IN  THE  DECISION-MAKING  PROCESS 

The decision-makers' failure to respond to minorities forces  these 
to  intervene  in  the decision-making  process.  By  applying a  vari-
ety  of  pressures,  interveners  seek  to  overcome  the  performance, 
to make  th~ actual government notice them, and then to divert it 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

from  its  customary  responsiveness  to  majority  and  party  de-
mands.  Some  methods  of  intervention  are  more  effective  than 
others, although  the success  of any given method depends on the 
issue  in question and  the  political  situation of the moment.  But 
if a  large  enough group of voters  is  intensely concerned  over an 
issue  just  before  the  election,  almost any method  is  likely  to  be 
effective. 

At other times, success is compounded of the amount of change 
demanded  and· the  political  pressure  that can  be applied.  Every 
change  requires  some  adjustment  in  the  governmental  routine, 
in  the allocation of funds,  staff, and other scarce resources, and in 
the  network  of mutual  obligations  among  decision-makers,  out-
side as  well as  inside the community. Election victories and party 
control  give  the  decision-makers  a  limited  amount  of  political 
capital  to  invest  in  change,  which  they  spend carefully  to  main-
tain and enhance  their  own  positions. 12  The greater  the  change 
demanded by interveners, therefore,  the more pressure  they must 
generate  to force  the decision-makers  to spend  their capital.  Ob-
viously,  the  best  pressure  is  supplied  by  a  host  of  concerned 
voters,  but when an issue  touches only a few  people (as  it usually 
does),  other  methods  must  be  used.  All  these  seek  to  persuade 
the  decision-makers  to  do  the  interveners'  bidding,  and  if  they 
fail,  to create greater public awareness of the issue  in order to ob-
tain enough political support for  another confrontation with the 
decision-makers.  Awareness  is  best  created  by  arousing  contro-
versy,  for  it  may  get  newspaper  headlines  and  will  at  least  em-
barrass  the decision-makers and  threaten  their performance. 

The first  and most  frequent  intervention strategy  is  to  make a 
public statement demanding a  particular decision.  This  is  effec-
tive  in  getting  the  interveners  into  the  political  arena  and  in 
legitimating their existence,  for  the rules of the democratic  per-
formance  require decision-makers  to  take  note  of a  public state-
ment,  even  when made by a  small  ad hoc group of citizens.  Fur-
ther impetus is  added  if  the statement is  picked  up by the  press, 
and particularly if it receives editorial comment, for  the decision-
makers  believe,  rightly  or  not,  that  editorials  would  not  be 
written  if  they  did  not  represent  a  constituency  of  some  kind. 
The public statement can  take various forms.  Most often it is a 
simple  moral  appeal,  sometimes  arguing  that  the  interveners' 
demands are  in  the  public  interest.  Such appeals are likely  to be 
ineffective,  because  the decision-makers know  that the other side 

The  Decision-making  Process 

•  341  • 

can deliver a moral appeal of equal fervor or will  picture itself as 
a  yet  more faithful guardian of the public interest. If the speaker 
is  an  important  community  figure  or  if  he  delivers  a  good  or 
colorful speech,  it may be reported by the press and thus will  ad-
vertise  the  issue;  if he is  glib,  however,  the moral "power" of the 
appeal is reduced further;  and if he is  hired  talent,  his words are 
totally  wasted,  because  the  decision-makers  know  he  is  only  a 
mercenary.  Occasionally,  the  moral  weight  of  the  appeal  itself 
may be enough  to  make  the decision-makers  pay attention  or to 
arouse  public  support  for  the  interveners  among  the  citizens 
(and no one can predict with certainty whether or not the appeal 
will  do  either),  but  in  a  community  like  Levittown,  grosser 
forms  of  injustice  are  rare,  and  the  inequities  that do  occur are 
too  insignificant  to  shock  most  political  consciences,  either 
among politicians  or citizens. 

One of the most widely used moral appeals is  for "leadership," 
addressed  to  the  most  influential  decision-maker  by  the  least 
powerful claimants in  the  hope  that  it will  flatter  or shame  him 
into  action  in  their  behalf.  A  politician  rarely  listens  to  such 
appeals, for they require him to risk his political capital in behalf 
of an  unpopular solution without likelihood of political  reward. 
In effect,  interveners who call  for  leadership are asking  the  poli-
tician  to  take  responsibility for  a  decision  which  the  rest  of  the 
community  may  not  want and  for  which  it may  punish  him  at 
the next election. 

A  more  extreme  version  of  the  moral  appeal  is  the  attack:  a 
charge  that  decision-makers  are  unfair,  in  collusion  against  the 
interveners,  politically  motivated,  or  paid  off.  Attacks  are  gen-
erally  ineffective  because  decision-makers  can  and  usually  will 
mount a  stronger attack on them in return.  If the attacks are un-
justified-as they often are-the decision-makers seek  to discredit 
the interveners--equally unjustifiably-as agitators. The attackers 
may see  moral  violations where none exist,  misconstruing a  rou-
tine  caucus  as  a  conspiracy  and  a  group  of  political  allies  as  a 
clique,  while  the  decision-makers,  believing  themselves  to  vote 
their conscience, misconstrue charges that they are acting for par-
tisan reasons as  rank injustice.  Both sides may be partly accurate, 
of course, but the attackers, unable to see more than a glimpse of 
the  actual  government,  ascribe  overly  devious  motives  to  its 
members,  whereas  the  decision-makers  are  acting  to  maintain  a 
performance of which they mav be unconscious. 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

A  somewhat different  strategy  is  exaggeration,  used  to  predict 
dire  consequences  of  an  unfavorable  decision.13  For  example, 
when  the  Township  Committee  proposed  to  permit  liquor  in 
Levittown,  opponents  were  soon  predicting  a  bar  on  every 
corner,  even  though  the  ordinance  permitted  only  six  in  the 
entire  community  for  the  next  ten  years.  Exaggeration,  too,  is 
only effective if it attracts further support, however. The decision-
makers have some understanding of the consequences of their de-
cisions,  and  can  counter  with  their  own  exaggerations.  Another 
form  of  this  strategy  is  to exaggerate  the  public support  behind 
the interveners,  by  presenting petitions  or  "stacking"  a  meeting 
with  friends  and neighbors who participate to be helpful, rather 
than  because of their  interest.  If the decision-makers  know  their 
community,  this  technique  is  not  very compelling,  unless  it  en-
rolls  support from  like-minded  but reticent  people who wait for 
a  bandwagon to develop before they will voice  their support. 

If appeals  or attacks  fail,  the  interveners can resort  to  a  coun-
terperformance,  usually  asking  the  government  questions  (to 
which  both  sides  already  know  the  answer)  at  the  public  meet-
ing.  Since  the performing government cannot shut off questions, 
the decision-makers will try to prevent repetitions of the counter-
performance by inviting the participants backstage. For example, 
when  C.A.P.S.  began  to lobby for "better" schools  by asking the 
school board questions about plans for curriculum improvement, 
its  leaders  were  invited  to meet  privately with  the  board  to  dis-
cuss  their  proposals. 14  The decision-makers  may  try  to  persuade 
the interveners that they have made  their point and that further 
counterperformances are superfluous, or they may ask for sympa-
thy  by describing other  pressures  that  prevent  them  from  meet-
ing  the  interveners'  demands.  All  of  these  techniques  are  essen-
tially  attempts  to  coopt  them  into  cooperating  with  the  actual 
government.  If they do  not  work,  and  the counterperformances 
attract public attention, the decision-makers may propose a  com-
promise. 

The effectiveness of the counterperformance is  limited, for  too 
much  repetition  of  questions  and  claims  can  antagonize  the 
decision-makers and the public. Eventually, then,  the interveners 
have  to gather further support and  provide concrete evidence of 
its  existence.  Since  attendance  at  public  meetings  is  m,inimal,  a 
small but repeated turnout of concerned people is quite effective. 
The school board almost gave in on the issue of the kindergarten 

The  Decision-making  Process 

entrance  age  because  the  advocates  were  consistently  able  to 
bring  2o-3o  people  with  them.  The  decision-makers  will,  of 
course,  try  to  find  out  whether  those  who  attend  are  serious  or 
whether they  have come only as  a  favor  to a  friend  or neighbor. 
Petitions also  involve large numbers of people in the interven-
tion process,  but the decision-makers know that many people sign 
them  only  to  please  the  circulators  or  to  get  them  out  of  the 
house.  Unless the signers come to a  public meeting,  it is  assumed 
that  the  signatures  themselves  do  not  indicate  serious  interest. 
For  example,  when  the  opponents  of  nonresident  physicians 
presented a  petition with over 400 names,  the nonresident physi-
cians  brought  in  1200.  Their  use  of  a  commercial  signature-
collecting agency  neutralized  their numerical  superiority and in 
the  end  the  Township  Committee  ignored  the  petitions  alto-
gether  and  effected  a  compromise  between  the  two  points  of 
view. 

For interveners  who  are  small  in  number,  low  in power,  and 
unable to generate widespread public support,  the most effective 
method  is  probably  to  insert  new  "facts"  or  "ideas"  into  the 
decision-making  process.  By  facts  and  ideas,  decision-makers 
mean three things primarily:  political or other consequences of a 
decision,  viewpoints  of  groups  not  previously  considered,  and 
suggestions  for  compromise.  Of course,  intervention  appeals  are 
always  filled  with  facts  and  ideas,  and  most  of  the  time,  the 
decision-makers  have  heard  them all  or are  not interested.  They 
are  not  impressed  by  unprovable  consequences  or  long-range 
ones;  even when they ask  for  new facts,  they may reject those not 
to  their  liking,  as  they  did  when  the  kindergarten  interveners 
supplied  scientific  findings  which  disproved  their  beliefs.  Of 
course, asking for  new information is also one way of postponing 
a  decision;  often  decision-makers  (and  interveners)  call  for  a 
study to  obtain  time  for  enrolling further support for  their  own 
position.  If the  decision  has  not  yet  been  made,  the  decision-
makers may be receptive to new data, but their receptivity varies 
with  the  situation.  If a  compromise  is  called  for,  they  may  be 
eager for  solutions;  otherwise,  they usually  pay attention only to 
new information about important political  or community impli-
cations of alternative decisions. 

In  the  last  analysis,  the  most  effective  method  of  intervention 
is  the  demonstration  of  visible  political  support.  In  Levittown, 
what impressed decision-makers most was a  sizeable and repeated 

•  344  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

turnout  of  personally  concerned  citizens.  For  example,  if  the 
issue dealt with education, they had to be parents whose children 
would  be  affected;  if  it  concerned  a  zoning change,  they  had  to 
live  in  the  area  under  discussion.  The  larger  the  turnout  the 
better, of course,  but no absolute number can  be  predicated,  for 
the  figure  varies  with  tbe  amount of change  being demanded.u 
For example, a  half-dozen complaints about the bus service  from 
Levittown to Philadelphia were  sufficient  to persuade the Town-
ship  Committee  to  ask  the  bus company for  additional  buses.  A 
group  of  four  residents  was  enough  to  have  six  small  neighbor-
hood shopping areas which had been proposed in the master phn 
eliminated through a zoning ordinance revision. They called and 
wrote  to  the  builder,  the  Township  Committee,  the  township 
building inspector, and the Governor, and they submitted a  peti-
tion  signed  by  all  residents  adjacent  to  the  proposed  sites.  Al-
though  they  exaggerated  their actual  support, Levitt's reluctance 
to  displease  people  who  had  already  purchased  homes  and  his 
lack of enthusiasm about the proliferation of neighborhood shop-
ping  areas  suggested  by  the  township's  planning  consultant  re-
sulted  in  successful  intervention.  In  this  instance,  then,  deter-
mined activity  by a  concerned  handful  which  accorded  with  the 
preferences of the agencies making the change was  sufficient. 

Conversely,  almost  400  petition signatures  and  20  to  30  inter-
veners  who  attended  school  board  meetings  regularly  were  not 
enough to alter the kindergarten entry age,  because  it required a 
change  in  attitude  on  the  part  of  school  board  members  and, 
more  important,  a  change  in  established  school  board  policy 
which  contradicted  the  policies  of  other  boards  in  Burlington 
County  and  the  recommendations  of  the  State  Department  of 
Education. On the other hand,  150 angry Levittowners at a  pub-
lic  hearing  effected  a  compromise  on  the  nonresident  doctor 
issue,  but  a  slightly  smaller  number  could  not  convince  the 
Township Committee to keep Levittown dry.  In the doctor issue, 
a  compromise  did  not  require  thwarting  the  builder;  in  the 
liquor  issue,  no  compromise  was  possible,  and  evidently  the  in-
terveners were  not numerous enough  to convince  the  Township 
Committee  to  cross  the  builder.  Six  hundred  even  angrier  citi-
zens  who  attended  the  1961  school-budget  public  hearing  were 
unaJ:>le  to  force  a  further  reduction  in  the  budget  because  this 
would have  required  the school  board  to  increase  class  size,  thus 
alienating teachers and  the  State Department of Education. 

Only an intensive study of many issues would make it possible 

The  Decision-making  Process 

•  345  • 

to determine accurately  the numbers needed for successful  inter-
vention.  Levittown  experience  shows  that  a  small  number  can 
sometimes  achieve  its  aim,  but  that  in  order  to  reverse  a  major 
government decision, concerted intervention from at least 5 to  15 
per  cent  of  the  com1p.unity,  (above  and  beyond  constant  inter· 
veners,  clearly  identifiable minority voters,  and opposition  party 
members)  is  necessary,  and  probably  a  larger  proportion  for 
more  permanent  policy change.  These figures  suggest  that  inter-
vention can be effective and can even  overcome the wishes  of the 
majority on some  issues.  If interveners demand  significant  struc-
tural  change  in  government,  however,  they  must  have  support 
from at least a  majority of the population or more,  because such 
change  has  repercussions  on  outside  governments  and  political 
systems,  which will  exert  pressure  on  local  politicians  to  prevent 
alterations in the  status quo. 

What Levittown experience cannot show  is  the effectiveness of 
intervention methods such as demonstrations, protest marches, sit-
ins,  and riots.  Middle class suburbanites are unlikely  to use such 
methods,  but  if  these  became  necessary,  they  would  perhaps  be 
met  first  with  frenzied  performances  to  maintain  equilibrium, 
and  then  with repression,  after which  the decision-makers would 
slowly  begin  to make concessions  in  the most face-saving manner 
possible,  provided, of course  that such  concessions did not gener-
ate a  yet larger group of people opposed  to  them.  If they do,  the 
decision-makers  are caught in the middle  and  may resort  to  per-
formance solutions which  try to persuade the interveners that gov-
ernment is  on  their side,  and convince  the opposition  that it will 
not make basic changes.  Local  government's  power to change so-
ciety is  limited, and intervention for  this purpose ought to be di-
rected  against  the  federal  government  and  the  corporate  econ-
omy.  The  former  will  only  be  impressed  by  an  intervening 
group  of  massive  proportions,  however,  and  the  latter  does  not 
need to be responsive  to  interveners at all  unless they can mount 
a sizeable work stoppage or consumer boycott.  Local  intervention 
can only hope to affect  the national bodies if it takes place in sev-
eral  communities  at  once,  and  cannot  be  explained  away  as  an 
effect of distinctively  local  political  or economic conditions. 

TYPES  OF INTERVENERS 

Most  of the groups  who  sought  to  intervene  in  Levittown  were 
ad  hoc.  Indeed,  permanent  ones  tended  to  become  interest 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

groups  which  were  consulted  before  a  decision  relevant  to  their 
concerns  was  reached.  One  permanent  though  unorganized 
group  was  not  consulted  regularly,  however,  and  became  a  con-
sistent and active intervener-the cosmopolitans. 

The Cosmopolitans 

The cosmopolitans are colleg€-educated and are usually profes-
sionals  with  upper  middle _class  life  styles.  Although  they  are 
quite  active  locally,  their  appro<~ch  to  the  community  is  extra-
local;  they seek to realize an ideal community which stems from a 
nationwide  and  even  worldwide  culture. 16  The  ideal  places  a 
high  value  on  education.  Cosmopolitans  want  a  high-quality 
school  system  to  prepare youngsters  for  the  best  universities and 
professional  careers,  as  well  as  facilities  for adult education,  edu-
cational  kinds  of  recreation,  and  high  culture.  Government and 
politics, they feel,  should be liberal and reform, with emphasis on 
progressive  public  welfare,  medical  and  mental  health  services, 
decision-making  by  experts and  technicians  rather  than  by  poli-
ticians, a  nonpartisan political structure that follows  the norms of 
democratic  theory,  long-range  and master  planning,  and  a  maxi-
mum of  intense and selfless  citizen  participation.  Their commu-
nity  should  be  governed  by  liberal-professional  upper  middle 
class values. 

Cosmopolitans can  be found in every community, but  they are 
particularly  visible  in  new communities and  in  those  where  the 
majority is of lower income and status.U There, the cosmopolitan 
"set"  is  small  and  scattered  and  the  mutual  antagonism  that  de-
velops  in  relationships  with  lower-status  neighbors  soon  forces 
them  to  find  friends  outside  the  block and  to set  up community· 
wide  organizations  that  express  their  values.  Since  they  enjoy 
civic  participation and  are  often  highly  skilled  in fact-gathering 
and  political  advocacy,  they  frequently  become  active  in  the 
community and  in  its  government  long  before  other  groups do. 
For  example,  in  Park  Forest,  Illinois,  they  pressed  for  the  in-
corporation of the new community as a  village,  organized  its first 
government,  and  stayed  in  power  for  several  years,  even  though 
the  community  had  meanwhile  become  predominantly  lower 
middle class. 18 

In  Levittown,  the  prior  existence  of  governing  bodies  forced 
the  cosmopolitans  to  become  interveners  from  the  start.  Al-
though  their  main  concern  has  been  with  education,  they  have 

The  Decision-making  Process 

•  347  • 

also  been active  in  recreation,  planning, racial  integration, men-
tal  health,  "the  juvenile  problem,"  and  social  welfare. 19  They 
established  or helped  to  establish  the  League of Women Voters, 
the  Citizens  Association  for  Public  Schools,  the  Burlington 
Comity  Human  Relations  Council,  and  a  Good  Government 
slate  that ran  unsuccessfully  in  the  1961  election.  They ran  indi-
vidual candidates for Township Committee and the Board of Ed-
ucation  and  tried  to  influence  the  activities  of  many  other 
groups. 

Considering  their  numerical  strength,  their  ability  to  inter-
vene  was  surprising.  There were  probably not more than a  hun-
dred  cosmopolitans  in  Levittown  during  the  time  of  my  study, 
and less  than a  third of these were active  interveners.20  Although 
their demands were  usually rejected,  they were able  to negotiate 
some  successful  compromises.  For  example,  a  handful  of  cosmo-
politans  eventually obtained a  settlement from  the  school  board 
by which children who passed entrance tests could be admitted to 
the  kindergarten  before  the  age  of  five.  They  persuaded  the 
school  system  to raise its academic standards somewhat and to de-
velop  formal  policies  for  its operations.  In  xg61,  two  cosmopoli-
tans ran for  the school board and temporarily dominated the ma-
jority faction,  but they  never  persuaded  either  the  board  or  the 
staff  to  endorse  their  ideas  for  upper middle  class  education.  In 
township affairs  the cosmopolitans  were  less  successful;  although 
they  frequently  appeared  as  critics  of  the  Township Committee 
and  the  Planning Board,  they lacked  the  party  ties  and  political 
strength  needed  to  force  the  decision-makers  into  compromises. 
The cosmopolitans were most successful  when  they were  in ac-
cord with the rest of the community and functioned as  technicans 
and  experts  in  behalf of majority demands  or as  initiators of ac-
tions  that  the  majority  would  eventually  support. For  example, 
an active cosmopolitan sat  on  the  Government Study  group  that 
recommended the city manager form of government, and its  final 
report  was  based  largely  on  his  recommendations.  Another  lob-
bied  almost  singlehandedly  in  Trenton  to  reduce  residence  re-
quirements  for  school  board  members  from  three  years  to  two. 
The  same  two  people  initiated  the  campaign  that  changed  the 
township's  name  back  to  Willingboro  and  spearheaded  the  suc-
cessful  attack  on  the  Township  Committee  to  revoke  an  ordi-
nance  permitting  garden  apartments  in  Levittown.  Thev  also 
tried  to fight  Levitt's plan for  the routing of a  new state  highway 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

through  the  community,  and  even  sought  to  call  a  halt  to  his 
building program  until  tax receipts  could catch  up with  the ex-
panded  municipal  services  they  deemed  desirable,  but  on  these 
issues they could not generate community support. 

The cosmopolitans were skilled  interveners because they had a 
strong and continuing interest in a  number of important issues, 
were  well  equipped to argue  their case,  could propose  new  facts 
and ideas to the decision-makers, and were able to enroll support 
from  like-minded Levittowners.  But their persistence,  their abil-
ity to debate, and their reluctance to give in also created antagon-
ism that sometimes reduced their effectiveness. For one thing, the 
cosmopolitans  seemed  to  be involved  in  everything.  Their con· 
stant  and  dedicated  activism  confounded  the  decision-makers, 
who expected citizens  to participate only sporadically.  And since 
most of the cosmopolitan activity was generated by a  few  people, 
they  were  highly  visible.  When conflict  arose  and  tempers grew 
heated, it was  easy  to think of them as  malcontents and agitators. 
Their  style  of  intervention  added  to  the  antagonism.  They 
considered  themselves  idealists,  defending  the  public  interest of 
the  community  against  selfish  forces.  Like  everyone  else,  they 
assumed  that  their  values  were  the  only  desirable  ones;  they 
could  not see  that  what  they considered  the  public  interest was 
often  only  an  impersonal,  but  nevertheless  upper  middle  class 
(and therefore  self-)  interest. But as  idealists,  they felt  themselves 
also  to  be  morally  and  otherwise  superior,  and  as  well-educated 
people  they  believed  the  opposition  (and  the  decision-makers) 
were  acting  out  of  ignorance-and  this  attitude  upset  everyone 
with  whom  they  disagreed.  Yet  for  all  their  education,  the  cos-
mopolitans  were  as  ethnocentric  as  other  Levittowners;  the  re-
pugnance they felt toward their neighbors' way of life was at least 
as  strong as  the  neighbors'  for  cosmopolitan culture. 

Their  consistent  appeal  to  idealism,  principle,  and  morality 
typed  their opponents as  expedient,  unprincipled, and immoral, 
and  naturally  produced  considerable  hostility  from  them.  And 
since  they  argued  from  principle  they  confused  the  decision-
makers,  who  were  looking  for  more  personal  forms  of  self-
interest.  For example,  they argued for  long-range  planning even 
when they expected  to leave Levittown in a few  years.  Nor could 
the  decision-makers  bargain  with  them;  the  cosmopolitans  saw 
their  priorities  as  absolute  values,  rejecting  all  others  and  pre-
cluding compromise. While this was good strategy for a  counter-

The  Decision-making  Process 

performance,  it  was  hardly  an  effective  method  of  intervention 
for a politically weak minority. As  idealists, the cosmopolitans did 
not  think  in  strategic  terms,  however;  they  stuck  by  their  prin-
ciples and almost welcomed  the resulting antagonism as  a valida-
tion of their own goals. 21 

Part  of  the  conflict  must  be  ascribed  to  cultural  differences. 
The cosmopolitans were  of  higher socioeconomic  level  than  the 
decision-makers, and they communicated this without ever saying 
so.  They did  not defer  to  them as  people or as  officeholders,  but 
confronted  them  as  equals  or  betters.  They could  not  be  intim-
idated  by  power  and  were  sometimes  accused  of lacking  respect 
for  authority.  Their  inability  or  unwillingness  to  realize  that 
they  had no  power  made  their demands seem  even  more  imper-
tinent,  and  their tone grated  on  the decision-makers,  who  retal-
iated  by flexing  their  political  muscles  in  public confrontations. 
The  decision-makers  argued  that  Levittown  was  not  Brookline, 
and  privately  they  muttered  that  these  people  should  not  have 
bought  homes  in  Levittown  in  the  first  place.  Their  hostility 
built up over  the years,  and  eventually resulted  in  a  smear cam-
paign  against  one  of  the  leading  cosmopolitans  which  almost 
forced  her out of public office  and  led  to  her defeat  at  the  next 
election. 

Even  so,  the cosmopolitans could not  be  dismissed  altogether, 
even  by  the  decision-makers.  If they  insisted  on  trying  to  have 
their own goals adopted for public policy much of the  time,  they 
were also calling attention to crucial community problems which 
the  elected  officials,  responding  to  the  voters'  demands  for  opti-
mism, did not want to discuss. For example, when  the cosmopoli-
tans  advocated  higher  school  budgets and  long-range  planning, 
they were not only proposing an upper middle class set of munic-
ipal services,  but were also  pointing to the need  to do something 
about the inadequate  tax base;  and when  they criticized Levitt's 
power,  they  were  raising  questions  that  also  bothered  the  deci-
sion-makers. As  a result,  they were sometimes consulted privately 
by the same  officials  who rejected  their  intervention  in  public.22 
The  cosmopolitans'  overall  effectiveness  as  interveners  is  not 
easy  to evaluate. On the one hand, the hostility they created test-
ifies to their ability to raise  issues and plant seeds of doubt in the 
decision-makers'  minds.  On  the  other  hand,  they  might  have 
been  more  successful  had  some  of  the  cultural  differences  that 
aroused  hostility,  but  were  tangential  to  the  issues,  been  mini-

•  350  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

mized.  I£  the  cosmopolitans  had  been  more  relativistic,  distin-
guishing between demands which reflected only their upper mid-
dle  class  values  and  those  which  were  shared  by  lower  middle 
class  Levittowners,  they  might  have  been  able  to establish coali-
tions  with  the  latter.  Had  they  been  more  sensitive  to  the  way 
they  threatened  the  decision-makers,  they  might  have  let  others 
do  the public  intervening on issues  not limited to upper middle 
class demands.  And if they had been less certain of the universal-
ity  of  their  principles,  they  might  have  implemented  more  of 
their  ideas  through  compromise,  although  they  might  also  have 
been  coopted  or  dismissed  entirely  because  of  the  smallness  of 
their  numbers. 

Yet  the very "idealism" and intractability which brought forth 
so  much  hostility  also  generated  the  motive  power,  the  dedica-
tion, and the persistence with which  they intervened. I£ they had 
been less  convinced of the myth that they alone were fighting for 
Levittown's salvation,  they might not have been able to continue 
the battle. Asking them to be relativistic and realistic might have 
dampened their spirits and caused them to give up when the odds 
were  against  them.  Moreover,  in  order  to  generate  public  sup-
port,  some  people  have  to  take  purely moral  stands,  although  if 
they are  to  be  effective  interveners,  others  on  their  side  have  to 
act  strategically,  to  incorporate  the  moral  stand  into  the  inter-
vention  process.  "Radicals"  who  put  moral  pressure  on  the  Es-
tablishment are consequently as  necessary  as  "coalitionists" who 
work for change within "the system." The cosmopolitans were too 
few  in  number  to  take  both  moral  and  strategic  roles,  and  be-
sides,  if they had taken the latter, they might have been punished 
for  selling out by moral  advocates  in  their group.  Principled  in-
tegrity was  one  of  the  cosmopolitans'  strongest  weapons,  and  if 
they  failed,  the  fault  lay  also  with  other  political  minorities  in 
Levittown who did not know how  to  use  their help in  battles of 
community-wide  significance.  But the  class  differences  were  just 
too great to be hurdled even for  political advantage. 

The Individual  liB Intervener:  The  Role of the Expert 

American  democratic  theory  is  staunchly  individualistic;  it 
asserts  that  the  lone  political  leader,  aided  only  by  the  deus  ex 
machina called  "leadership," can  divert government from  its ac-
customed path, and that the individual citizen can intervene suc-
cessfully  in  the affairs  of government provided he  is  determined

enough and has right on his side. Levittowners, sharing this faith 
wholeheartedly,  were  disappointed  when  leaders  did  not  lead, 
and  disturbed  when  decision-makers  did  not  do  their  bidding. 
They could  not  see  that  a  governmental  change  affecting  many 
thousands of people will  not be undertaken just because an indi-
vidual desires it, and they failed  to realize  that politics is a group 
game  which  pays  little  attention  to  an  individual  intervener. 
When  the  community  is  new,  however,  and  political  organiza-
tions and communication systems are still fledglings,  the individ-
ual may have a chance. For example, Levittown's Superintendent 
of Schools could institute a comprehensive reading program virtu-
ally by fiat,  and William  Levitt was  similarly able  to decide  that 
house  types  should  be  mixed  on  the  streets  of  his  new  commu-
nity.  Even  so,  both  men  had  to  check  out  their  decision  with 
others.  Levitt's executives argued strenuously  that  mixing house 
types  would hurt sales,  and  if  they could  have  proved  their case, 
)..evitt might have  had to agree.  Althoug-h  he owned the firm,  he 
could not insist on change that might alienate his staff.  Once the 
community is  established, few  individuals can "buck the system." 
Even a  politician who campaigns on a single issue and wins office 
in  a  landslide  can  only  implement  his  mandate  if  he  has  the 
authority and the power to force change on the bureaucracy-and 
with  the  electorate  behind  him,  he  is  hardly  acting  as  an  indi-
vidual.23  The lone  intervener  is  only deceiving  himself if he  ex-
pects to change his community all by himself. 

Perhaps  the most effective  individual  intervener is  the expert. 
If he comes from outside the community, he is  thought to be free 
of  political  entangl<:ments  and  can  use  his  technical  skills  and 
professional  reputation  to  urge  change.  Experts  are  normally 
hired for purposes other than intervention, but in a  middle class 
community,  they  are  brought  in  as  interveners  as  well,  because 
middle class citizens believe that facts and expertise can overcome 
politics.24  Working class  people are more  skeptical,  and  also  dis-
trust  the expert, sensing rightly  that his  expertise  usually results 
in recommendations  that favor  the  middle class.25  Yet  even  mid-
dle class  people will  reject  the  expert when  his  solutions do not 
agree  with  their goals.  When  he  is  called  in  to  solve  a  so-called 
technical problem-for example, to advise on the number of Sun-
day school classrooms needed by a church-his intervention is ac-
cepted,  not  only  because  he  has  the  technical  answers,  but  be-
cause  of  consensus  on  the  desirability' of  maximum  religious

education. When the Library Association called on the county li-
brarian's expertise  to  help  plan a  local  library,  however,  her ad-
vice was  ignored when it became evident that the library she  had 
in mind was  much bigger and more costly than that her sponsors 
envisaged. 

Most experts are professionally committed to  the activities and 
institutions about which  they possess  expertise;  they recommend 
the  best  and  most  expensive  programs,  defending  these  with 
technical data and "standards" (for example, those requiring one 
acre  of  playground  for  every  Soo  residents)  which  are  made  up 
by associations composed of fellow professionals. I£ an  expert up-
holds these  standards as  inviolable and  proposes decisions  which 
the  community  is  unwilling  to  adopt,  opposition  is  sure  to  de-
velop.  At  first,  the  attacks  are  likely  to  be  apolitical;  in  Levit-
town,  they  questioned  the  expert's  mystique,  arguing  that  "he 
cannot  be  controlled"  or  "he  is  too  egocentric."  If the  expert 
admits  that the  standards are  too  high and  bargains  for  the  best 
compromise,  he  begins  to  play  a  political  role,  leaving  himself 
open to charges of political interest. He often avoids  this position 
by defending the standards but suggesting that their full  achieve-
ment take place gradually. Even so,  he may not be able to escape 
political  entanglement.  If there  is  opposition  to  his  sponsors  or 
his  ideas,  the  other  side  will  find  experts  with  different  recom-
mendations. When the kindergarten issue was  being debated, the 
interveners collected expert advice  favoring  early entry,  but  the 
school  board  came  back  with  other  experts  who  proved  it  was 
harmful.  Later,  when  C.A.P.S.  proposed  a  consultant  who  had 
served  the  Brookline  schools,  the  board  argued  that  Levittown 
needed experts accustomed  to advising less  affluent communities. 
Experts  of  unquestioned  national  repute  can  sometimes  make 
recommendations stick  merely on  the  basis of  their reputations, 
but  such  men  are  not  likely  to  be  consulted  by  small  commu-
nities. If their fame  is  limited to cosmopolitan circles,  lower mid-
dle  class  people  may  not  be  impressed  at all.  When  Levittown's 
Human  Relations  Council  brought  in  a  group  of  nationally 
known  race  relations experts  to speak  to a  workshop on integra-
tion,  some  attending  Levittowners  dismissed  their  remarks  as 
those of unknown  outsiders brought in to convert them to  toler-
ance. 

Expertise alone is  thus rarely sufficient for  successful  interven-
tion,  because  even  its  detached  and scientific  aura  is  not strong 

The  Decision-making  Process 

enough  to  overcome  political  considerations.  The  expert  has 
more  power  than  the  resident  intervener,  but  his  "intervention 
potential" is  translated  into effective intervention only when  po-
litical support is generated behind his advice. Without it,  the ex-
pert  can  do  little  to  change  the  decisions  of  the  actual  govern-
ment. 

DECISION-MAKING,  INTERVENTION, 
AND  THE  POWER  STRUCTURE 

The  ongoing  decision-making  process  in  a  local  community  is 
best described as  a dialectic,  in which  the decision-makers seek  to 
maintain  the  actual  government  in  equilibrium,  and  the  inter-
veners,  to  upset  it. 26  The  aims  of equilibrium  are  the  preserva-
tion  of order and  the  retention  of  power;  those  of intervention, 
to  disturb  the  actual  government  (and  its  associated  perform-
ances)  sufficiently to force the decision-makers to restore order  by 
acceding  to  intervener demands.  In  this  process,  interveners  are 
aided  by  the  opposition  party,  which  shares  their strategic  aims 
but not  their substantive  demands.  It tries  to  upset  the  equilib-
rium by finding weak spots in the performance that will enable it 
to demonstrate the incumbents' ineffectiveness or dishonesty, and 
by  giving  political  aid  to  interest  groups  whose  demands  or 
power  are  threatened  by  the  decision-makers.  The  opposition 
constantly challenges  the incumbents in symbolic ways,  accusing 
them of partisanship or neglect of the  public interest in the hope 
that  it  will  evoke  political  support.  Interest  groups  and  voter 
blocs  may play  the same game,  testing the decision-makers  to de-
termine  whether  their  power  is  still  being  recognized.  For  ex-
ample,  when  community  ceremonies  were  scheduled  in  Levit-
town,  civic  groups  and  service  clubs  scrambled  for  prominent 
places  in  the  program  to  demonstrate  their  power  in  much  the 
same way as  Soviet officials do when they line up to greet visiting 
heads of state at a  Kremlin reception. 

The outcome of the never-ending dialectic is a constant struggle 
for  position  which  involves  not  only  decision-makers,  inter-
veners, and political parties, but also other organized elements in 
the  community.  Every  action,  be  it a  government  decision  or a 
voluntary association  officer's  resignation,  is  interpreted as  a  po-
litical move, even when it is not. The participants in the dialectic 
always seek  total victory, for compromise is viewed as  a  defeat by 

•  354  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

the holders of power, as  "selling out" by the interveners, and as a 
"deal"  by  the  uninvolved  citizenry.  Consequently,  all  relation-
ships  take  place  in  an  atmmphere  of  suspicion  and  tension.  Ex-
perienced politicians,  whether  in city  hall  or in  a  voluntary asso-
ciation,  are  accustomed  to  this  state  of affairs,  and  the  amateurs 
eventually  become  resigned  to  it,  but  the  citizens  see  it  as  shot 
through with dishonesty and hypocrisy.  Since it does. not concern 
them  vitally,  however,  they  play  the  bemused  bystanders,  and 
chalk it up to "politics." 27 

This  view  of  the  decision-making  process  departs  somewhat 
from  the  contemporary  political  science  conception  which  em-
phasizes  the  role  of  power  structures,  informal  bodies  that  mo-
nopolize  or  dominate  community  decision-making.  One  theory 
isolates  permanent  power elites,  composed  of a  small  set  of  indi-
vidual  leaders  and  interest  groups  (mainly  from  the  business 
community)  which  has  sufficient  power  to  make  decisions  with-
out  paying  attention  to  the  citizenry.28  Another-more  reason-
able-theory identifies a  number of individual  (and often tempo-
rary)  power  structures,  each  generated  by  a  specific  issue,  with 
some  overlap  in  membership  depending  on  the  total  array  of 
issues  and  the  distribution  of  power  in  the  particular  commu-
nity.29  This model  leaves  more  room  for  citizens,  since  the  poli-
ticians  representing  them  can  incorporate  their demands  in  the 
decision-making process. 

My analysis  tends  to  follow  the second  theory,  but being con-
cerned  not  only  with  how  decisions  are  made  but  also  with  the 
responsiveness  of  the  process  to  the  community,  I  have  placed 
more  stress  on  the role  of citizens.  Their activities  do  not,  how-
ever,  preclude  the  existence  of  a  power  structure  in  Levittown, 
for  the  incumbent  party  leaders,  elected  officials,  and  the  Levitt 
organization  constituted  such  a  structure.  Indeed,  as  I  noted  in 
Chapter Seven, the builder's imposing influence, the power of the 
Democratic  party  leader  and  the  Catholic  bloc,  as  well  as  some 
distinctive  features  of  the  community,  have  made  the  power 
structure somewhat more monolithic  than  those  found  by politi-
cal  scientists  in  established  communities,  although  its  members 
tend  to  be  leading  citizens,  politicians,  and  municipal  officials 
rather  than  business  leaders.  As  a  purely residential  community, 
Levittown lacked the array of commercial and industrial interests 
that  are  usually  found  at  the  top  of  the  political  pyramid,  and 
gave a  larger role to organizational officers and vote-bloc  leaders. 

The  Decision-making  Process 

Since  the  community  was  still  under  construction,  the  builder 
played  an  unsually  prominent  role;  and  since  the  community 
was  still  new,  political  issues  had  not  yet  become  sufficiently  di-
versified  to generate a  wide variety of power structures. Also,  as  a 
suburban  middle  class  community,  Levittown  was  without  the 
low-income, nonwhite population which makes up a sizeable pro-
portion of the  urban constituency, but is  nevertheless  largely  ex-
cluded from  the decision-making process by poverty, segregation, 
low  political  skill,  and  its  habitual  support  of  Democratic  ma-
chine  candidates.  Even  the  most  excluded  interveners  in  Levit-
town were therefore more adequately represented in  the decision-
making process  than are the Negro lower class citizens of Chicago 
or New Haven. 

IMPROVING  THE  DECISION-MAKING  PROCESS 

The  picture  I  have  drawn  of  Levittown's  politics  and  decision-
making  is  not  a  pretty  one,  and  it would  be  easy  to  charge  the 
community's  political  institutions  with  being  undemocratic  and 
ineffective. To do so would be to assume  that they could function 
according to formal  democratic  theory,  but the self-righteousness 
of such an assumption  will  not eliminate  the conflicting realities 
of American political  behavior. If a community is  heterogeneous, 
and  if  the  citizens  restrict .their  participation  to  periodic  ballot-
ing except  when  their  personal  interests  are  at  stake,  yet  expect 
the decision-makers to observe altruistic democracy,  the resulting 
political  system  will  produce  decision-makers  and  decisions  that 
cater  to  majority  wishes  at  election  and  powerful  minority  de-
mands between  times,  hiding the process  behind the performing 
fa\ade.  However flawed  this system may be, people will be willing 
to maintain it-even while grumbling about its faults-so long as 
they  need  or  want  to  maintain  heterogeneity,  nonparticipation, 
and the electoral system of majority rule. 

Politics  could  only  be  different  if  people's  political  behavior 
and  values  or  government's  functions  would  change.  If citizens 
were so homogeneous  that differences about issues were minimal, 
feedback restriction,  the performance, and other means of coping 
with  heterogeneity  would  be  unnecessary; 
the  voters  could 
simply  hire  the  best  trained  or  most  highly  motivated  among 
them to carry out the popular consensus. If everyone participated 
in  government  as  intensely as  in  the  family,  all  decisions  would 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

receive  considerable  discussion,  decision-makers  would  be  more 
responsive  to  the  constituency,  and  performances  to  hide  dis-
agreement  would  no  longer  be  needed,  although  some  fonn  of 
caucus might be required to hammer out agreement among hete-
rogeneous  citizens.  Conversely,  if  government  were  radically 
different,  if  it were  like  the  family  and  provided emotional  sup-
port, and if the political leader were really a father figure,  people 
would  presumably participate  more,  more  informally,  and with-
out  such  diverse  interests.  And  if it  were  like  the  church,  they 
would  participate  with  less  insistence  on  having  their own  per-
sonal  interests satisfied. 

Such medieval alternatives are abhorrent.  More constructively, 
Paul  Goodman  has  long argued  for  small  communities and gov-
ernmental  decentralization  so  that  people  can  participate  more 
directly;  he advocates,  among other things,  a  school  of one  hun-
dred  students,  to  be  run  by  their  parents.80  If people  were  re-
quired  to  participate,  they  undoubtedly  would,  but if  a  hetero-
geneous  group  of  parents  set  up a  school,  they  might  argue  in-
definitely  about  what  it  should  teach  and  how,  and  the  school 
would never  be  built.  Goodman would argue, and justifiably so, 
that the process of setting up the school will be more educational 
than  its  actual  operation-but then  he  is  not  particularly  inter-
ested  in children learning the technical  skills  for  functioning  in 
the larger society.  Even so,  his idea deserves  to be tried, although 
it may happen that parents and children with less intense interest 
in  education  than  Goodman  himself  would  eventually  delegate 
the  task  to  their  more  highly  motivated  neighbors,  who  would 
then function much like a school board and staff.31 

That  a  small  community  and  a  decentralized  government 
alone  would  increase  participation  is  also  doubtfl!ll.  The  Israeli 
kibbutzim  achieved  almost  total  member  participation  in  gov· 
ernment during the early years, but as soon as the Tecurring crises 
which  threatened  their  existence  had  passed,  many  settlers 
handed  the  decision-making  responsibility  to  people  who  were 
interested in being leaders, and spent their free  time in the same 
individual  and  family  pursuits  found  in  an  American  suburb.82 
What  the  well-educated,  culturally  and  ideologically  homoge-
neous,  and  politically  sophisticated  kibbutz  members  were  un-
willing  to  do cannot  be  expected  from  American  suburbanites. 
Yet  even  if  people  like  the  Levittowners  were  dissatisfied 
enough with the status quo to demand or accept decentralization, 

The  Decision-making  Process 

•  857  • 

the  decision-making  process  would  not  change  significantly  so 
long as  they believe  that altruistic democracy ought to determine 
governmental  operations.  This  belief stems  from  three  sources: 
the  schools,  the  citizens'  detachment  from  the  political  process, 
and  their application  of  primary-group  morality  to  it. 

The modern public school  was  founded as  part of an intensely 
antipolitical  nineteenth  century  social  movement;  it  has  there-
fore  taught altruistic democracy for  over a  hundred  years,  keep-
ing  the  realities  of  politics  out of  its  courses.  Many  teachers  as-
sume  naively  that  if  students  learn  only  an  ideal  concept  of 
politics,  they will  put it  into  practice when  they  become  adults, 
and  thereby  reform  society.  Educators  are  also  often  conserva-
tive;  they  see  government  itself as  nonpolitical,  and  think  only 
those who question its decisions are acting politically. Politics be-
ing evil,  the  efforts  of  the  interveners are  left  out of  the curric-
ulum.33  More  sophisticated  teachers  can  be  found  here  and 
there,  but  schools  are  not  supposed  to  generate  controversy,  so 
that  social  studies  ,courses  favor  history  and  antiseptic  descrip-
tions  of  current  events.34  In  many  communities,  teachers  who 
bring  political  controversies  into  the  classroom  have  found  that 
disagreeing  parents communicate  their  opposition  to  the  school 
board,  forcing  them  to  go  back  to  teaching  noncontroversial 
ideals. 

What students fail  to  learn  in  school  they  pick up later when 
they  need  it,  and  if  the  civics  curriculum  has  any  influence  on 
adult  beliefs  it  is  largely  because  most  citizens are  so  untouched 
by  governmental  activities  that  they  have  no  need  for  more 
realistic  beliefs.  Faith  in  altruistic  democracy  is  a  direct  conse-
quence  of  the  irrelevance  of government  to  their  everyday  lives 
and aspirations. As a result,  they apply primary-group morality to 
politics,  believing  that  politics  should  be  guided  by  the  same 
norms  that rule family  relationships and friendship,  and  that de-
viations  can  be  explained  by  the  personal  dishonesty  of  indi-
vidual  politicians.  In  the  process,  their  lack  of  consciousness 
about  self-interest  in  primary-group  relations  is  transferred  to 
their political role as well. 

The alternative  to  this  state  of  affairs  is  not  relinquishing  of 
faith in democracy or morality,  but for  the citizenry to  be "polit-
icized"-to  learn  that  politics  is  a  universal  phenomenon;  that 
all  matters about which  disagreement  exists  are  by nature  polit-
ical;  that the resolution  of disagreement is  the role of the  politi-

•  358  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

ciao, and that this role  is  guided by nonfamilial  norms.  Politici-
zation  requires  a  relativistic  outlook,  the  pluralistic  assumption 
that  other  people's  interests  may  be as  moral  as  one's  own,  and 
the  ability  to  accept  compromise.  In  addition,  people  have  to 
realize  that everyone's demands are a  mixture of self-interest and 
community concern, and  to restrain the temptation of condemn-
ing  nonaltruistic  demands.  For  example,  Levittowners  should 
have  been pleased rather than disturbed that self-interest by vol-
untary  associations  motivated  them  to  provide  community  ser-
vices  that  would  not  have  existed  otherwise.  Unfortunately,  al-
truistic democracy encourages people to judge political events by 
the  motives  of  the  pa£ticipants,  instead of by  their actions.  The 
goodness of a  decision  cannot,  however,  be determined  from  the 
decision-makers'  motives--even if these could be identified-but 
only  from  the  consequences  of  that  decision  for  the  individual 
and the community. 

Politicization,  pluralism,  a  broader  view  of  self-interest,  and 
the substitution of action  for  motive  in judging decisions would 
make for  effective democracy.  Politics would  become more open 
and  above  board,  and  disagreement  and  conflict  would  be  ac-
cepted  without  the  undesirable  side  effects  that  develop  when 
these  are  repressed  through  performances.  Distrust of politicians 
would  also  be  reduced,  and  once  people  realize  that  politicians 
usually  act  as  they  do  because  of  the  pressures  on  them,  they 
would learn in yet another way that they have to intervene in the 
decision-making process themselves if they want change. 

Beliefs cannot  be altered by demonstrating  their inapplicabil-
ity or irrationality, however,  and new ones cannot be created by 
appealing  to  people  to  be  sensible.  They  usually  change  when 
the  situations  and  institutions  in  which  people  participate  un-
dergo change, for people generally adopt the beliefs that support 
actions  needed  to  achieve  goals.  Consequently,  politicization 
would  best  be  achieved  if  people  were  required  to  participate 
more directly and actively in politics--but this process requires a 
drastic  reorganization  of  government,  and  of  the  government-
citizen relationship, which is not likely to happen. 

More  feasible  changes  can  perhaps  be  implemented.  People 
might  begin  to  see  politics  differently  if  reporters  would  cover 
the  actual  rather  than  the  performing  government,  and  if  they 
described it in  terms of the resolution of conflicting interests, re-
lating decisions  to  the  interplay of  interests  and  to  the  perspec-

The  Decision-making  Process

tives,  political  positions, and  background characteristics of inter-
est  groups.  Some  reporters  and  columnists  already cover  federal 
politics this way,  although  primarily for  well-educated readers. A 
drastic revision of social  studies and civics courses, particularly at 
the high  school  level,  would also  help,  but students would  learn 
most effectively by doing-by participating in municipal govern-
ment as  interns or administrative aides or undertaking studies of 
local  politics  and  decision-making.  This approach  might also  be 
politically  less  risky  than  classroom  discussion  of  controversial 
topics,  but ultimately,  the  schools  must be pressed  (and enabled) 
to give up the  idea  that education  is  above  politics.  Pluralism  is 
already  being taught,  at least  with  regard  to racial  and  religious 
differences,  but  the  more  crucial  pluralism  of  class  (and  all  its 
cultural and political  implications) is  now discussed onfy in some 
college  sociology  courses,  and  then  only  in  the  more  cosmopol-
itan  universities.  Moreover,  pluralism  is  not  produced  just  by 
teaching  it,  and  unfortunately,  it  seems  to  be  more  acceptable 
with  regard  to  matters  in  which  people  are  less  intensively  in-
volved, such as religious doctrine. 35 

None of these  proposals will  have much  impact, for  the  politi-
cal belief system I  am advocating is  presently held only by profes-
sional  politicians,  whose  activities  require  that  they  think  this 
way.  Ultimately, all  suggestions for improvement require greater 
political participation, and this solution is  illusory.  In an affluent 
society,  people like the Levittowners get what they want from  the 
corporate  economy,  from  a  federal  government  which  subsidizes 
that  economy  for  their  benefit,  and  from  local  governments 
which  they  elect  to  protect  their  residential  status.  Unlike  poor 
people,  who are  increasingly dependent  on government  for  jobs 
and  incomes,  middle  class  people  have  no need  to  participate or 
intervene,  except  on  the  rare  occasions  when  government  de-
prives them of goods,  status, or privileges  they have come to  take 
for granted. 

Some Modest Proposals for  Change 

If "radical"  solutions are often mere dreams  that only uphold 
the  radical  requirement  for  total  change  of  "the  system,"  more 
modest proposals for  improvement may,  however,  have a chance. 
Political communication can be increased in several  ways,  not  to 
eliminate feedback  restriction  or even  to  increase voluntary citi-
zen  feedback  (both  of which  seem  utopian),  but  to  generate  in-

•  360  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

voluntary  feedback  and  to upgrade  its diversity so  that decision-
makers are forced  to notice all  possible viewpoints in the  popula-
tion.  One solution would be  the establishment  of a  civic associa-
tion which,  like  traditional  ones,  allows  people  to air  their opin-
ions  on  important issues,  but which also  solicits  them  through  a 
community  public opinion  poll  that  regularly  reports  the  views 
of a random sample of residents on current issues and new  policy 
proposals.  The poll could be financed  by selling its reports to the 
local  press  and  by  also  doing  special  studies  for  local  organiza-
tions and businesses.  Its operating costs could be reduced by hav-
ing  high  school  students  do  the  research  as  part  of  their  social 
studies courses  (which  would  also  give  th'em  a  useful  and educa-
tional  community  function),  and  whatever  deficits  remained 
could  be  met  from  municipal  subsidies.  The  association  could 
also  publish  its  own  newspaper,  giving a  few  pages  in  each  issue 
to  the  political  parties  to  add  diversity  (albeit  partisan)  to  the 
exchange  of  ideas,  and  allowing  more  citizen  feedback  by  pub-
lishing  letters  of  ideas  and  grievances.88  The  information  vac-
uum created  by  the actual  government and  the resulting rumors 
could be alleviated by a regular column which  publishes the cur-
rent  rumors,  together  with  whatever  facts  are  available  to  sup-
port, reject, or correct them. 

The  proposed  civic  association  can  only  succeed  if  it decides 
from  the  start  to  be  political,  rather  than  "above"  politics.  It 
need not  take  sides,  but it must draw members and officers  from 
all  political  groups,  including  party  factions;  otherwise,  it  will 
become the satellite of a single political group which will then do 
its  utmost  to  exclude  opposition  groups.  The  association  must 
also  obtain  authority,  either  by  force  of  law  or  by  attracting 
widespread  citizen  support,  so  that  decision-makers  will  be  re-
quired to pay attention to its activities and findings. 

Communication from  government to citizens can be improved 
by  increased  press  coverage,  particularly  of  the  actual  govern-
ment,  although  outside  funds  from  foundations  or  the  federal 
government would be needed to hire more and better-trained re-
porters.  The system  of mutual  obligation  between  reporters and 
their sources could be made  less  pervasive  if local  reporters were 
organized  into a  guild,  so  that  politicians who  threaten  to with-
hold news from  particularly inquisitive newsmen could not favor 
more  cooperative ones  from  competing papers.  A  more  effective 
solution  would  be  to  bring  in  outside  reporters  periodically  to 

The  Decision-making  Process 

•  361  • 

cover the local community for a short time. They would function 
like  the  expert  or  the  stranger  who  can  offer  a  fresh  view,  and 
being outsiders,  they would be free  of  the system  of mutual obli-
gation and could not be punished for  their n;portage. To prevent 
local  reporters  from  sabotaging outsiders  for  making  them  look 
incompetent,  the  system  would  have  to  be  reciprocal,  with  two 
communities exchanging reporters. If the local  press is  unwilling 
to  print  the  outsiders'  stories--as  it  well  might  be-they could 
appear  in  the  civic  association  paper  or in  the  press  of a  nearby 
city which is not obligated to local  political institutions. 

But  perhaps  the  best  way  of  improving  both  communication 
and  decision·makers'  responsiveness  would  be  to  enlarge  the 
elected bodies. Three or five  or even nine men cannot adequately 
represent  the  diversity  of  a  typical  community,  particularly  its 
minority elements, and yet less so  when they stand for  re-election 
only  every  second  or  third  year.  If the  municipal  government, 
the school  board, and other public bodies were  manned by  15  to 
20  officials,  the  voters  could  express  their  views  of  government 
operations  more regularly and  more quickly,  and  minority  posi· 
tions  would  receive  more  adequate  representation.  Responsive-
ness would increase further if the heads of all  municipal  agencies 
were also elected, offering their policies for citizen review and en-
abling  candidates  with  alternative  policies  to  compete  for  the 
office.  Even  the  city  manager  and  planner  might  stand  for  elec-
tion,  provided  candidates  who  ran  against  them  were  equally 
qualified  professionals  and  if  their  departments  included  ap-
pointed  technical  directors  to  provide  some  continuity.  Making 
more offices  elective  could result  in more  partisan decisions,  and 
would  eliminate appointed  officials  who are  now  politically  free 
to  pursue  the  public  interest  and  attend  to  minority  demands, 
but  these  costs  are  balanced  by  the  benefit  of  a  more  explicitly 
political  and  representative  government.  Safeguards  to  protect 
the  public  interest  and  minority  needs  would  be  necessary  (see 
Chapter  Fourteen),  as  would  new  incentives  to  recruit  candi-
dates.  Being an elected  official  in a  small  community is  a  thank-
less  task,  for  the  financial  rewards  are  minimal  and  emotional 
ones  are  almost  nonexistent.  Like  actors,  politicians  are  bathed 
by the public spotlight, but unlike actors,  their audiences neither 
pay  nor sit  politely  to  watch  them  perform;  they  come,  instead, 
to demand and complain. As  long as  the politician must reconcile 
conflicting interests,  there  is  no  way  of making his  role  more re-

spected or satisfying,  although a  higher salary might compensate 
for  its  emotional  burdens and raise  the status of the  office.87 

Citizen  participation could  be  increased  somewhat by  electing 
citizen  advisory committees  to  every municipal  agency,  although 
it might  be difficult  to  recruit  enough  ordinary citizens and pre-
vent domination  by  political  party members.  A  more  feasible  so-
lution,  based  on  the  assumption  that  people  participat~:  only 
when  personal  interests  are  at  stake,  would  be  to adapt  the con-
cept  of  "maximum  feasible  participation"  of  the  antipoverty 
effort  or  the  concept  of  the  civilian  review  board  that  oversees 
the  police  to  the  entire community,  providing  for  the  participa-
tion  or  representation  of  affected  citizens  in  welfare,  public 
health,  recreation,  education,  planning,  and  other  public  agen-
cies.  If students,  as  well  as  more  parents,  participated  in  school 
board  decisions,  public  education  might  not  be  better  by  aca-
demic standards,  but it would  be more responsive  to  their needs. 
Of  course,  it  might  also  deteriorate,  for  parents  and  students 
would  rarely  opt  for  the  public  interest  or  long-range  school 
needs,  and  the  majority  might vote  against  satisfying  the  educa-
tional needs of a minority-but these are the costs of local democ-
racy. 

The decision-making process  and  the qualities of  the decision-
makers are not easily changed, and criticizing their shortcomings 
is  unproductive  because  it  does  not  get  at  the  real  problems. 
They  act  as  they  do  because  they  must  resolve  conflicting  de-
mands,  and  if  they are  poorly  trained,  shortsighted,  uninterested 
in long-range planning, and overly concerned with  their political 
party  and  the  next  election,  they  only  reflect  the  values  of  the 
voters they represent and the political system  in which they must 
function.  Radical  solutions  could  of  course  be  proposed,  either 
an elitist one in which trained experts replace  the elected officials 
or a  pure democracy in which people are somehow encouraged to 
make  their  own  decisions,  but  the  first  is  undesirable  and  the 
second is not feasible. 

A  more  practicable  solution  is  to  recruit  professional  politi-
cians for  the decision-making roles.  Much of what  is  wrong with 
government  in  Levittown  is  that  the  present  incumbents  are 
amateurs  who share  the  voters'  naivete about  the  political  proc-
ess  and  cannot cope  with  the  realities  of  decision-making  when 
they  are  elected.  Believing  in  the  theory  of altruistic  democracy 
even  while defending their own and  their constituents'  interests, 

The  Decision-making  Process 

they  identify  these  with  the  public  interest.  As  a  result,  the 
decision-making  process  becomes  a  debate  among  unself-con-
scious,  well-intentioned,  but  unsophisticated  amateurs  who  be-
have  in  ways  that  they  consider  undesirable  and  undemocratic 
because  they have little choice to do otherwise, and then take out 
their  frustrations  on  the  interveners.  Unable  to  deal  with  the 
emotional  conflict  between  what  they  have  to  do  and  what  they 
think  they  ought  to  do,  they  seal  themselves  off  from  feedback 
more  than  is  necessary,  try  to  stifle  disagreement,  and  cut down 
on the effective democracy that is  possible. 

The  professional  politician,  whether  a  full-time  or  part-time 
practitioner,  sees  decision-making as  a  vocation,  rather  than as  a 
duty and a  cause.  He is  politicized and pluralistic, and can  func-
tion  as  a  broker between  groups.  But the qualities  of  the profes-
sional  have  some  disadvantages  too.  The detachment that breeds 
a  political  other-directedness  which  sensitizes  the  professional  to 
the  conflicting demands  of a  pluralistic  constituency  also  makes 
him less  responsive  to  the problems of the community as  a  whole 
and to long-range needs,  to demands of powerless minorities, and 
indeed,  to  all  issues  in  which  conflicting  pressures  are  absent  or 
irrelevant. In situations where the decision-maker is  free  to act as 
he  sees  fit,  the  morally committed amateur  may come up with  a 
more desirable decision than the professional. 

Moreover,  the  professional  politician  will  probably be no bet-
ter  than  the  amateur  in  decision-making  skill.  Neither  his  role 
nor  his  personality  motivates  him  to  undertake  systematic  anal-
yses  of community problems or to develop policies that deal with 
causes  of  problems.  His  approach  to  policy  is  likely  to  be  even 
more  intuitive  and  unsystematic  than  the  amateur's  and  most 
sensitive  to  the  political  currents  that  flow  around  him  twenty-
four  hours a  day.  The  professional  may also  be  cynical  and  per-
sonally unreliable, making different promises to different people, 
and  telling voters  only what  they  want  to  hear-all  without  ex-
cessive  personal  guilt.  Perhaps  this  is  the  price  of  reaching  de· 
cisions  in  a  heterogenous  community. 

The alternative,  then,  is  between  the committed amateur who 
can-respond best to the wishes of his own group and the detached 
professional  who  can  shape  conflicting  interests  into  a  workable 
compromise.  The  former  is  most  effective  under  conditions  of 
consensus;  the latter, under conditions of conflict.  Since issues on 
which  there  is  consensus  are  rare,  the  drawbacks  of  the  profes-

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

sional  politician  are  less  serious  than  the  amateur's.  This choice 
may well  violate  the  faith  of democratic  theory  in  the  ability of 
the disinterested citizen  to  produce democratic government,  but 
then this theory was  itself formulated in reaction against  the  pro-
fessional  politicians who ran  the governments,  parties,  and  polit-
ical  machines  (rural  as  well  as  urban)  of  eighteenth  and  nine-
teenth century Europe and America. 

Nevertheless,  whether  the  decision-maker  is  an  amateur  or 
even an expert, his decisions will  not differ significantly from  the 
professional's,  for  these  are  largely  determined  by  his  political 
role rather than by his personality or training. Significant change 
can take place only if new and different pressures impinge on the 
decision-makers.  Improved  political  communication  will  help, 
and  so  would  more  electoral  offices  and  elected  citizen  advisors, 
but  the  burden  must  fall  largely  on  intervention.  Interveners 
must realize that change is  likely to come about only as a result af 
their efforts to  upset the political equilibrium. 

Intervention  can  be  improved  in  a  variety  of  ways.  Formal 
devices  include more opportunities to hold referenda, giving citi-
zens  the  right  to  introduce  legislation,  and  (in  communities 
larger  than  Levittown)  decentralizing  municipal  functions  and 
powers  so  that  government  becomes  more  accessible  to  the aver-
age  citizen.  Educating  people  about  the  importance  of interven-
tion  and  about  its  most  effective  methods  would  help,  for  ex-
ample,  by  teaching  leaders  the  significance  of  organizing  and 
bringing significant  numbers  of  citizens  to  governmental  meet-
ings instead of relying on moral appeals and angry attacks. And if 
residents  could  be encouraged  to  direct the complaints  they now 
make  largely  to  friends  and  neighbors  to  the  decision-makers 
themselves,  everyday  gripes  would  become  instruments  of  inter-
vention.  Complaint  bureaus  serve  this  function,  but  nothing  is 
more  successful  than  direct  confrontations  with  the  governing 
body.  Interveners  must  also  be  trained  to concentrate  on  intro-
ducing  new  facts  and  ideas  into  the  decision-making  process.  A 
community  opinion  poll  would  isolate  the  distribution  and  di-
versity of views, enabling interveners to show the decision-makers 
when  they  are  not sufficiently  informed about  citizens'  feelings. 
But the most badly needed facts  are on the consequences of al-
ternative  decisions.  Here decision-making is  presently  most defi-
cient,  for neither decision-makers nor interveners make  any  real 
effort  to  catalog  the  consequences,  political  and  nonpolitical, 

The  Decision-making  Process 

long-range and short-range, of alternative decisions. Such a  task is 
probably  too complex  for  either decision-makers  or  interveners. 
They and their community would be helped by an agency which 
systematically  developed  cost-benefit  analyses  for  major  alterna-
tive decisions, even on a rough and imprecise basis. This function 
might be  taken  on  by the civic association  (aided  by high  school 
students  to  carry  on  the  needed  research),  but  a  professional 
agency could do it better, and a  regional one which serviced local 
communities with  such  analyses  would  do  it most  effectively.  In 
theory,  this  task  is  the  proper function  of a  planning agency,  for 
benefit·cost analysis  is  a  major  component  of  the  modern  plan-
ning method. 

More effective  intervention  is  no cure-all,  and the  interveners 
may not succeed  very  often,  but sometimes  the  Davids  do  defeat 
the  Goliaths.  No  one,  not  even  the  decision-makers  themselves, 
knows in advance how much pressure or what new facts and ideas 
may cause  them  to  change  their  minds.  They may  be  impressed 
by an argument or a  show of strength;  they could get an  idea  for 
a  better compromise, and they might help the interveners to gain 
support  from  a  new constituency.  Even  if  the  odds seem  doubt-
ful,  there  is  no other choice  but intervention.  M?st of the  time, 
interveners will lose,  but sometimes they can win, and no one can 
predict when.

1.  Most Jews  were  Democrats,  but  there  was  no evidence  of  the  ex-
istence  of  a  "Jewish  vote,"  particularly  since  no  issues  arose  to 
generate such  a vote. 

2.  Several  elected  officials  and  party  leaders  earned  their  livings  as 
real  estate  or  insurance  brokers  and,  of  course,  sought  (and  ob-
tained)  municipal  contracts whenever  possible.

the  heat  of  political  battle. 

14.  After  C.A.P.S.  met  with  the  school  board,  its  members  were  in-
vited  to help  the school  staff  by  doing research-the former  hop-
ing that the proper facts would result in a change of school policy, 
the  latter intending  to  keep  them  busy  so  that  they  would  stop 
questioning  the  school  board  policy.  In  the  end,  neither  group 
achieved  its  aim. 

15.  It is  also  affected  by  the  other  sources  of  available  feedback,  for 
the kindergarten entry age issue showed  that the less  the decision-
makers  know  about  how  the  community  feels,  the  smaller  the 
number of interveners needed.

is  described  in  detail by  Merton  (1957).  See  also  Dobriner  (1958)

19.  See also Merton (1957),  pp. 399, 402-406. 
20.  In  the  analysis  that  follows,  I  treat  the  cosmopolitan  group  as 
more  cohesive  than  it actually  is,  and  neglect  some  of  the  differ-
ences of opinion among individuals. 

21.  These  principles  were  also  a  source  of  cultural  differentiation 
which  allowed  them  to  maintain  their  status  position.  For  ex-
ample,  their  belief  that  they  were  more  civic-minded  than  other 
Levittowners enabled them to retain their sense of personal worth, 
and  the  hostility  they  generated  as  a  result  allowed  them  to  feel 
that they were of higher status, regardless of how much they were 
scorned  for  advocating  "Brookline  values." 

22.  Of course,  in some  cases,  the  decision-makers  were  just checking 
to find  out where  the cosmopolitans stood on  an issue so  that the 
latter could be more easily neutralized when  they  began  to  inter-
vene  publicly. 

The  Decision-making  Process 

23.  Even  the President of the United States has limited ability  to per-
suade the government to bend to his wishes.  See, e.g.,  Sorenson. 
24.  An  expert  may  also  be  hired  by  decision-makers  to  legitimate  a 
decision  they have  already reached  and  by interveners  to  support 
their  demands  with  facts  and  expertise.  Under  these  conditions, 
he functions  as  a  resource  person;  he  is  an  intervener  only  if he 
comes  with an  opportunity  to make  or change  a  decision  that di-
verts  the  actual  government  from  its  routine  path,  regardless  of 
who sponsors him. 

25.  When  he is  willing  to  conform  to working class  values,  however, 
his  advice  may  be  accepted.  For  example,  a  Levittown  working 
class  politician  who  opposed  the  city  manager,  because  he  ex-
pected him to  eliminate patronage jobs usually  taken  by  working 
class  constituents,  was  quick  to  call  in  an  expert  to  set  up  the 
fire  company  he  had  organized.

urban  political  process, see  Dye  (1962).

of  Levittown,  is  to  be  found  in  Goodman  (1961),  and  in  my  re-
sponse  in  the  "Letters" section  of Commentary,  Vol.  32  (Novem-
ber 1961),  pp. 436-437. 

32.  See,  e.g., Vallier. 
33·  Friedenberg,  pp.  138-140. 
34·  Levittown's  social  studies  courses  emphasized  the  Indians  who 
once  lived  in  the  area  more  than  current  problems  in  the  com-
munity. They also dealt  as  much  with  the  history  and geography 
of foreign  countries as  with  American  society. 

35·  For  example,  working  class  people,  who  are  usually  little  inter-
ested in civic affairs, view society more relativistically as composed 
of people "all  trying to get their own," as one Levittowner put it, 
and  deceive  themselves  less  than  middle  class  people  about  the 
possibilities  of  altruistic  democracy.  A  number  of  studies  have 
shown  that  cynicism  is  lower  among  the  affluent  and  well  edu-
cated.  Milbrath,  p.  So. 

36.  Such  a  newspaper  could  also  be  subsidized  by  the  community. 
A  community  radio  program  in  which  listeners  could  call  up  to 
voice  their ideas and complaints would also be useful. Such a  pro-
gram has  been on the air in  Levittown,  Pennsylvania, for years. 
37·  Higher salaries might  also  increase  citizens'  resentment,  for,  lack-
ing understanding of the  politicians'  functions,  people do not see 
how they "earn" the low salaries they now get.

THE  PROPOSALS  MADE  IN  THE  PRECEDING  CHAPTER  FOR  IMPROVING 
the decision-making process  would not change  it significantly;  it 
would still be  political and would most often result  in "popular" 
decisions. Since such decisions may lead to tyranny of the majority 
and  neglect  of  the  public  interest,  one  must  ask  whether  non-
political  decision-making  processes  and  "unpopular"  decisions 
are  possible  in  a  political  system  like  Levittown's,  and  under 
what conditions they are desirable.  In order to answer these ques-
tions,  it  is  useful  to  begin  with  a  brief  evaluation  of  decisions 
reached  by political means. 

POLITICAL  AND  NONPOLITICAL  DECISION-MAKING 

Among  the  politically  reached decisions  during  the  tim~ of  my 
study  were:  the  sale  of  liquor,  the  admission  of  nonresident 
doctors,  the  kindergarten  entry age,  the  tax  rate,  and  "the juve-
nile problem."  The liquor decision was,  in my opinion,  handled 
poorly, for  the decision-makers arbitrarily rejected majority opin-
ion,  although  the  citizens  were  able  to  overturn  them  because 
New Jersey law permits referenda on this issue.  The "wets" were 
not  really  inconvenienced,  however;  they  only  had  to  go  to  the 
next  township  to  find  package  stores  and  taverns.  The nonresi-
dent doctor issue  was  resolved more adequately,  for  the citizenry 
seemed to be ambivalent, and the decision-makers reached a com-
promise,  permitting  some  nonresident  doctors  (including  the 
specialists  who  would  otherwise  not  have  come),  yet  without 

•  368

Politics  and  Planning 

creating commercial enclaves in residential areas and thus threat-
ening  those  fearing  a  reduction  in  property  values  and  status. 
The  kindergarten  controversy  was  also  resolved  adequately,  for 
people who wanted  to  keep  their  children  home as  long  as  pos-
sible were satisfied,  but so was the minority, which was eventually 
able  to  enroll  children  earlier  through  a  voluntary  testing  pro-
gram. 

The  several  tax  rate  decisions  were  handled  poorly;  but  I 
doubt  whether  the decision-makers  had  any  other choice.  They 
raised taxes because they had to,  but as  little as  possible to satisfy 
the  antitax majority.  Their decision-making process  was  erratic, 
but  then  the  intensity  of  majority  feelings  varied  from  year  to 
year, and so  did the intervention of  the minority favoring  higher 
municipal  budgets.  Although  the  initial  popular  opposition  to 
taxes stemmed primarily from the precipitous increase in  the tax 
rate brought about by the builder's withdrawal of subsidies to  the 
school  budget,  the  fact  remains  that  he  provided  considerable 
sums  to  keep  taxes  low  in the  first  two years.  After the  tax  rate 
stabilized at the higher level,  popular opposition decreased some-
what,  but principally because  the  decision-makers  knew  that the 
voters would not tolerate further tax hikes. The .community's tax 
base  was  simply  insufficient  to  raise  the  level  of  municipal  ser-
vices (particularly of schools)  to minority demands and still  keep 
the majority of voters happy. 

As  a  byproduct  of  the  tax  debate,  the majority got  the  lower 
middle class  schooling  it wanted for  its children,  but the cosmo-
politans were deprived.  Since  the  ideal  solution,  satisfying  both 
majority and minority,  was  impossible,  one cannot quarrel  with 
the final  solution. It seems wrong to argue,  as did  the cosmopoli-
tans,  that all children should be exposed to an upper middle class 
education.  Parents  have  the  right  to  socialize  their  children  in 
their  own  class,  provided  some  alternatives  are  available  for  the 
mobile  (both  upward  and  downward).  Without  an  intensive 
study  of  the  Levittown  schools,  it  is  impossible  to  say  whether 
they  provided  enough  educational  diversity  (for  both  upper 
middle  and  working  class  aspirations).  However  desirable,  such 
diversity is difficult to establish in a small community and hard to 
finance when the majority of voters want lower taxes. 

Possibly, the lower middle class school system which the major-
ity wanted for  its children was  not good enough  by  its standards 
either,  particularly  for  career  preparation.  It  seemed  good 

•  370  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNElU 

enough for  now,  for  its graduates entered lower middle class col-
leges,  and  would  eventually  qualify  for  the  technical  and  other 
white collar jobs  they wanted  in order to  finance  the lower mid-
dle class life styles for which they had been raised. Whether or not 
their education was good enough to train them sufficiently for an 
automating  economy  with  radically  altered  job  opportunities  is 
hard  to  say.  No  one  knows  today  what  jobs  will  be  available  in 
the  future  or whether  the  youngsters  now sitting  in Levittown's 
classrooms are learning enough to qualify for those jobs. Since no 
one could prove that the  school  system  was  clearly inadequate by 
this  criterion,  one  need  not  be  surprised  that  neither  decision-
makers  nor  parents  were  willing  to  change  the  system-even  if 
they  had  known  how  to do it. 

The  "juvenile problem"  was  handled most  poorly of all.  The 
final decision-to do nothing-was popular, of course; not enough 
voters  wanted  adolescent facilities,  citizen  intervention was  min-
imal,  no  expert  interveners were  brought  in  to  testify  to  adoles-
cent  needs,  and  the decision-makers  acted  accordingly.  Even  so, 
the  means  proposed  to  achieve  the  popular  goal  of reducing de-
linquency were irrational.  No one distinguished between serious 
delinquency and  vandalism,  and no one sought  to  find  out how 
the  latter  could  be  eliminated.  Neither  the  Juvenile  Discussion 
Group,  which  asked  voluntary associations  to sponsor adolescent 
recreation  activities,  nor  the  Youth  Commission,  which  set  up a 
Teenage Panel  to punish  the  vandals who were caught, ever con· 
sidered  the  needs of the  teenagers  or  looked  into  ways  of giving 
them  a  social  function  in  the  community~ The  final  solution,  a 
patchwork  of voluntary but adult-run activities and  more  police 
supervision,  did  not  attack  the  basic  causes  of  the problem  and 
was  inadequate,  because  something  could  have  been  done  to 
satisfy  both  adults  and  adolescents.  Teenage  gathering  places 
could  have  been  provided  away  from  residential  and  shopping 
areas,  and  the  teenagers could have established their own center, 
much  as  working  class  adults  built  themselves  a  firehouse  with 
private  fund-raising  and  their  own  labor.  The  primary  obstacle 
was  not  cost,  but  adult  fears,  which  might  well  have  been  re-
duced  if  adults  and  adolescents  had  sat  down  together.  The 
decision-making  process  was  inadequate and  undemocratic,  how-
ever, for the adolescents were not represented and could not even 
intervene  to  state  their  demands  or  apprise  adults  of  their  feel-
ings, 

Politics  and  Planning

A  comparison  of  the  five  issues  shows  that  political  decisions 
can  be  both  good and  bad,  and  my  cursory  evaluation  suggests 
some  criteria  for  judging them.  They must  respond  first  to  ma-
jority demands,  but  the  more  they  can  also  satisfy  minority  de-
mands, the better.  Often,  they can also be rational without polit-
ical  ill effects;  they  ought  to address  themselves  to  the  causes  of 
problems,  and  unless  popular demand  for  irrational  solutions  is 
politically  overpowering,  experts  can  be  used  to  bring solutions 
as  close  to rationality as  possible. 1  Minorities  have  to rely  on in-
tervention, but it must be effective,  so  that  the minority's  power 
is  expressed to the fullest.  It can also be rational, using experts to 
expose  majority  irrationality  and  to  propose  compromises  that 
would  optimize  benefits  on  both  sides.  Above  all,  the  decision-
making process must be representative;  the people affected by an 
issue must have  the opportunity to state  their demands and exert 
political pressure.  They may not be successful,  but if they are ex-
cluded  from  the  start,  as  the  adolescents  were,  the  decision-
making process is not even properly political. 

Nonpolitical  decision-making processes  rely  principally on ex-
pertise  and  systematic  planning  to  come  up  with  decisions  that 
may not please or interest the majority. In order to consider how 
they can be effective in a  political system that caters to the major-
ity,  I  want to resort again to case studies, analyzing two such pro-
cesses in some detail. 

THE  RACIAL  DESEGREGATION  OF  LEVITTOWN 2 

Levittown's  desegregation  was  accomplished  through  nonpoliti-
cal  means,  enforcing  a  decision  made  outside  the  community, 
and,  like  most  nonpolitical  decisions,  it was  not  favored  by  the 
community's  majority.  Even  so,  effective  expertise  and  rational 
planning  produced  an  outcome  that guaranteed  minority rights 
without harming the majority, and indeed, even pleased the peo-
ple who had been opposed to integration. 

The question of desegregating  Levittown  came  up before any 
purchasers had arrived, and was  raised  by the builder himself. In 
spring  1958,  at a  press  conference  to  publicize  the  imminent be-
ginning  of  the  new  community,  William  Levitt  permitted  him-
self  to be questioned by reporters.  They knew  that  the firm  had 
not  previously  sold  to  Negroes;  that  Levittown,  Pennsylvania, 
had  experienced  a  racial  disturbance  when  a  Negro  family 

•  372  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

bought a  house  from  a  white  Levittowner;  and  that  New Jersey 
law  made  it  illegal  to  practice  discrimination  in  housing  sup-
ported  by  federal  subsidies.  Nevertheless,  Levitt  declared  pub-
licly that he would not sell  to Negroes in Levittown,  New Jersey. 
Reactions  were  not long  in  coming.  Senator  Case  requested  the 
Federal  Housing  Administration  (FHA)  to  refuse  mortgage  in-
surance to  Levittown; Governor Meyner was asked to enforce the 
state  law,  and  set  the  State  Division  Against  Discrimination 
to  work;  and  a  Burlington  County  Quaker  group 
(SDAD) 
picketed  the  model  homes  on opening day  and for  the next few 
weeks.  Soon  afterwards,  two  Negroes  who  had  not been allowed 
to  buy  brought  suit  against  Levitt  in  the  state  courts,  arguing 
that  the  availability  of  FHA  mortgage  insurance  for  Levitt 
houses constituted government support. 

The  Levitt  decision  had  not  been  easy.  The  firm  was  under 
pressure  from  the  national  Jewish  community  to  integrate,  and 
Levitt  had  even  made vague  promises  to  pro-integration  groups 
to  admit Negroes after the first  neighborhoods  had  been settled. 
Skeptics thought these promises were intended to reduce pressure 
on  Levittown,  Pennsylvania,  where  the  firm  was  then  having 
trouble selling the last of its houses.  In any case,  the firm  decided 
that the first  priority was economic, and  that immediate integra-
tion  of  the  new  Levittown  would  hurt  sales  to  whites.  Bressler 
writes:  "In defending his  policy  of  racial  exclusion,  Levitt  had 
often had occasion to assert that both as a Jew and a humane man 
he sympathized with the  plight of struggling minorities, but that 
economic  realities  reluctantly,  compelled  him  to  recognize  that 
'most  whites  prefer  not  to  live  in  mixed  communities  .  .  .  the 
responsibility  for  this  is  society's  . . .  it  is  not  reasonable  to 
expect that any one builder could or should undertake to absorb 
the entire risk and burden of conducting such  a  vast social  expe-
riment.'" 8  One of the Levitt executives put the firm's position to 
me  this way:  "Our firm  is  liberal  and  progressive,  but we  don't 
want to  be singled out or used as  the firm  which should start the 
other builders off.  If there is  no other builder who can keep Ne-
groes out, we  will  not do so  either;  we  will  go  with  the group if 
the  state makes  us,  but we  don't want  to  lose  millions by  being 
the first  .  .  .  we could not afford to take such losses.'' 

Although the Levitt family  had not been very active  in behalf 
of  minorities-many  years  earlier  the  firm  discouraged  Jews 
from  an  expensive  housing development on  Long Island-there 

Politics  and  Planning 

•  373  • 

was some justification for the charge that they were being singled 
out.  SDAD  and  pro-integration  groups  were  concentrating  on 
Levittown  because  it  was  by  far  the  largest  new  suburb  in  the 
state  and  because  they  felt  that  if  Levitt  would  integrate,  other 
builders  would  follow  suit.•  Presumably,  being  the  biggest 
builder in  the  East,  he  could pay  the  costs  of  integration-if in-
deed  there  were  any-more  easily  than smaller ones.  Moreover, 
Levittown  had  become  a  national  symbol  of  suburbia  and  a 
brand name  in  housing generally, so  that  the  publicity  value  of 
its integration would be considerable. One could even argue that 
the  firm  had  attracted  more  purchasers  and  profit  because  its 
communities had become  national symbols,  and that it therefore 
deserved being singled out. Even so,  the builder felt he had been 
picked on unjustly. 

As  a  result,  Levitt decided to fight  the suit brought by the two 
Negro applicants, arguing that FHA mortgage insurance did not 
constitute  government  support  of  housing,  but  represented  a 
contract between the FHA and the individual buyer.  Meanwhile, 
Levitt  salesmen  assured  prospective  white  buyers  that,  "It's  all 
politics;  the  other  Levittowns  are  all  white  and  this  one  will 
be  too."  In some  instances  the  "politics" was  attributed to Com-
munists,  in  others,  to  politicians  campaigning  for  votes  in  the 
Negro slums of Newark and Jersey City. 

The suit against  Levitt dragged  on  inconclusively for  most  of 
1959,  without  causing  much  overt  concern  among  potential 
buyers  or  residents.  Participant-observation  data  and  my  at· 
tempts  to start conversations on  t,he  topic suggest  that the major-
ity  of  Levittowners  were  uncomfortably  ambivalent  about  the 
issue.  Some  were  hostile  and  threatened  to  move  or  to  protest 
violently.  These  were  primarily  working  class  people  who  had 
left  the city  because  their neighborhood  was  becoming  predom-
inantly  Negro.a  Unable  to  afford  another  move,  they  were  fear-
ful  that  the  same  mass  invasion  of  lower  class  Negroes  would 
occur in Levittown,  confronting them with a  sudden and visible 
decline  in  property values  and status.  Having just achieved  sub-
urban home ownership, and being at the top of  the working class 
socially  and  occupationally,  they  sensed  that  such  an  invasion 
could only pull down their prestige. A smaller group (mainly the 
cosmopolitans)  was  very  much  in  favor  of  desegregation  and 
many of  them  became  active  in  the  Burlington  County  Human 
Relations  Council.  Principally  Jews,  Quakers,  and  Unitarians, 

•  374  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

some had been active in integration efforts in former residences. 6 
The majority of Levittowners stood between these poles. An atti-
tude survey would  probably have shown  that  they did not favor 
desegregation,  but also  believed  Negroes  had  a  right  to  live  in 
Levittown. 7  They too feared a lower class  invasion, but were able 
to  distinguish  between  middle  class  Negroes,  "those  who  are 
more  like  us,"  and  slum  dwellers,  common  sense  telling  them 
that the latter could not afford to buy in Levittown. Some feared 
intermarriage.  Seeming  to  believe  that  once  Negroes  moved  in, 
they would be integrated socially, white parents were afraid their 
daughters would date Negro boys.8 

Despite the fears,  integration received little attention through-
out  1959.  Minority  factions  in  two  organizations  unsuccessfully 
proposed  by-laws  to  exclude  Negroes,  dissatisfied  buyers  joked 
about  revenging  themselves  on  Levitt  (or  their  neighbors)  by 
selling to  Negroes,  and there was a  brief panic one Sunday when 
a  group of Negroes came  to look at an empty house,  until  it was 
learned  that  they  were  there  to clean  it for  a  new  white  buyer. 
Meanwhile,  some  Negro  maids  had  been  living  "in"  without 
adverse  comment,  and  others came  into  town  daily  as  part-time 
domestics. But then, they were clearly servants and threatened no 
one's status. 

When  the  Appellate  Court  ruled  late  in  1959  that  the  State 
Division  Against  Discrimination  could  hold  public  hearings  on 
the case,  Levitt went  to  the state  Supreme Court.  Knowing  that 
once  public  hearings were  held he would probably be judged in 
violation of the state antidiscrimination law and forced  to deseg-
regate,  he promised  that if the Supreme Court upheld the lower 
court,  he  would  desegregate  without  further  delay,  even  before 
public  hearings.  The  firm's  decision  was  based  on  its  long-
standing  belief  that all  but  the  most  favorable  publicity  about 
Levittown should  be  discouraged,  and  that,  in  this  instance,  the 
publicity  from  the  public  hearings  could  only  scare  away  more 
white  buyers.  Meanwhile,  Levitt  had  attempted  to  obtain  post-
ponements  from  the  lower  courts,  hoping  to  sell  an  all-white 
community  to  as  many  people  as  possible  before  a  higher court 
finally ruled for integration.' 

In  March  196o,  the  state  Supreme Court issued  a  stay  on  the 
case  until  April,  but  toward  the  end  of  March  ministers  and 
township officials were summoned to a  number of conferences at 
the Levitt office building. On Sunday, March 29,  all the ministers 

Politics  and  Planning 

•  375  • 

announced during church services that the Court stay would end 
April  15,  and  that  even  if  it  were  prolonged  while  the  builder 
took  the  case  to  the  U.S.  Supreme Court,  desegTegation  was  in-
evitable.10  Consequently,  the builder had decided  to desegregate 
voluntarily  and  asked  the  community  to  prepare  itself  to  wel-
come  Negro residents.  The decision  was  accepted quietly,  partly 
because  it came  from  the  ministers,  partly  because  the  commu-
nity  had  accepted  the  inevitability  of  integration.  Moreover, 
people knew  that it would  not  take place in their own neighbor-
hoods,  but  in  the  new  one  under  construction.  Also,  the  an-
nouncement stressed the desirability of peaceful integration-and 
as it turned out, Levittowners favored peace and order even more 
than segregation. 

The  desire  for  order  was  a  direct  outcome  of  the  racial  dis-
turbance in the Pennsylvania Levittown. On its arrival  there,  the 
Negro family was  met by a  milling  crowd of about five  hundred 
angry people, and when the local  police was  unable or unwilling 
to restore order,  the state police had to be summoned. Although 
there was  no violence and only  two stones  were  thrown,  the dis-
turbance was  thereaftel' described as a stone-throwing riot, giving 
the  older  Levittown  a  worldwide  reputation  as  a  riot-torn  com-
munity and  placing a  blot  on  its  escutcheon  which  the  residents 
of the newest one wanted desperately  to avoid.U  In fact,  in later 
years,  people  distinguished  the older  Levittown  from  their  own 
as  "the  one  that  had  the  riot."  The  Levitt  organization  also 
wanted  to  avoid  another  disturbance,  fearful  that  a  riot  would 
hurt  sales  more  than  desegregation  itself.  Believing  that  the 
Pennsylvania  disturbance  had  been  caused  by  the  surreptitious-
ness  of  Negro  purchase,  it  sought  to  make  sure  that  the  New 
Jersey community would be desegregated  publicly, and therefore 
set in motion a planning program to achieve this aim. 

Planning  for  Desegregation 

The  builder's  first  step  in  planning  the  desegregation  process 
was  to  hire  an  expert  consultant,  a  recently  retired  director  of 
SDAD.  Given a  free  hand  by  the  firm,  he developed a  five-point 
program:  the  announcement  of  the  Levitt  decision  by  commu-
nity  leaders;  a  thorough  briefing  program  for  the  Levitt  sales 
force,  government  officials,  the  police,  and  the press;  an attempt 
to  discourage  anti-integration  activities,  informally  called  "Op-
eration  Hothead";  the  formation  of  a  community  Human  Rela-

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

tions Council;  and careful screening of the first  Negro applicants 
to make sure that they would be middle class people. 12 

The township governing  body was  initially asked  to  announce 
the  Levitt decision, but its  members were  not especially eager  to 
do so.  Some were personally opposed to integration, but all feared 
association with  the decision  would hurt them politically,  partic-
ularly  since  neither  party  would  take  a  stand. 18  The  ministers 
then  volunteered  to  make  the  announcement.  Most  favored  in-
tegration, and several  knew  that like-minded colleagues in  Levit-
town,  Pennsylvania,  had  been  forced  out  of  their  pulpits  over 
this  issue.  If they  made  the  announcement  in  unison,  no  con-
gregation  could  condemn  its  own  minister,  and  no  individual 
minister could invite anti-integrationists to  his  church to  exploit 
the  then  lively competition  for  congregants. 14  The more  fervent 
pro-integration  ministers  took  leadership  positions  on  the  Hu-
man  Relations  Council,  organized  at  the  same  time,  and  also 
placed some of their lay supporters on it. 13 

The  police  briefing  stressed  methods  to  ensure  the  peaceful 
settling of the  first  Negro  purchasers,  to  head off anti-integration 
demonstrations, and  to prevent the  police  laxity that had existed 
in  the older Levittown. Although the force  was  not especially en-
thusiastic  about  desegregation,  the  police chief was  vitally  inter-
ested  in  making  his  department  the  best  in  Burlington County. 
Since  a  riot would have left a  permanent mark on his  record,  he 
cooperated completely. The press  briefing was  also influenced  by 
events  in  the  older  Levittown.  Several  papers  in  the  Levittown, 
Pennsylvania,  area  had  played  up  the  integration  issue  and  had 
reported  the  address  and  arrival  time  of  the  first  Negro  buyer, 
thus  facilitating  crowd  formation  for  the disturbance.  In  Levit-
town,  New Jersey,  the newspapers agreed  to limit their coverage, 
and  eventually reported  only  the signing of the deed by  the  first 
Negro family.  Press cooperation was  easy  to obtain;  the publisher 
of the local daily also owned the erring Pennsylvania one and was 
eager  to  make  amends.  The Levittown  editor of  the  Burlington 
County weekly,  having seen  the  disturbance  in  the  older  Levit-
town  at  first  hand,  helped  brief  his  colleagues  and  advised  the 
consultant in other ways. 

"Operation  Hothead" was  organized  by  the consultant;  aided 
by  ministers,  reporters,  and  others  who  knew  the  community 
well,  he  made up a  list  of known militant segregationists.  These 
were  then  lectured  sternly  by  their  respective  ministers  and 

Politics  and  Planning 

firmly discouraged from  organizing anti-integration protest.  The 
screening of Negro applicants sought middle class  people able to 
withstand  the  hostility and  isolation  that might come  their way. 
Although this process reassured the builder and local leaders that 
Levittown  would  not  be  invaded  by  poor  Negroes,  the commu-
nity  was  never  told  about  it.  Screening  was  abolished  after  the 
first  Negroes  had  moved  in,  and  the  unscreened  purchasers  who 
came later were quite like the screened ones. 

The  inte!,'Tation  process  was  also  aided  by  the  plan  by  which 
Negroes  chose  their  homes.  The  builder  and  his  consultant 
agreed  that  Negroes  should  be scattered  around  the  community 
(if  possible,  only  one  per  block),  and  that  under  no  circum-
stances  should  two  Negroes  be  permitted  to  buy  adjoining 
houses.  This  prevented  anyone  from  imagining  that  gro_ups  of 
Negroes  were  invading  the  community  or  that  a  Negro  subsec-
tion  might develop,  and  made  it  impossible  for  white  buyers  to 
ask  to be located in an all-white section,  thus facilitating the task 
of the sales force in implementing integration. 

Needless  to  say,  the  sales  force  was  briefed  intensively.  Every 
salesman  was  instructed  that,  "At no  time would  he,  directly,  or 
indirectly, raise  the issue of race;  that when questioned by a pros-
pect  he  would  react  without  evasion,  defense,  or  apology  but 
with  a  manner  that  suggested  to  the  questioner  that  the  matter 
was  not of  specific  concern  to  him  or  the  firm."  18  A  deliberate 
decision  not to attempt to convert  the salesmen  to a  personal  be-
lief  in  integration  and  a  two-week  research  program,  which 
showed  that  few  prospective  white  purchasers  brought  up  the 
race  issue,  seems  to  have  altered  the  behavior of  the  sales  force 
quickly and quietlyP 

Although  many  whites  were  willing  to  live  in  an  integrated 
Levittown,  some  were  hesitant  about  buying  next  to  a  Negro 
family.  To  overcome  this  problem,  the  Levitt  organization  de-
veloped an  ingenious system  for  choosing lots,  giving first  choice 
in each  neighborhood and  its  subsections  to  Negroes.  Like other 
purchasers,  they naturally preferred a private lot, one backing up 
on  woods,  creeks,  or  open  space  rather  than  on  other  houses. 
Consequently,  Negroes  automatically  located  themselves  at  the 
edge  of  neighborhoods,  where  they  would  be  adjacent  to  fewer 
white  purchasers  than  they would  have  been  in  the middle,  and 
where  they  might be less  visible  to  hostile  whites.  It also  forced 
whites who chose lots after them to decide whether they wanted a 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

private lot  next  to  a  Negro  family,  or a  less  desirable one  in all-
white  company. 18  If a  white  purchaser  chose  a  lot  adjacent  to 
one selected  by a  Negro  family,  he was  told so  and given  the op-
tion  of  changing  to  another  lot.  Most  white  buyers  preferred 
privacy with  Negro neighbors to interior lots, .and even when the 
few  "private"  lots  were  gone,  only  about  20  per  cent  who  had 
chosen  next  to  a  Negro  picked  another  lot. 10  As  a  result,  few 
houses adjacent to Negro-owned ones remained unsold. 20 

The large  majority of  Levittowners were  not affected  by these 
aspects  of  the  desegregation  process;  they  were  to  be  involved 
through  the  Human  Relations  Council,  which  made  plans  to 
publish  pamphlets,  visit  concerned  white  and  Negro  residents, 
and  hold  school  programs  and  community  workshops  on  in-
tegration.  Of  these,  only  the  workshop  materialized,  for  by  the 
time  the  Council  began  to  meet  regularly,  the  first  four  Negro 
families  had  moved  in without incident,  and Levitt felt  that  fur-
ther Council  activities  would  only draw  undue  publicity  toward 
the  presence  of  Negroes  in  Levittown.  The workshop  was  to  be 
attended  by  representatives  from  every  voluntary  association  in 
town,  but drew more from  those favoring  integration. The work-
shop  program  consisted  of  lectures  by  outside  name  experts, 
which  were  unsuccessful  because  they  assumed  the  Levittowners 
were prejudiced and demanded a change in attitude;  and of post-
lecture  "buzz  groups,"  which  were  quite  successful,  because 
people saw  their neighbors  had similar doubts about integration 
and were  thus able  to  talk  freely  about  the  problems  that really 
concerned  them-property values and intermarriage. The discus-
sions did not convert anyone  to  integration, but the provision of 
new facts in the right setting stilled some fears. 21 

The arrival  of  the first  Negro purchaser in June, just after the 
final  session  of  the  Workshop,  proceeded  quietly,  uneventfully, 
and almost unnoticed.  The family was  personally welcomed  by a 
Levitt  vice-president  and  even  by  the  Mayor  (but  without  pub-
licity).  A .brief  flurry  of  concern  arose  when  a  milk  salesman 
tried  to  organize  a  boycott  against  the  company serving the  Ne-
gro  family,  but a  call  from  the  Human  Relations Council  to  his 
employer  put  an  end  to  the  matter.  A  week  later,  some  pro-
integration  residents,  believing  that  in  the  other  Levittowns  no 
Negro  had  ever  dared  enter  the  pool,  made  elaborate  plans  to 
take the family swimming,  but this turned out to be unnecessary, 
for  the  day  before,  the  children  next  door  had  casually  taken 

Politics  and  Planning 

•  379  • 

their new neighbors with them to the pool. Other families moved 
in  equally  quietly,  and  by  the  time  the  fifth  one  had  arrived, 
even those who followed  integration closely no longer kept track 
of the newcomers.  As  of  1964,  the number of Negro families  was 
estimated at around 50,  more  than  in  the  two  other  Levittowns 
combined, but no one knew-or seemed to care-about the exact 
number. 

The  integration  of  Negro  residents  into  community life  also 
proceeded  without  incident,  although  slowly.  They  were  wel-
comed  as  church  members  in  their  own  denominations;  indi-
vidual Negroes became active in a  number of organizations, such 
as  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  the  Democratic  party,  but 
membership  in  more  explicitly  social  organizations  was  rarer. 
Neighbor  relationships  between  whites  and  Negroes  were  cor-
dial,  but  there  was  little  sociability across  racial  lines.  Only  Ne-
gro  cosmopolitans  found  the  relaxed  and  intensive  sociability 
that  spells  real  integration,  for  the  white  cosmopolitans,  them-
selves  an  isolated minority in  the community,  incorporated them 
into their organizational and social activities. 

Shortly after my  fieldwork  was  concluded  in  1961,  two  Negro 
families  purchased houses  in  one of the  all-white  neighborhoods 
settled before integration. The resales were made privately,  with-
out any  involvement  by  either  human  relations  agencies  or  real 
estate  brokers,  and  they  too  took  place  without  incident,  al-
though  not without  some  tension.  The real  estate agencies  were 
in  fact  the  only  group  to  discriminate  openly,  refusing  to  show 
houses  for  resale  to ·Negro buyers.  Competition between  brokers 
was  intense,  and  they  figured  that  whites  might  not  give  their 
house  for  sale  to  brokers  who  had  previously  sold  to  Negroes. 
And  they knew  that white customers would outnumber Negroes 
for  a  long  time  to  come.  Most  whites  who  got  along  well  with 
their neighbors were reluctant to sell  to Negroes if the neighbors 
opposed it, and giving the house to a real estate agency which did 
not  discriminate  might  a~ger  the  neighbors. 22  Some  Levit-
towners  were  not  yet  ready  to  live  next  door  to  a  Negro,  and 
others were afraid that  they would have difficulty selling a  house 
in  the  extremely  soft  resale  market  if  the  adjacent  house  was 
Negro-occupied.  The real  estate salesmen  therefore considered it 
good business to deal only with whites. 23 

All  things  considered,  the  desegregation  of  Levittown  turned 
out to be successful. True, only a  relative handful of Negroes did 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

buy.  The  vast  majority  could  not  afford  even  the  inexpensive 
Levitt  house,  and  some  of  those  who  could  were  not  yet  emo-
tionally  ready  to  move  into  what  was  still  a  99  per  cent  white 
community.  The county  Human  Relations  Council  always  had 
more  difficulty  in  finding  Negro  buyers  than  white  sellers.  The 
only  one  for  whom  integration  was  not  a  clear  success  was  the 
builder.  Even  before  integTation,  sales  had  begun  to  slow down, 
and  the  drop-off  continued  afterwards.  What  portion  of  the  re-
duction  resulted  from  integration  is  difficult  to  establish.  If one 
compares  the  number of  move-ins  just before  and after  integra-
tion,  there  is  no  indication  of  any  direct  and  immediate  rela-
tionship.24  Sales  did drop sharply in the  years  that followed,  but 
the drop occurred during a  period when the area housing market 
had  become  saturated  and  county  employment  had  been  re-
duced.25 

Although  Levitt  officials  felt  that  integration  had  made  it 
difhcult  to  attract  Philadelphians  who  were  themselves  escaping 
racial  change  in  the city,  and attributed  20  per cent of the sales 
decline  to  integration,  I  suspect  that  this  estimate  is  too  high.26 
Levitt's publicity policy did not help either, for  the Philadelphia 
area  was  never  told  that  integration  had  been  peaceful  and  had 
attracted  only  a  handful  of  middle  class  Negroes.  If would-be 
buyers  thought  Levittown was  overrun with  lower class  Negroes 
or  beset  by  racial  strife,  and  therefore  refrained  from  even  con-
sidering moving there, no one ever set them straight. 

In any case,  Levitt's  experience  with  New Jersey's  Fair  Hous-
ing  Law did not discourage  him from  building two  other subdi-
visions  in the  state,  both  integrated.  Conversely,  in  his  Bel  Air, 
Maryland, subdivision near Washington, D.C.,  Levitt announced 
from  the start  that  he would  go  along with local  "customs"  and 
would not sell  to  Negroes,  thus once again  inviting court action 
and demonstrations by local  pro-integration organizations.27 

Reasons for the Success of Desegregation 

Had  it  not  been  for  the  state  law  banning  discrimination  in 
government-supported housing developments and  the court's  in-
terpretation of FHA mortgage insurance as  a form of government 
support, Levittown might still  be an all-white community today. 
When  the  builder  decided  to  anticipate  the  court's  decision, 
however,  an  effective  decision-making  apparatus  for  implement-
ing  integration  was  quickly  established.  Moreover,  Levitt  used 

Politics  and  Planning 

•  381  • 

two  methods  for  which  he  had  previously  shown~ little  enthusi-
asm:  the employment of outside experts and deliberate planning, 
primarily  to  avoid  a  repetition  of  the  events  in  Levittown, 
Pennsylvania.  In  many  ways,  then,  the  successful  integration  of 
Levittown,  New  Jersey,  was  a  direct  consequence  of  the  racial 
conflict and ensuing publicity in the older Levittown. 

Major  credit  must  be  given  to  the  consultant,  however,  and 
particularly  to his  approach.  He did not attempt  to change com-
munity attitudes,  but systematically confronted the major partic-
ipants in  the  process  (as  well  as  possible  sources  of conflict),  and 
persuaded them to adopt behavior  patterns that would assure  the 
success  of  the venture,  yet  without  requiring  them  to  surrender 
their own major goals.  Writing about an orientation session with 
the Levitt sales staff, he described his approach as follows: 

[It was]  designed  to accomplish  two  principal  missions:  (1) 
to  obtain  through  discussion  some  measure  of  the  respon-
siveness  of  this  highly  influential  group  of opinion-makers 
to  the  new  policy,  and  (2)  to  enable  the  consultants  to 
present  the  inevitable  situation  which  conditions  and  the 
law  imposed.  There was  no  hope of converting  those  hold-
ing negative  views.  The session  was geared  to  reinforce  the 
official  position of the employing firm with fact and research 
findings, and information as  to the legal aspects of their own 
acts as agents of a building firm. 2s 

Aware that order was  the goal of highest priority, he developed 
a  consensus  among  the relevant community officials  and  leaders, 
and  communicated  it  to  the  residents.  The  mechanism  was  a 
new,  short-term institution devoted solely  to  the implementation 
of integration, made up of existing community institutions which 
were  in  turn  in  contact  with  many  residents.  This  new  institu-
tion had both an actual component-sets of instructions and pres-
sures placed on participants to conform to the integration plan-
and  a  performing  component,  the  Human  Relations ·council,· 
which  sought  to  demonstrate  that  most  Levittowners  were  not 
opposed  to  integration.  In  peopling  this  institution,  the  consul-
tant  provided  positive  roles  for  those  willing  to  participate and 
gave  the  unwilling an  opportunity  to  stay  on  the  sidelines.  The 
ministers were able  to develop a  united front  for  their churches, 
the  police  chief  got  a  chance  to  demonstrate  his  department's 
professionalism,  and  the  politicians  were  allowed  to  stay  out  to 
prevent the issue  from  hurting them politically. Finally,  the con-

•  382  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

sultant  was  able  to  persuade  a  community  most  of  whose  resi-
dents were opposed to integration  to accept  it without visible re-
action.  The ministers added a  moral  imperative  to  the legal  im-
perative  supplied  by  the  law,  making  it  difficult  for  anyone  to 
come  out  publicly  against  integration.  Opposition  was  thus  re-
stricted  to private grumbling,  and  it was  dissipated  between  the 
time  integration  was  announced  and  the  first  Negro  family  ar-
rived. 

Even  so,  desegregation  might  not  have  proceeded  so  smoothly 
had it not been for  the willingness of Levittowners to cooperate. 
Five factors were responsible:  the legal  imperative, the absence of 
status  threat,  the class  level  of both white and Negro purchasers, 
the physical layout of the community, and  its newness.  Undoubt-
edly,  the  court decision  set  the  stage  for  a  positive  climate,  and 
so  did  Levitt's  decision  to  integrate  "voluntarily"  after previous 
vigorous  opposition.  Levittowners  realized,  I  think,  that  Levitt 
stood  to  lose  many  white  sales,  and  felt  that  if  he  nevertheless 
went along voluntarily they had  no good reason  to do otherwise. 
Still,  they  might  have  objected  to  the  possible  loss  of commu-
nity  status.  Of  course,  only  the  new  neighborhoods  were  in-
volved,  but even  so,  everyone  knew  that from  now  on,  the  out-
side world would consider the entire community  integrated.  But 
the  arrival  of  Negroes  was  not  interpreted  as  a  major  status 
threat, principally because Levittown was--and would remain-a 
predominantly middle  class  town.  Higher-status  people  had  not 
yet begun to leave,  and the fears  of property value and status de-
cline that threatened working class people in Levittown, Pennsyl-
vania,  and  contributed  to  its  racial  disturbance  were  not  pres-
ent.29  Even  though  residential  turnover  and  tax  problems  were 
serious enough  to frighten  both working class  and lower middle 
class residents,  they did not panic. Many knew that racial conflict 
might well  begin to reduce Levittown's  prestige,  and even  those 
who  opposed  integration  often  said  that  it  was  preferable  to  a 
riot.  If they had felt  really  threatened, however,  these  considera-
tions would have been ignored in the heat of panic. 

One reason people did not panic can be found in their own so-
cioeconomic  position  and  in  their  expectation  that  the  Negro 
newcomers would share it.  Research on prejudice and racial  con-
flict  has  demonstrated  that  these  are  less  intense at  higher socio-
economic  levels,  and  the  white  New  Jersey  Levittowners  were 
more  affluent  than  the  Pennsylvanians.  The  Negroes  who  came 

Politics  and  Planning 

•  s83  • 

were  clearly  and  visibly  middle  class  people,  with  more  educa-
tion,  better  jobs,  and  higher  family  incomes  than  most  whites, 
but the white  Levittowners  did not  know  this  in advance.  Even 
so,  most were convinced that poor Negroes could not buy in their 
community and  that the builder would not admit slum dwellers. 
Although the belief that only a  few atypical Negroes could afford 
Levittown  was  a  way  of  reassuring  oneself  of  the  community's 
high status,  the  fact  that  people  were convinced  of  this without 
data  to  back  up  their  feelings  suggests  again  the  lack  of intense 
status fears. 

The physical  layout of Levittown into separate neighborhoods 
made  it  possible  for  segregationists  in  the  existing  ones  to  feel 
secure in the knowledge that their own areas were still  white, and 
that  the  Negroes  were  geographically  and  socially  far  away. 30 
The  mixture  of  house  types  on  the  block  scattered  low-income 
residents  throughout  the  community, and segregationists among 
them, living amid people who favored  integration or order above 
all,  probably never  knew  how  many others shared  their  feelings 
and  were  willing  to  act on  them.  In  the  older  Levittown,  one-
price  neighborhoods concentrated such  people and  made  it easy 
for  them  to get together with like-minded neighbors. One Levit-
towner who had lived in the Pennsylvania community during the 
disturbance  described  her  block  there  as  "very  negative;  nice 
neighbors became ugly,  took their kids evenings and went over to 
the (Negro] house to throw stones." 

Finally,  the  success  of  integration  must  be  traced  also  to  the 
community's newness.  Levittown, Pennsylvania had been in exis-
tence  for  six  years  when  the  first  Negro  arrived,  but  the  New 
Jersey  community  had  only  been  established  for  two,  another 
reason  why  status  decline  had  not  yet  begun.  The desire  to  be 
law-abiding, orderly, and idealistic was  typical  of a  new commu-
nity, and so was  the police department's desire  to be the best in 
the county. The politicians' reluctance to participate in the inte-
gration process can  be attributed to newness as  well, for  they did 
not yet know their constituents well enough to take a  stand. Had 
they been aware of a  significant bloc of anti-integration opinion, 
one  of them  might  have  been  tempted  to  exploit  it for  political 
benefit.  And  the  newness  of  the  neighborhood  into  which  the 
first  Negroes  moved made  it  impossible for  segregationists  to re-
cruit their neighbors for opposition.  In an already settled neigh-
borhood,  they  would  have  known  similarly  inclined  residents. 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

In fact,  the positive  role  of  the community's newness raises the 
question  whether  integration should not have  been instituted at 
the  very  start.  Pro-integration  groups  in  the  Philadelphia  area 
had urged this step on the builder, and if it had been taken, there 
would have been no need for advance  planning to  prevent a  dis-
turbance.  Moreover,  the housing market was  healthier then, and 
the Levitt house a  better bargain in 1958  than in  1960. Although 
the  builder would  have  lost  some  sales  among  militant  segrega-
tionists,  most  of  them  would  really  not  have  had  an  alternative 
source  of  new,  low-priced  homes.  Moreover,  voluntary  integra-
tion  would  have  avoided  a  court  case,  saved  legal  costs  for  the 
builder, and brought a  number of symbolic rewards-and favor-
able  national  publicity-for  a  progressive  and  courageous  act. 
There are,  however,  some good arguments against  initial  inte-
gration.  When  Levittown  was  first  occupied,  the  state  law  had 
not  yet  been  tested  in  the  courts,  and  the  legal  imperative  was 
still  lacking.  Consequently,  antagonistic  Levittowners  who  later 
wished  to  be  law-abiding  might  have  been  less  reluctant  about 
acting out their prejudices.  Organizations badly  in need of mem-
bers  might  have  turned  away  Negroes  for  fear  of scaring off  po-
tential white members, and the politicians,  then  terribly short of 
issues,  might  have  made  one  out  of  integration.  Since  neither 
Levitt  nor  community  leaders  would  have  known  the  commu-
nity, it would probably have been impossible to plan against such 
occurrences,  and  without  the  positive  community climate,  inter-
ested  Negro  buyers,  not knowing what they would face  in Levit-
town,  might  have  been  discouraged from  coming.31 

Comparing  the  benefits  and  costs  of  initial  and  later  integra-
tion is  difficult,  but I  suspect  that in the absence of legal  inevita-
bility in  1958, opening the community to Negroes from  the start 
would have been more problematic. This conclusion applies only 
to Levittown;  other communities might well  benefit from  initial 
integration.  Even  so,  the  choice  between  the  two  alternatives  is 
less  important  than  the  fact  that  even  after  Levittown  was 
opened to  Negroes, only a  handful came.  Results of successful  in-
tegration experiences ought to be  better publicized so  that other 
comJT •Jnities can use  them  to plan, and so  that Negroes who are 
justifiably  concerned  about  the  hardships  of  moving  into  an 
overwhelmingly  white community can  learn  that  they  have  less 
to fear than they think. But the main problem is  to do away with 
the economic inequities that now prevent so  many Negroes from 
affording suburban homes or decent shelter of any kind.

THE QUALITY  OF COMMUNITY PLANNING 

The activities of the community's Planning Board and its profes· 
sional consultant provide a  less  happy illustration of nonpolitical 
decision-making. As  I  noted in Chapter One, the Planning Board 
had  been  set  up  before  Levitt  purchased  land,  and  it,  together 
with  its  consultant,  cooperated  fully  with  Levitt's  efforts  and 
plans.  Once  the community was  occupied,  the old residents  who 
served  as  board  members  were  replaced  by  newcomers-party 
workers  who  were  being  rewarded  for  their  campaign  contribu-
tions  and  engineers  and  real  estate  salesmen  who  had  (or  were 
thought  to  have)  some  expertise on planning matters.  Like  most 
other municipal  agencies,  the  Planning Board  initiated  little  ac-
tivity  of  its  own,  but responded  to  requests  that  came  before  it, 
most  of  which  were  for  approval  of  small  shopping  centers  on 
land  not  owned  by  Levitt.  For  example,  from  January  1g6o  to 
May  1961,  46  per cent of  the  items on  the  board's calendar fell 
into  this category. and another  15  per cent dealt with  the proper 
size  of signs for  stores and  gas  stations.  Only  11  per  cent  of  the 
agenda  dealt  with  more  general  planning  topics,  the  major  one 
concerning the number of gas  stations  to  be permitted in Levit-
town. 

Since  the  board  members  knew  little  about  planning,  they 
usually gave  the consultant free  rein to propose what he thought 
best,  adopting  his  recommendations  as  their  own  except  when 
they  became  controversial.  The consultant's  main  function  was 
to check shopping center plans to make sure that they were in ac-
cord with  municipal  ordinances,  had  enough ·parking space,  and 
were designed  for  efficient  traffic  circulation.  He  also  advocated 
changes  in  the  community's  planning  ordinances,  among  them 
that stores and gas stations should be built in Colonial style so  as 
to coincide with the design  of the houses and that signs by which 
stores advertised  their presence  should  be limited  in size.82  Both 
proposals  were  bitterly  fought  by  the  applicants  for  sites,  espe-
cially by chains which wanted the same  elevations and signs  they 
built  elsewhere  in  the  nation,  but  eventually  they  went  along 
with the board because they had no other choice. 

The builder and the Planning Board supported the consultant 
because  they agreed  that  the  community  should  be  esthetically 
pleasing  and  that  this  could  be  achieved  by  architectural  har-
mony of the kind he proposed. The residents were primarily con-

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

cerned with status protection and wanted to make sure that com-
mercial  establishments  did  not  infiltrate  residential  areas.  In-
deed,  their  concern  for  protection-also  shared  by  most  of  the 
board members-was strong enough that sometimes the Planning 
Board went beyond what the planner had proposed.  When some 
residents  objected  to  the  number of gas  stations  being  built  in 
the  community,  the  planner  was  asked  to  write  an  ordinance 
limiting  them,  and  the  Planning  Board  was  able  to  persuade 
Levitt  to  put just one gas  station  on any  intersection  he owned. 
The consultant was  overruled only when  his  proposals generated 
political  opposition,  for  example,  his  recommendation  to  let  all 
nonresident  doctors  purchase  homes  for  offices  and  his  rejection 
of a  variance request by  the powerful VFW to build a clubhouse 
near a residential area. 

One of  the  planner's  most  important duties was  to  prepare a 
community  master  plan  to  regulate  future  growth.  Since  there 
was  little  community  interest  in  a  master  plan,  and  not  many 
people knew what ought to go into it, he had considerable leeway 
to  make-or at  least  propose--decisions  about  the  community's 
future.  Of course,  he  was  limited  by  the  small  budget allocated 
for -township  planning,  by the builder's role  in the community's 
future,  and  by  his  own  decision  to  coordinate  his  master  plan-
ning  with  the  builder's.  As  I  indicated  in  Chapter  One,  the 
planner's sympathies  were  more  with  Levitt  than  with  the  resi-
dents.  He believed fervently  in what he defined  to be good plan-
ning,  saw  his role as  "trying to  teach good  planning to  the Plan-
ning  Board  and  the  Levitt  Company,"  and  felt  that  "the  best 
kind of planning was  that which also  made good business sense." 
His  planning  philosophy  and  his  judgment of  where  the  power 
lay dictated that he work closely with the builder in planning for 
the  township,  and  that  he  adapt  his  recommendations  to  the 
builder's proposals.  As  a  result,  the preliminary plan, completed 
in  1959,  coincided closely with Levitt's own scheme.  Both it and 
the  final  plan,  published  in  1964,  proposed  and  located  future 
community facilities  ranging from  schools  to shopping areas and 
utility  systems,  suggested  some  revisions  in  the  design  of  resi-
dential  areas,  and  advocated  improvements  in  some  municipal 
services. 

The final  plan deserves detailed examination as a  case of poor 
nonpolitical decision-making.  It ran to  two volumes,  but one was 
taken  up  with  "basic  studies"  of  the  community  which  told 

Politics  and  Planning 

Levittowners  little  they  did  not  know  already. 33  The  second 
volume was  devoted  to a  "Suggested Development Plan," and  in 
accordance  with  contemporary  planning  thought,  proposed  a 
number  of  "community  objectives"  and  policy  proposals  to 
achieve them. Community objectives are of great significance, and 
one would need to know how they were determined. If they were 
really  community  objectives,  the  planner  should  have  inter-
viewed a  sample  of citizens,  or  if  lack  of funds  made  this  impos-
sible,  at  least  the political  leaders.  The  report does  not  indicate 
how  the planner determined them, and states only, "the develop-
ment  plan  has  formulated  objectives  which  all  citizens  and 
officials  should  strive  to  achieve." 84  Since  the  planner  gathered 
most  of his  information about  Levittown  from  the  U.S.  Census, 
he  could  not  have  learned  the  objectives  from  the  community. 
Judging  by  their  content,  some  came  from  the  decision-makers, 
some  from  the  builder,  but  the  majority  were  his  own. 3~  Ac-
tually, most were such general and vague statements that one sus-
pects  no  analysis  of any  kind  went  into  their  formulation.  As  a 
result,  the objectives were  not ranked  in any order of priority to 
indicate which were of most urgency, and, of course, they paid no 
attention  to  the  community's  diversity,  thus  giving  residents  no 
opportunity  to  debate  alternatives.  Since  their  generality  made 
them virtually useless  for  planning purposes,  the  main weight of 
the plan fell  on  the policy proposals, but these also seemed bereft 
of  analysis  and  bore  no  logical  or  empirical  relationship  to  the 
objectives  they  were· supposed  to  achieve.  If they  were  intended 
as means to community goals, the plan providoo no evidence  that 
they could or would realize these goals. 

These deficiencies  can  be  illustrated  by an  analysis of some of 
the  plan's  ten  objectives  and  the  relevant  policy  recommenda-
tions:  86 

Objective  1:  Achieve  an  environment  for  the  people  of 
Willingboro  by  providing  for  the  human  ac-
tivities  of work,  leisure,  play,  rest,  education, 
religion  and  esthetic  fulfillment. 

This statement,  although  typically  found  in  planning reports,  is 
so  general  as  to  be  meaningless.  It  fails  to  define  an  "environ-
ment," or  to indicate  what kinds of work,  leisure,  play,  etc.,  are 
wanted  by  various  sectors  of  the  population  and  which  are  de-
sirable by other criteria. 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

The plan's policies  for  achievement of this  objective deal  with 
only  a  few  "human  activities."  Leisure  needs  are  to  be  met  by 
township  parks,  playgrounds,  playfields,  tot-lots,  walking areas,  a 
marina,  and  a  golf  course.  However  desirable,  these  offer  only 
athletic  outdoor  recreation,  principally  for  children  (especially 
boys),  for  men,  and  for  families  affluent  enough  to  own  a  boat. 
No  provision  is  made  for  nonathletic  forms  of  leisure,  such  as 
commercial  entertainment, and nothing is  said  about facilitating 
sociability and  reducing the  social  isolation  which  I  reported on 
in  earlier  chapters.  Also,  there  is  no  plan  for  the  needs  of  teen-
agers,  other  than  to  suggest  a  "Teenage  Center"  as  part  of  the 
public  library,  to  be  located  near  the  senior  high  school.  A 
moment's  observation  is  enough  to  show  that  adolescents would 
look skeptically on a center located in the library-an institution 
that demands  quiet  from  its  users,  or one sited  next  to  the  high 
school-an  institution  that  discourages  precisely  the  kind  of 
recreation  teenagers want.  Moreover,  the  plan  is  silent about the 
activities  of  the  center,  whether  it  would  be  run  by  teenage  or 
adult  rules  or  what  it  would  do  to  give  teenagers  a  function  in 
the community. 

Esthetic  fulfillment  is  to  be  provided  through  the  establish-
ment  of  parks  and  the  preservation  of  "natural  features"  of  the 
original  rural  landscape.  The  plan  offers  no  evidence  for  (or 
against)  the  assumption  that  a  significant  number  of  people  de-
rive  esthetic  pleasure  from  looking at  or  being in  parks,  and  no 
provision is  made for other forms  of esthetic  pleasure-seeking,  be 
they museums or movies.  The plan argues  that "the park should 
be designed to give  the residents an opportunity to get away from 
the  noise  and  rush  of  traffic  and  enjoy contact  with  nature  once 
again." 37  It offers  no  data,  however,  that  Levittowners  want  to 
escape  from  local  noise  and  traffic  (which  were,  of  course, 
minimal),  that  they  want  to  enjoy  contact  with  nature,  or  that 
they prefer  to do this in  a  park rather  than in  their own gardens 
or at a beach. 

Planning  for  education  is  limited  to  listing  the  number  of 
needed  schools,  suggesting  their  acreage,  and  locating  them  on 
specific  sites  on  the  "Development  Plan  Map."  There  is  no  dis-
cussion  of  what  kinds  of  education  are  wanted  by  the  residents 
(or  even  by  the  planner),  or why  the elementary school  needs  to 
be  15  to  20 acres,  and  the senior high school  40  to 50.  Such acre-
ages  may  be  desirable  and  necessary,  but  the community  might 

Politics  and  Planning 

also  want  to  spend  scarce  funds  on  other  educational  objec-
tives. 

Planning  for  work  is  touched  on  only  in  a  brief  statement 
about industrial  facilities  that reads:  "The present  nature of  the 
township would seem  to dictate that any industry in 'Willingboro 
should be of the quiet  type,  . . .  research  and development lab-
oratories  and  administrative  offices,  light  manufacturing  pro-
cesses  and  warehousing  and  storage." 38  The  plan  says  nothing 
about whether Levittowners want to work in  their own  commu-
nity or not, and if so,  what kinds of work they would like to have 
or are  qualified  for,  and  whether  it could  be  provided  in  Levit-
town. 

Objective  2:  Establish  local  commercial  shopping  center 
sites  in  the  Township  and  at  the  same  time 
set  a  policy  which  discourages  strip  commer-
cial  development  off  Route  U.S.  130. 

This objective  is  a  policy  statement which  does  not refer  to  any 
broader  goal,  but  reflects  the  planning  consultant's  intense  dis-
like of strip shopping.  It is  clearly  his  own  goal,  and  although a 
shopping center may well  be preferable to stores strung along the 
highway,  there is  no evidence either in his report or in my obser-
vations  that Levitlowners were very  much concerned about what 
kinds  of  stores  they  shopped  in. 3G  If they  had  shopping  goals  of 
their  own,  these  probably  had  to  do  with  low  prices,  and  the 
availability, accessibility, and variety of stores. 

Objective  4:  Provide  the foundation  for  a  sound and func-

tional  municipal  service  program. 

This  objective  is  meaningless  unless  the  terms  "sound"  and 
"functional"  are  defined.  Policies  related  to  the  statement  are 
limited to a suggestion  that water and sewer facilities are in good 
order,  that more policemen and a  second  fire  station are needed, 
that  the  public  works  department  requires  more  storage  space, 
and that a  township medical building (the functions of which are 
not  specified)  ought  to  be  attached  to  the  existing  hospital. 
Nothing is  said about what kinds of new services  the community 
wants  or  should  have,  or  how  existing  services  might  be  im-
proved.  For  example,  the  expansion  of  the  police  force  is  pro-
posed  without  questioning  whether  the  town's  crime  rate  or 
traffic  problems  justify  it.  Similarly,  nothing  is  said  about  the 

kinds of medical services residents want and need, about counsel-
ing  and  mental  health  facilities,  or about  how  to  pay  for  them. 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

Objective  8:  Develop  a  program  to  help  balance  existing 
and  future  residential  development  with  ap-
propriate  ratables  that  will:  provide  lands 
for  future  industrial  and  commercial  expan-
sion,  offer  recommendations  for  future  con-
trol  of  highway  development  off  U.S.  Route 
130,  provide  sites  for  local  planned shopping 
centers,  establish  certain  remaining  tracts  for 
a  lower density pattern of residential develop-
ment. 

This objective is  deficient on several  grounds.  It is  unclear,  mak-
ing it impossible  to  tell  whether the primary aim  is  to  "balance" 
existing and  future  residential  development  or  to solve  the  tax 
problems of the community.  Moreover,  no evidence is  given  that 
providing land for  commerce and  industry and doing away  with 
strip  shopping  will  create  either  "balance"  or  "appropriate" 
ratables.  Nothing is  said about the community's unwillingness to 
pay higher property taxes or about feasible  alternative sources  of 
public funds,  given  the likelihood that sufficient  industry cannot 
be attracted  to  Levittown.  In  fact,  the  plan  does  not  concern  it-
self with the tax problem at all,  except to  provide a detailed anal-
ysis  of current sources of municipal  income and expenditure pat-
terns and to point out repeatedly that "the only recourse available 
to lessen  the burden of the individual  taxpayer is  the addition of 
profitable  ratables  to  the  Township's  tax  base." 40  The  Sug-
gested  Development Plan does  not  even  raise  the  tax  base  issue, 
and  does  not  suggest  how  Levittown  can  solve  its  financial  di-
lemma. 

Admittedly, one should not expect the planner to solve  the in-
soluble,  but  then  he  should  have  indicated  that  no  solution 
existed and that Levittown  could choose  to  increase  the tax  rate 
further,  keep  it at  its  present  level  and  restrict  future  expendi-
tures  accordingly,  or  lobby  for  state  and  federal  subsidies.  The 
planner  should  also  have  estimated  the  costs  of  his  various  pro-
posals  and,  since  Levittowners  object  to  higher  taxes,  indicated 
which  were  of greater  urgency  than  others  in  case  not all  could 
be  financed.  Instead,  the  report  concludes  hopefully:  "In  short, 
the  Planning  Board  realizes  that  it  cannot  wave  a  magic  wand 
and make new industry flock  to Willingboro, but that honest and

steady work by the Planning Board,  the  Industrial  Development 
Committee, Town Council, and the public will  result in substan-
tial gains  for  the Township." 41 

Despite  the  community's  great concern  over  taxes,  the  actual 
plan  is  most  detailed  about  policies  for  future  residential  de-
velopment.  In  describing these  policies,  the  planner adds  a  new 
objective,  for  he suggests:  "A prime objective of the Township's 
development plan is  not only the recognition of continued devel-
opment of single-family  houses  but to recommend a  wider diver-
sification  of  future  residential  lots  and  dwelling  types  that  will 
accommodate  a  possible  so,ooo  people." 42  No  reason  is  given 
why  such  diversification  is  desirable,  or  why  the  town  should 
eventually  have  a  population  of  50,000.43  The  policies  them-
selves  call  for  the  construction  of  houses  on  larger  lots,  which 
presumably  means  more  expensive  houses  as  well,  although  this 
is  not stated.  There is  no discussion  of whether Levittown could 
attract  high-income  residents,  a  particularly  important  omission 
since  Levitt has  so  far  been  unable  to  do so.  Nor is  there any in-
dication of the virtue of such an approach or of whether it would 
help provide significant additional tax revenues. 

Instead of  dealing  with such  questions,  the  plan proposes  that 
many  of  the  future  houses  be  sited  in  "cluster  subdivisions,"  a 
series  of cui-de-sacs  surrounded  by  public  open  space,  instead  of 
in  "conventional"  subdivisions  of  houses  placed  side  by  side  on 
curving  streets.  The  planner's  argument  for  this  innovation,  a 
current fad  in site planning, sometimes borders on  the  ludicrous. 
It indicates  that  conventional  subdivisions  create  urban  sprawl, 
"provide  row  upon  row  of  stereotyped  houses,  many  with  un-
sightly and  unkept  yards  . . .  and  utility  poles  weave  a  tangled 
web  of  wires." 44  The  cluster,  on  the  other  hand,  ''helps  reduce 
the  dangerous  intersections  and  streets  found  in  conventional 
subdivisions,  [is]  uncluttered  with  overhead  utility  wires,  [pro-
vides]  greater variety of house styles,  nearby open space, and pre-
vents children from  playing in the streets." 45 

The  plan  offers  no  evidence  for  these  statements.  In  actual 
fact,  urban sprawl  is caused by speculative land acquisition which 
often leaves vacant and unbuildable spaces  between subdivisions, 
but has  nothing  to do  with  the  site  planning of specific  subdivi-
sions.  Moreover,  there  is  no  reason  why  houses  need  be  stereo-
types  in  the conventional  subdivision or more varied  in  the clus-
ter style;  this  is  a  function  of builders'  practices and  house  price 

•  392  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

decisions.  Unsightly yards can exist in any site plan, and whether 
utility  poles  are  located  above  or  below  ground  is  a  function  of 
cost  (and  house  price) and not of the site plan.  Also, no evidence 
is  offered  that either plan will  prevent children  from  playing on 
the  streets  (they  actually  play  mainly  on  the  sidewalk  and  very 
little  on  the  grass)  or  that  the  conventional  subdivision  has 
created  traffic  accidents and danger  to children,  at least  in  Levit-
town.  Finally,  there is  no evidence  that buyers want more public 
open  space  or  are  willing  to  pay  the  taxes  to  have  it  main-
tained. 

Whether or not the cluster plan is superior to the conventional 
one  is  not at issue  here;  what  matters  is  that  the  planner is  pro-
posing a  scheme  requiring  more  expensive  houses  without  com-
menting  on  either  their  feasibility  or  desirability.  1\loreover,  if 
industry  is  to  be  attracted,  it  might  be  argued  that  Levittown 
should  provide  less  expensive  houses so  that workers  in  these  in-
dustries  can  live  there,  especially  since  a  firm's  location decision 
today  often  hinges  on  the  provision  of  housing  and  other  facil-
ities for its workers. 

Objective  10:  Develop  a  plan  for  the  health,  safety  and 
general  welfare of  all  the  people  of Willing-
boro that promotes good civic design,  stresses 
the efficient expenditure of public funds and 
recommends  provision  of  necessary  public 
services  and  facilities  for  the  future. 

This  final  objective  illustrates  the  deficiencies  of  the  plan  as  a 
who:e.  Despite  its  claims,  the  plan  has  not concerned  itself with 
the  health  and  safety  of  all  the  people,  nor  has  it  sought  to  de-
termine  their  welfare,  i.e.,  their  goals  and  problems.  Instead,  it 
has  accepted  some  of  the  builders'  and  the  municipal  agencies' 
demands,  and combined  them with  standard  planning proposals 
(such  as  large  acreages  for  schools)  and  with  current  site-plan-
ning fashions,  which  are  equated  with  "good  civic  design."  The 
plan does recommend public services and facilities,  but its defini-
tion  of  "necessary  services"  is  based  on  the  growth  demands  of 
various  municipal agencies,  and  not  on what Levittowners  need, 
want, or are willing  to  pay for.  Also,  no evidence is given for  the 
claim  that  the  plan  achieves  the  aim  of  efficient  expenditure  of 
public funds.  It fails  to define efficiency or to identify the goals in 
relation  to  which  efficiency  is  to  be  determined  and  neglects  to 

Politics .and  Planning 

offer alternative schemes which might be more efficient in achiev-
ing  even  the  goals  that  the  planner  has  set  for  the  community. 
For  example,  if  the  plan  wants  to  maximize  the  welfare  and 
safety  of  the  community,  it  would  be  more  efficient  and  more 
welfare-oriented to provide for  the needs of the teenagers beyond 
an obviously inadequate Teenage Center than to increase the size 
of the police force. 

The plan's lack  of interest  in  the citizens'  objectives was  com-
pounded  by  the  planner's  failure  to  pay  attention  to  citizens' 
opinions.  He spent little time in  the community, and judging by 
his  occasional  appearances  at  public  hearings,  made  no  effort  to 
understand them.  He  first  made  people unhappy  when  he failed 
to question the location of a gas station immediately adjacent to a 
church. At a hearing on  the preliminary plan, he antagonized  his 
audience by  his  unwillingness  to  discuss  the  bases  for  his  recom-
mendations,  justifying a  particularly controversial  one  by  asking 
people  to  accept  "thirteen  years  of  experience  and  long  discus-
sions  with  the  Planning  Board"  instead.  Following  a  public 
meeting on  the final  plan, a  local columnist  took  him to  task  for 
blithely  jumping to  conclusions  about  controversial  community 
issues,  such  as  the  then  bitterly  fought  garden  apartment  ordi-
nance.  In  a  caustic  column  which  also  questioned  his  presenta-
tion of obvious  facts  in  the guise  of  technical  jargon  and  his  re-
liance on outdated  census  statistics,  she  reported  him  as  saying: 

A community of young children requires "increased schools, 
police,  fire  protection,  recreation  and garbage  disposal"  [in 
THAT order?].  He then added that a  higher tax levy would 
be  required.  [There  were  only  seven  in  the  audience  and 
nobody  stood  up  and  cheered.]  Just  after  that  I  caught  a 
phrase  pregnant  with  meaning  . . .  "more  intensive  resi-
dential  use."  Is  this  a  sophisticated  way  of  saying  apart-
ments? 46 

The  planner  often  appealed  for  popular  support  of  planning 
through  "citizen  participation,"  but  he  gave  people  no  oppor-
tunity  to  participate,  and  his  actions  indicated  that  he  only 
wanted  their  assent  to  his  proposals.  In  fact,  Levittowners  who 
wanted  to  talk  with  him  found  it difficult  to  see  him,  and  when 
they succeeded,  he was  insensitive  to their concerns.  He failed  to 
explain  his  close working relatiomhip with  the builder and  took 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

little  interest  in  zoning  issues.  He  never  quite  understood  peo-
ple's  status  fears,  and  could  not  fathom  why  some  objected  to 
nonresident doctors, clubhouses, or gas stations, and why they did 
not  embrace  his  vendetta  against  strip  shopping  and  hot  dog 
stands.  And  he  was  totally  unaware  of  the  living  patterns,  the 
problems  of  social  and  physical  isolation,  and  the  community-
related worries  which  I  described in earlier chapters.  His  inabil-
ity  to comprehend even  the  Levittowners' occupational and class 
level  is  underscored  by  a  sentence  in  the  planning report  which 
suggests  that,  "Results  [in  attracting  new  industry]  are  also  ob-
tained  when  the residents  of  the  community  . . .  in  their daily 
contacts  with  businessmen,  industrialists,  and  investors  make 
their  community  interests  known." 47  I  doubt  whether  even 
William  Levitt  himself  had  such  daily  contacts,  but  then  the 
planner was  interested in land  use,  not  people;  in  efficiency  and 
"balance,"  not  in  people's demands and needs;  in site  plans and 
community facilities, not in how people live. 

As  a  result,  the community gave  him little support.  Of course, 
uninformed about  planning,  people could  perhaps  not  have  dis-
tinguished  between good and bad master plans.  But the planning 
they received all  dealt either with future community facilities,  of 
interest only to  later arrivals, or with vague generalizations about 
the community's problems, which they could not get the  planner 
to  discuss  openly.  Admittedly,  long-range  planning rarely  inter-
ests  many  people,  but  when  the  planner  ignores  their  present 
problems,  it  is  not  surprising  that  they  care  little  about  long-
Tange  ones.  And  when  the  planner  is  not  trusted  by  the  com-
munity,  he  loses  the support  of even  the cosmopolitans,  who are 
usually the most enthusiastic advocates of  planning. 

The  planner's  approach  and  his  master  plan  are  not  unique; 
the  Suggested  Development  Plan  is  quite  typical  of  those  pre-
pared  for  small  (and  even  large)  communities all  over  the coun-
try,  and  the  lack  of  contact  with  the citizens  and  the  concentra-
tion  on  future  physical  development are common as  well.  So  are 
the undue reliance on census data,  the concern with  professional 
objectives,  the  proposal  of policies  which are  professionally fash-
ionable but bear no logical or empirical relation to the objectives 
they  are  supposed  to  achieve,  the failure  to  provide  evidence for 
crucial  points  in  the  argument,  and  the  sloppy  methods  of anal-
ysis  and  synthesis  which  go  into  the  policy  proposals.48  It is  no 
wonder,  then,  that  planning  remains  a  poorly  budgeted  munic-

ipal  activity,  thought  to  be  of  little  relevance  to  the  real  prob-
lems of the community. 

LOCAL  DEMOCRACY  AND  CENTRAL  PLANNING 

The success of desegregation and even  the failure of master plan-
ning demonstrate that nonpolitical decision-making-or, to call  it 
by  its  rightful  name,  planning-can  be  implemented  in  a  local 
community when  properly  handled.  Of course,  it  is  not  entirely 
fair  to  compare  the  two  processes,  for  the  planner  had  a  much 
more  complex  assignment.  The  integration  consultant  had  to 
deal with a  single issue;  the decision  that generated  the plan  had 
already  been  made,  and  the  power  of  the  state  and  the  builder 
stood  behind  it.  The  planner,  on  the  other  hand,  had  to  deter-
mine community objectives on a  variety of issues,  make decisions 
about them, and use what little power the Planning Board had or 
could  give  to  demand  their  implementation-and  all  this  with 
probably less money than was spent for integration. 

Even  so,  the  fact  remains  that  the  integration  consultant 
planned well and the master planner did not. The former evoked 
the  latent community consensus  for  order,  used  it  by organiz·ing 
optimum  communication  between  community  leaders  and  resi-
dents, kept the issue out of the political arena, developed rational 
policies  which  were  logically  related  to  the  goals  he sought,  and 
implemented  them  by  demanding behavior  rather  than  attitude 
change and  by  maximizing  benefits  and  minimizing costs  for  all 
participants wherever  possible.  The master  planner did just  the 
opposite.  He  made  no  attempt  to  look  for  consensus  and  kept 
communication  with  residents  to  a  minimum.  Although  he  saw 
his role as  nonpolitical, he could neither keep major issues out of 
the  political  arena  nor  restrain  himself  from  judgments  about 
controversial  ones.  His  policies  were  irrational,  and  they  asked 
attitude as  well  as  behavior changes  from  people,  requiring their 
conversion  to  his  vision  of  the  community  without  taking  their 
demands  or  needs  into  account.  If benefits  and  costs  had  been 
computed,  the  former  would clearly accrue  to  the  planner (inso-
far  as  the  plan  realized  the  kind  of  community  he  wanted)  and 
the  latter would  be  borne  by  the  residents  who  would  be  both 
paying for  the changes  he  proposed  and altering  their life  styles 
to fit  the plan. 

Successful  planning requires  at  least  six  ingredients:  (1)  suffi-

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

cient  local  consensus or outside power to  initiate  the  process;  (2) 
an expert who has  the resources,  skills,  and information  to deter-
mine  community  goals  and  find  the  proper  policies  to  achieve 
them;  (3)  a  set  of  policies  which  maximize  benefits  and  mini-
mize  costs  for  those  sectors  of  the  local  community  whose  co-
operation  is  needed;  (4)  an  overall  organizational  approach 
which  isolates  the  process  from  day-to-day  politics;  (5)  a  com-
munication  system  which  provides  for  maximum  feedback  and 
response  among  the  participants  in  the  process;  and  (6)  enough 
local  consensus  to  implement  the  final  product,  or  power  from 
outside  the  community  to do  so  when  consensus  is  lacking.  The 
most  necessary-and  perhaps  even  the  sufficient-ingredient  is 
outside  power,  for  it  can  insist  on  many  kinds  of  local  action, 
short  of  major  behavior  and  attitude  change  on  the  part  of  the 
population. 

When  such  power  ought  to  be  used  and  when  nonpolitical 
decision-making  has  priority  over  the  local  political  process  is 
another  matter.  An  age-old  question  with  far-reaching  implica-
tions,  it  involves  a  choice  between  politics  and  planning,  demo-
cratic  and  elite  decisions,  majority  rule  and  the  public  interest, 
politicians  and  statesmen-and also  between  home  rule  and  re-
gional  or national  policy.  It is  even at  the  heart of the suburban 
critique,  in  the  choice  between  the  suburbanites'  satisfaction 
with their community and the critics' evaluation which considers 
such  satisfaction  irrelevant.  Proper  treatment  of  this  question 
and  its  various  dichotomies  requires  a  thorough  philosophical 
discussion which is out of place in the framework of a community 
study.  Yet since  my research  in Levittown raised  the question  in 
my  mind,  I  feel  compelled  to  conclude  with  at  least  a  cursory 
attempt at an answer. 

Obviously,  dichotomizing  the  question  is  dangerous; 

the 
choice  is  not  between  politics  or  planning,  etc.,  but  between 
their  relative  priorities  in  different  situations.  The real  issue  is: 
·when  should  outside  or  central  planning  replace  local  democ-
racy.  By  "local  democracy,"  I  mean  a  government  with  equal 
representation  for  all,  maximal  decision-maker  responsiveness, 
optimal  feedback  and  intervention  opportunities,  and  an  elec-
toral  system  that  prevents well-organized  minorities  from  voting 
in their candidates and policies. Levittown fell  shortof this ideal, 
what  with  Levitt's  power  and  the  government's  pervasive  feed-
back restriction.  But if the community is  genuinely democratic, I 

Politics  and  Planning 

•  397  • 

would begin with  the  value judgment that local  democracy  is  of 
high  priority, and  that  its  costs  must  be accepted  along  with  its 
benefits.  If people  are  entitled  to  determine  their  own  destiny 
and  to  do  so  by  majority  rule,  the  right  of  lower  middle  class 
citizens  to  run  their community  by  lower  middle class  priorities 
must also  be granted, even when this results  in decisions  that are 
undesirable from  another perspective.  If democracy is  important, 
one  cannot  set  up  another,  nonpolitical  criterion  for  decision-
making  every  time  the  decision  goes  the  wrong  way.  The  sub-
urban critic,  the city  planner,  and anyone else whose conception 
of  the  good  and  well-planned  community  deviates  from  that, 
say,  of lower  middle  class  Levittowners,  must  therefore  consider 
whether  his  vision  is  so  perfect  and  therefore  so  universal  as  to 
justify  the  downgrading of local  democracy. 

My feeling is  that no such conceptions have yet been put forth; 
upon analysis,  all  the  utopias and even  the more modest commu-
nity plans  turn out to reflect  the philosophies and styles of life of 
one  or  another  sector  of  the  cosmopolitan  upper  middle  class. 
Whatever their virtues-and these are many-they assume either 
a cosmopolitan population or a wholesale and magical conversion 
of noncosmopolitan  people  to  cosmopolitan  culture. Since  more 
than  95  per cent  of  Levittowners  (and  the rest  of  the  world)  are 
now  not cosmopolitan,  the assumption does  not speak  to  present 
policy alternatives. 

Consequently,  the  guidelines  I  suggested  in  Chapter  Eleven 
apply  here  as  well;  people  of  every  culture  have  the  right  to 
choose  what  they  want,  and  unless  it  can  be  proven  that  their 
choices  are  harmful  to  other  important  values  they  hold  or  are 
clearly self-destructive  and  antisocial,  they  also  have  the  right  to 
use  local  democratic  government  to  achieve  their  public  wants. 
The key word is antisocial, for it holds the clue to possible limita-
tions  of  majority  rule.  Antisocial  choices,  I  would  argue  sum-
marily, are those which ignore the  public interest, violate minor-
ity  rights,  and  prevent  the  achievement  of  minority  demands. 
The  nature  and  boundaries  of  the  public  interest  have  been 
debated  as  long  as  mankind  has  lived  in  communities,  but  I 
would take it to be either an interest that is consensual, shared by 
all  or almost  all  people  in  their role  as  community members,  or 
holistic, so  important  to  the  community as  a  whole  that  it must 
override  the  conflicting  personal  or communal  interests  of indi-
vidual  members. 49  Moreover,  each  must  be  divided  into  two 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

levels,  the absolute,  which  outweighs all  other  interests, and  the 
relative,  which  requires  a  determination  whether  the  public  in-
terest  is  actually  more  important  than  the diverging  personal  or 
community interests of its members.  A  matter of absolute  public 
interest  would  override  the  individual  interests  of  members;  a 
relative one might not. 

The  consensual  public  interest  of  either  level  can  be  deter-
mined  through  the  political  process,  for  in  casting  their  vote, 
people  can  presumably  decide  whether  the  issue  is  important 
enough  to  override  their  individual  interests.  Instances  of  the 
consensual  public interest are few  and far  between,  for  rarely do 
people  have  enough  in  common  to  unite  for  one  goal.  Perhaps 
Levittowners carne  close  to  consensus  in  wanting  to  avoid  racial 
conflict,  and  there  being  few  personal  interests  in  the  way,  they 
could consider it a  matter of absolute public interest. They prob-
ably  also  agreed  that  the  community  should  obtain  industry  to 
reduce  taxes,  but here the issue  is  one of relative  public  interest, 
for  once  the  means  of  obtaining  industry  are  considered,  other 
concerns  may  get  in  the  way.  For  example,  it  is  questionable 
whether  Levittowners would  willingly  pay  such  costs  as  a  bene-
ficial  tax  rate  to  industry,  the  publicly  financed  construction  of 
industrial  buildings, and the  provision of low-priced housing for 
workers.  These  costs  would  reduce  not  only  the  ultimate  tax 
benefits,  but  also  the  community's  status,  and  only  a  detailed 
benefit-cost analysis  could  tell  voters whether obtaining industry 
fits  the  consensual  public  interest  more  closely  than  a  reduced 
program of municipal services. 

Issues  in  the holistic public interest are also rare.  Although in-
terveners  often  claimed  their  own  demands  were  so  important 
that  they  justified  the  rejection  of  individual  interests,  I  cannot 
think  of a  single  issue  in  this  category  in  Levittown's  short  his-
tory.  A  clear  case  of  the  absolute  holistic  public  interest  is  the 
survival of the community and all its residents, and martial law is 
readily  invoked  in dealing with a  natural disaster.  But other  in-
stances are  hard  to  find.  If the community as  municipality went 
bankrupt,  and  if  state  or  federal  funds  were  not  available  to 
rescue  it,  one  could  argue  for  a  drastic  tax  increase,  although 
even then one might want to give residents the alternative of dis-
banding  the community  altogether.  Conversely,  the  holistic  in-
terest  does  not justify  repression  of riots.  It (and  the  consensual 
interest)  allows actions to prevent bloodshed,  but rioting itself is 

Politics  and  Planning 

clearly  a  desperate  method  of  minority  intervention  when  the 
government  has  been  insufficiently  responsive,  and  must  be 
treated as a  political  issue,  to be  resolved  by eliminating commu-
nity-based  grievances. 50  The  relative  holistic  public  interest  is 
hardest  to  determine,  for  it requires  the  comparison  of benefits 
and  costs  to  the  community as  a  whole  with  those  of  people  as 
community  members  and  individuals.  But  the  most  important 
benefits and costs are almost impossible to measure. 

The public interest is  so  easy  to  claim and so  difficult to deter-
mine  that  once  one  proceeds  beyond  consensus  and  community 
survival,  the  pluralism  of American  society  soon  interferes  with 
the assumptions of value  agreement and value  priority  inherent 
in  the  two  kinds  of  public  interest.  Communities  could,  of 
course, go  through  the complicated  process  of determining what 
values  its  members share  and what community values are  so  im-
portant that they outweigh all others, but populations and values 
are  not  always  stable.  Perhaps  the  only  solution  is  to  put  one's 
faith  in  the  local  political  process  (assuming  it  is  genuinely 
democratic),  letting  decision-makers  and  interveners  use  their 
conception  of  the  public  interest  as  a  campaign  or ·intervention 
strategy,  and hoping that the voters will opt for  the  public inter-
est as  they see it. 

A  special  case  of  the  public  interest  is  the  community's  long-
range  development,  which  requires  a  determination  of  whether 
future consensual or holistic public interest is  important enough 
to  justify  short-range  sacrifices.  I  would  argue  that  long-range 
needs  deserve  implementation  if  there  is  substantial  proof  that 
they  accord  with  present  public  interest  or  majority  values,  but 
that it is  unwise to give up important current priorities for goals 
in  the uncertain future.  Some needs can be proven;  present pop-
ulation  data  provide  unmistakable  evidence  of  the  need  for  fu-
ture  classrooms,  but a  long-range  land  acquisition  program  for 
local  suburban  parks  would  require  some  evidence  that  such 
parks will be used adequately; otherwise,  the money might better 
be spent for other needs. Of course, land can always  be purchased 
by the government and later turned to other uses  or even sold to 
private  developers,  but  given  low  suburban  densities,  I  would 
doubt whether the demand for future park use  is  high enough to 
divert money now, say,  from building more;: classrooms and estab-
lishing smaller  classes.  ~ong-range planning (which  demands no 
significant  current sacrifices)  is  always  desirable,  provided  it  ad-

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

dresses  itself to issues of the kind I  have described, rather than to 
the  realization  of  minority  demands  in  the  guise  of  long-range 
thinking. 

Minority interests must be divided  into demands and rights.  In 
a  genuinely  democratic  community,  minority  demands  have 
lower  priority than  those  of the  majority, although  the  ideal  is  a 
compromise  that  optimizes  the  achievement  of  both.  When  it 
comes to  minority rights, however,  the line must be drawn firmly 
and  their  priority  over  majority  values  must  be  asserted.  Such 
rights are guaranteed  by  the  Constitution, and  whether  they  are 
those  of  nonwhite  people  to  live  where  they  choose  or  of  indi-
viduals  with  deviant  opinions  to  utter  them  freely,  they  cannot 
be abrogated by the community. 

Up  to  this  point,  the  argument  has  assumed  local  autonomy: 
that the public interest and the definition of majority and minor-
ity  are  determined  by  the  boundaries  of  the  local  community. 
That  assumption  is  justified  on  issues  affecting  only  the  people 
living  within  these  boundaries,  but  these  are  increasingly  rare. 
When so  much of community life  is  shaped by forces  and agents 
impinging  from  the  outside,  no  community  can  be  an  island. 
This  is  particularly  true  of  suburbs,  whose  political  boundaries 
were drawn in rural times and are constantly ::rossed by the social 
and economic forces  that make  them  interdependent  with cities. 
The  principle  of majority  rule alone  would  justify that  the  ma-
jority demands or the public interest of the larger area take prec-
edence  over  the  community;  but  what  might  be  true  in  theory 
breaks down  in  practice,  for  there are  few  political  units or gov-
ernmental  bodies  with  enough  authority  or  power  to  act  in  be-
half of metropolitan  areas  or  the  social  and  economic regions  to 
which  cities  and  suburbs  belong.  The  limitations  of  the  local 
community  and  the  artificiality  of  its  boundaries  are  obvious 
enough,  but  this  does  not  thereby  generate  the  political  power 
needed  to  establish  new  governmental  bodies.  So  long  as  local 
government's  prime  function  is  to  protect  property  and  status 
values,  voters  will  not support  metropolitan  or  regional  govern-
ments.  Consequently,  state  and  federal  governments  are  pres-
ently the major resource for outside intervention. 

The Case  for  Outside Intervention 

I  pointed  out  earlier  that  the  most  important  ingredient  for 
nonpolitical  decisions  was  outside  power,  and  when  this  was 

Politics  and  Planning 

•  401  • 

exerted,  Levittown's  decision-makers  acted  accordingly  despite 
strong local  political  pressures  to act otherwise.  State and federal 
action are  therefore most effective  for  realizing what are  by local 
standards nonpolitical decisions.  Admittedly, such action  is  polit-
ical  as  well  and  depends  ultimately  on  voter  approval,  but  it  is 
easier  to  obtain  at  the  state  and  federal  levels  than  at  the  local 
level.  The  final  question  then  is:  How  much  and  what  kind  of 
outside intervention is  desirable in the  local  community? 

Generally  speaking,  outside  agencies  ought  to  be  empowered 
to  carry  out  the  local  (and  the  extra-local)  public  interest  when 
the  local  community  is  unwilling  to  do  so.  Similarly,  they  must 
enforce  the  minority  rights  guaranteed  by  the  Constitution  and 
by  federal  and  state  laws.  Yet  another  function  is  to  help  local 
minorities  attain  their  demands.  If a  minority  of  Levittowners 
wanted a  more cosmopolitan  school,  outside aid would  be  desir-
able  to  enable  the  local  school  board  to  provide  it  as  part of  its 
system  or as  a  separate school.  Such a  solution  is  possible  only if 
the  minority demand does  not conflict  with  the  majority  one;  it 
would  not work  for  a  minority wanting to  drive  on  the  left side 
of the street.  More important, since not all minority demands can 
be  satisfied  from  the  outside,  criteria  are  needed  for  choosing 
those  deserving  of  outside  financial  aid  or  political  support. 
Three such  criteria can  be advanced,  two  related  to  the commu-
nity, and one external to it. 

The first  is  the correction of the imbalances and inequities that 
result  from  local  autonomy  and  majority  rule.  Outside  power 
and aid should be used to satisfy those demands which can be met 
through  governmental  action,  provided  they  cannot  be  satisfied 
privately  by  these  minorities,  and  provided,  also,  the  minorities 
represent a  significant enough proportion of the community.  For 
example,  a  minority  which  cannot  afford  to  pay  for  its  need~ in 
the  private  economy  deserves  governmental  aid  before  a  more 
affluent  one,  for  government  ought wherever  possible  to  correct 
the  inequities of the  private economy.  But since  it cannot satisfy 
all  demands,  it  ought  also  to  give  priority  to  those  of  a  larger 
minority than  before tho~e of a  smaller one.  A second criterion is 
the outside correction  of local  irrationality.  Short-range  political 
considerations encourage local  governments to find  stop-gap solu-
tions,  but  an  outside  agency  can  demand  rational  ones  in  ex-
change  for  financial  aid.  For  example,  if  it  proposes  to  help 
eliminate juvenile delinquency, it can more easily set standards to 

•  402  • 

THE  LEVlTTOWNERS 

assure  programs that aid adolescents and to discourage  irrational 
adult repression. 

But given the shortcomings of local democracy and the limited 
role of local  communities in  the lives of their residents,  the most 
important  criterion  must  be  external:  the  goals  of  the  outside 
agency itself.  A  state agency ought  to  use  its  funds  and authority 
to  achieve  state  aims;  a  federal  one,  federal  aims.  The  federal 
government  usually  has  a  broader  perspective  than  the  local 
community,  as  well  as  more  power  to  correct  its  shortcomings, 
and  most state  go,·ernments should be  in a  similar position after 
reapportionment.  They  are  able  to  see  that  regional  needs  may 
require  apartments  in  single-family  home  suburbs,  or  that  the 
automating economy demands changes in local schools. Of course, 
outside  agencies  pursue  their  own  political  and  bureaucratic 
priorities  before  attending  to  more  general  state  or  national 
goals,  and  the  ideal  is  a  state  (and national)  plan  that sets  priori-
ties  for  what  local  facilities  and  services  are  to  be  affected  and 
subsidized by the state or federal  government.  Such  a  plan would 
enable the federal  government to decide,  for example,  that given 
the prospective changes in the economy and its job structure, edu-
cational subsidies to a suburban school system are more important 
than  recreational  subsidies,  but  that  if  work  time  is  reduced  a 
generation  hence,  recreational  ones  may  become  more  urgent 
than  others;  or  that subsidies  to  suburbs are  less  important than 
to the cities and  their low-income populations. 

Like  all  arguments  for  planning,  mine  ultimately  requires  a 
central  national  plan  which  determines  what  goals  and  policies 
are of highest priority. But central  planning requires a consensus 
on  national  goals  and  needs,  and  agreement  about  the  shape  of 
the future,  and  these are  hard to achieve.  The increasing role  of 
the  federal  government  in  the  affairs  of  local  communities  sug-
gests  that  such  a  plan  will  be  developed  eventually,  if  only  to 
guide the federal  Bureau of the Budget in its allocation decisions. 
Nor is  such a  plan as  impossible as  it seems, for on those issues on 
which  consensus  is  lacking,  the goals  of a  pluralistic  society  sug-
gest  that the demands of different groups ought  to be satisfied as 
much as  possible. If they know what they want,  these wants are at 
least given.  When  unanimity  is  not  possible,  the  best solution  is 
to encourage diversity. 

I  have  tried  to  argue  that  as  long  as  local  governments  make 
predominantly political  decisions,  outside  agencies  must require 

Politics  and  Planning 

•  403  • 

or  encourage  the. local  community  to  make  nonpolitical  ones. 
Even  then,  opportunities for  local  planning will  be  limited,  but 
national  planning for  local  communities may  be  feasible.  Given 
the  increasing  interdependence  of  the  local  community and  the 
national  society,  and  the  relative  insignificance  of local  commu-
nities in the lives  of their residents,  outside agencies are justified 
in  protecting the  public interest and  minority rights,  in looking 
after  minority  demands,  and  in  implementing  regional,  state, 
and federal  priorities. 

In  corning  to  this  conclusion,  I  have  proposed  a  number  of 
absolute  values  which  take  precedence  over  the  workings  of  the 
political process and limit majority rule. The fundamental  philo-
sophical  problem  remains:  once  politics,  democracy,  and  major-
ity rule are accepted,  it is difficult  to insist on exceptions, for who 
is  to say-and by  what  external  criterion-which absolutes  take 
precedence.  In  a  democratic  society  which  is  also  pluralistic, 
every  act  and  every  value  must  become  political,  and  seemingly 
nonpolitical  absolutes  may  only  reflect  the  interests  of  one  or 
another  sector  of  the  population.  If one's  choice  of  absolutes  is 
itself  political,  depending  on  the  values  of  whatever  economic, 
cultural,  or philosophical  interest group one belongs  to,  then so-
cial  scientists  or  cosmopolitans  are  likely  to  insist  on  absolutes 
different  from  those  of  low-income  Negroes,  for  example.  The 
search  for  truly  nonpolitical  absolutes  must  go  on,  but  it  may 
well  be that none exist beyond the survival  of the individual, the 
community, or the  nation.  Then, one can only  insist  on a  single 
absolute;  a  genuinely  democratic  society.  The  virtue  of  such  a 
society  is  that  it  gives  one  the  right  to  fight  politically  for  the 
other absolutes of one's  choice;  the  drawback,  that  if one  knows 
oneself  to  be  in  a  minority,  these  absolutes  are  not  likely  to  be 
accepted  by  the  majority. 

NOTES 

1.  I define rationality here  as  the determination of the most effective 
means  of  achieving  a  stated  goal;  it  refers  to  the  methods  for 
bringing  about  a  goal  rather  than  to  the  choice  of  goals  or  the 
process  of determining  this  choice. 

2.  Although I use  the terms "desegregation"  and "integration" inter-
changeably  for  styli~tic reasons,  I  am  describing how  Negroes  ob-

tained the right to purchase houses in the community, rather than 
their  social  integration  in to  it. 

3·  Bressler,  p.  127. 
4·  This assumption turned out to be inaccurate, for when Levittown 
was integrated,  the salesmen of smaller subdivisions  told potential 
customers  hair-raising  and  totally  inaccurate  stories  about  the 
amount  of  integration,  conflict,  violence,  and  blight  that  had 
taken  place,  promising  them  that  the  small  subdivisions  would 
remain  totally  white.  Eventually,  SDAD  acted  to  halt  this  prac-
tice,  an<.!  the  Burlington County  Human  Relations Council made 
special  efforts  to  find  Negro  buyers  for every  small subdivision  in 
the area. 

5·  As  I  pointed out in Chapter Two,  1 per cent of the  buyers (3  per 
cent from  the cities)  volunteered racial  change  as  their main  rea-
son  for  leaving  their  former  residence,  and  g  per  cent  (about  a 
fifth  of  city  dwellers)  checked  it  as  an  important  reason  on  a 
fifteen-item  list. 

6.  Not  all  Jews  supported  desegregation.  I  was  personally  quite 
shaken  by  a  bitter  attack  on  it  by  a  Jewish  leader  who  had  sur-
vived the German concentration camps. The majority Jewish view 
was  probably like  that of one Levittowner,  who  told  me,  "I don't 
want Negroes in Levittown, and I don't want Jews associated with 
interracial  attempts,  but I  won't  picket.  We  are  a  minority  too." 
7·  A  door-to-door  survey  made  by  a  local  paper  with  a  more  ran-
domly chosen sample than is  usually  the case showed that in  1959. 
sixteen  Levittowners  interviewed  were  opposed  to  integration, 
while only  two  favored  it. 

8.  Fears of intermarriage undoubtedly also fed on the powerful white 

fantasy  about  Negro  sexual  potency. 

g.  Also,  some  lawyers  felt  that he had a good case  for  his  interpreta-
tion  of  FHA  insurance  and  that  it  might  be  upheld  by  the  U.S. 
Supreme Court. 

10.  Later, a company official explained to me that if the state Supreme 
Court  should  unexpectedly  find  for  Levitt,  the  company  could 
always  reverse  itself  and  not  sell  to  Negroes.  In  July  1g6o,  the 
court  ruled  8  to  o  against  Levitt,  however,  and  since  Levittown 
had  by  then  been  desegregated  peacefully,  the  firm  did  not  take 
the  case  to  the  U.S.  Supreme Court. 

11.  Despite  the lack of violence,  the disturbance and integration split 
the  community  politically  for  several  years.  The  effects  of  the 
disturbance  are  described  by  Bressler. 

12.  For  another  report  on  Levittown's  integration,  prepared  by  the 

consultant, see  U.S.  House and Home Finance Agency. 

13.  The politicians had been burned the previous year by cooperating 
with  Levitt  on  the  liquor  issue  and  the  name  change,  and  were 
loath  to  help out again,  especially  on  this  seemingly  more explo-
sive  issue. 

14·  Reluctance  about  integration  came from  ministers  whose  congre-

Politics  and  Planning 

gants  wete  of  lower  socioeconomic  status,  especially  the  funda-
mentalist  ones.  Interestingly  enough,  the  decision  to  announce 
integration  on  a  Sunday  left  out  the  two  rabbis,  for  they  would 
not  meet  their  congregations  again  until  the  following  Friday. 
Evidently no one was  much concerned about opposition from  the 
Jewish  community. 

15.  On  the  other hand,  township  officials  made  sure  that  people  op-
posed  to or ambivalent about integration  were  abo seated on  the 
Council,  for  they  feared  that  they  and  the  Council  would  other-
wise  be described  as  tools of  the  integrationists.  Anti-integration-
ists  were,  however,  outnumbered in  the  Council.

17.  The survey showed that only  11  per cent of all prospects indicated 
any  interest  in  the  question  of  racial  occupancy.  Furthermore,  4 
per cent registered  mild disapproval,  2.4  per cent were  unwilling 
to buy a house next to a Negro family,  and only 1.7 per cent "gave 
evidence of holding uncompromising views in opposition to racial 
inclusion and therefore might be considered to be 'lost' prospects."

18.  Since  the  private  lots  were  more  desirable  and  slightly  more  ex-
pensive,  they  also had  a  higher resale  value.  This not only  made 
them  easier  to  resell,  but  also  prevented  generalizations  that 
Negroes  reduced  property  values  and  resale  prices. 

19.  This figure  was  reported  to  me  by  a  sales  manager and  includes 
some who changed their mind for  reasons other than  the color of 
their  neighbors. 

20.  A  May  1963  survey  showed  that  only  three  houses  were  vacant 
adjacent  to  the  32  Negro  families.  U.S.  Housing  and  Home  Fi-
nance Agency,  P- 19. 

21.  The  experts  were  ineffectu<ll  also  because  it  was  thought  they 
were  hired  by  the  builder  to  "brainwash"'  opposition  to  his  de-
cision,  because  they  were  outsiders  and  ignorant  of  local  condi-
tions-many  describing  Levittown  as  culturally  and  socially  ho-
mogeneous-and  became  they  talked  down  to  the  audience.  The 
only  lecturer  to  make  a  favorable  impression  was  a  Negro  social 
worker  who,  according  to  one participant,  "gave  us  the  facts  and 
no  propaganda."  He  was  dark-skinned  (thus  providing  many 
Levittowners  their  first  opportunity  to  meet  "a  really  black  Ne-
gro"),  talked  in  a  mild  tone,  and  was  not  insistent  on  attitude 
change. 

22.  Neighbor social  pressure not  to  sell  to  Negroes  was  quite  intense. 
When  I  prepared  to  sell  my  own  house,  I  was  made  aware  that 
most  of  my  neighbors  were  opposed  to  integration.  Since  I  was 
friendly  with  many  pro-integration  leaders,  a  rumor  swept  my 
block  that  I  had  sold  my  house  to  a  Negro  family.  Although  I 
thought  about  doing  so,  I  decided  not  to,  mainly  because  I 
planned  to  continue  the  fieldwork  for  another  year  and  felt  it 
would  be  endangered.

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

23.  One  of  the  two  resales  to  a  Negro  family  had  earlier  been  listed 
with  a  local  realtor  who  had  forgotten  to  take  down  his  sign. 
When he heard that the house had been  sold  to a  Negro,  he hur-
riedly  removed  his  sign,  but  for  a  while  his  competitors gleefully 
spread  the false  rumor  that he  had been  responsible  for  the  sale. 
24.  A comparison of the number of move-ins during the same months 
of 1959 and 1g6o  shows  that from January to March 1960, arrivals 
were  50  per  cent  of  those  in  the  same  months  in  1959.  Between 
April and June, when integration had been  announced,  they  rose 
to 106  per cent of 1959  arrivals;  but between July and September, 
they  dropped  to  40  per cent  and  from  October  to  January  to  45 
per cent of the preceding year's arrivals.  This was  only 5  per cent 
less  than in the three months preceding the  integration announce-
ment,  however. 

25.  In  the  last  half of  1958  Levitt  had  sold  487  homes,  and  in  1959, 
2174,  but in 1g6o sales dropped to 848;  in  1961,  to 729;  in  1962,  to 
575;  in  1963,  to  416;  and  in  1964,  to  a  low  of  336.  In  1965  and 
1966  sales  began to rise  again,  to about 8oo per year. 

26.  The federal  study of  Levittown's integration  came  to  no definite 
conclusion about the impact of integration on sales.  U.S.  Housing 
and  Home Finance Agency,  pp.  17-19. 

27.  In  1966,  William  Levitt  testified  personally  and  enthusiastically 
before  the  Congress  in  favor  of  an  open-occupancy  clause  in  the 
1966  Civil  Rights  Act,  arguing  as  he  had  in  the  past  that  no 
builder  will  desegregate  his  community  unless  all  builders  are 
required  to do so. 

28.  U.S.  Housing and Home Finance Agency,  pp.  21-22. 
29.  Bressler,  p.  33· 
30.  Indeed,  I  doubt  whether more  than  1  or 2  per cent of  the  white 
adult population has ever met any of the  Negro  Levittowners. 
31.  Of course,  it could be argued  that initial  integration  would  have 
discouraged  militantly  segregationist  purchasers,  which  in  turn 
might have attracted more Negroes.  But  the latter could not have 
known  this;  besides,  hostility  toward  them  would have  come  not 
from  the  militants,  but  from  a  community  climate  which  per-
mitted  the militants  to express  their opposition.  The community 
climate might have  been  poorer if  more  Negroes  had  purchased, 
although their number would have had to increase tenfold  before 
it would have deteriorated significantly.  Actually, so  few  Negroes 
can  afford  to  buy in Levittown  that I  doubt whether initial  inte-
gration would have  increased  their numbers materially. 

32.  The main,  Levitt-owned,  center was  built in  contemporary  style, 
however,  since  the idea  for  Colonial  elevations  was  not  proposed 
until  after it had  been  started. 

33·  See  Township  of  Willingboro.  For  unfathomable  reasons,  most 
master  plans  begin  with  a  community  description  which  is  writ-
ten,  not  for  the  residents  who  must  pass  on  the  plan,  but  for 
someone  who  has  never  been  in  the  community.

tions,  to  which  my  own  analysis  is  heavily  indebted,  see  Banfield

munalist  public  interest,  involving  ends  which  community  mem-
bers share as  community members,  and  the individualistic public 
interest, involving ends which  community members share as  indi-
viduals  (pp.  323-324).  Since  both  conceptions  require  consensus, 
I  have  lumped  them  here,  although  people's  interests  as  com-
munity members may conflict with those  they hold as  individuals.

LEVITTOWN  AND  AMERICA

I  BEGAN  THIS STUDY  WITH  FOUR  QUESTIONS,  THE  ANSWERS  TO  WHICH 
can  be  generalized  to  new  towns  and  suburbs  all  over  America. 
First,  a  new  community  is  shaped  neither  by  the  builder,  the 
planner,  and  the  organizational  founder,  nor  by  the  aspirations 
with  which  residents  come.  A  builder  creates  the  physical  shell 
of  the community;  a  founder,  the  social  one;  but even  when  or-
ganizations  and  institutions are  initiated  by  national  bodies out-
side  the  community,  they  can  only  survive  by  attracting  people 
and responding  to  their demands.  If resirlents  lack  choice among 
churches  or  clubs,  individual  founders  can  impose  their  will  or 
their vision of the community  on  the  residents,  but such  lack  of 
choice  is  rare.  Aspirations of residents  are  usually  limited  to  the 
house,  family  life,  neighboring,  and friendship;  people  ha\'e  few 
that concern  the  larger  community  aJld  the  demands  they  make 
on it emerge after they have  settled down.  Only  when  they  have 
lived on  their blocks for  a  while  can  they decide  what  functions 
must be filled  by the rest of  the community,  and only  when  they 
have  met  their  fellow  residents  can  they  determine  where  com-
patible people  are to be found  and  how  they want  to  sort  them-
selves.  In short, their choices of  (and  within) community  institu· 
tions  are  basically  a  function  of  the  population  mix  they  en-
counter. 

These choices  are  not made  in  a  vacuum,  but  involve  values 
and preferences which  people bring with them.  Perhaps the most 
significant fact  about  the origin of a  new community is  that  it  is 

•  408  • 

Levittown  and  America 

not new at all,  but only a  new  physical  site  on which  people de-
velop  conventional  institutions  with  traditional  programs.  New 
towns  are  ultimately  old  communities  on  new  land,  culturally 
not significantly different from  suburban subdivisions and urban 
neighborhoods inhabited by the same kinds of people, and politi-
cally much like other small American towns. 

Second,  most  new  suburbanites  are  pleased  with  the  commu-
nity  that develops;  they enjoy  the  house and  outdoor living and 
take  pleasure  from  the  large  supply  of compatible  people,  with-
out  experiencing  the  boredom  or  malaise  ascribed  to  suf)urban 
homogeneity.  Some  people  encounter  unexpected  social  isola-
tion,  particularly  those  who  differ  from  the  majority  of  their 
neighbors.  Who will  be socially  isolated depends on  the commu-
nity;  in  Levittown,  they  were  older  couples,  the  well  educated 
and  the  poorly  educated,  and  women  who  had  come  from  a  co-
hesive working class or ethnic enclave or were used to living with 
an extended family.  Such people probably suffer in every suburb; 
even though they want to escape from  the close  life of the "urban 
village,"  they  miss  their old haunts, cannot fmd  compatible peo-
ple,  or  do  not  know  how  to  make  new  friends.  But  the  least 
happy  people  are always  those  of lowest  income and  least  educa-
tion;  they not only have  the most difficulty  in making social  con-
tacts and joining groups,  but are also  beset by financial  problems 
which strain family  tempers as  well  as  family  budgets.  And  if the 
suburb is  designed for young adults and children, the adolescents 
w'il.l  suffer from  "nothing to do" and from  adult hostility toward 
their youth culture and peer groups. 

People's lives are changed somewhat by  the move  to suburbia, 
but  their  basic  ways  remain  the  same;  they  do  not develop  new 
life  styles  or ambitions  for  themselves  and  their children.  More-
over,  many of  the changes  that do take place were desired  before 
the  move.  Because  the  suburb makes  them  possible,  morale goes 
up,  boredom  and  loneliness  are  reduced,  family  life  becomes 
temporarily  more  cohesive,  social  and  organizational  activities 
multiply,  and  spare-time  pursuits  now  concentrate  on  the  house 
and yard.  Some changes result from  the move:  community organ-
izational  needs encourage some  people  to  become joiners for  the 
first  time,  ethnic  and  religious  difference  demands  more  syna-
gogue  attendance,  and  social  isolation  breeds  depression,  bore-
dom,  and  loneliness for  the  few  who  are  left  out.  But change  is 
not  unidirectional;  different  people  respond  differently  to  the 

•  410  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

new environment, and the most undesirable changes usually stem 
from familial and occupational circumstances. 

Third,  the sources or causes  of change are  not  to  be  found  in 
suburbia per se,  but in the  new house,  the opportunity for home 
ownership, and  above  all,  the  population mix-the people  with 
whom one  now  lives.  They bring about  the intended  increase  in 
social  life,  the  unintended  increase  in  organizational  activity, 
and,  of  course,  the  equally  unintended  social  isolation.  Some 
changes can  be traced  to the openness of the social  structure in a 
new community and people's willingness to accept and trust each 
other,  as  well  as  to  the  random  settling  pattern  which  requires 
them  to  make  friends  with  strangers  next  door  or  to  leave  the 
block  for  the  larger  community  to  find  compatible  people.  But 
most  result  from  the  homogeneity  of  age  and class  of  the popu-
lation  that buys  into a  new  suburb.  Indeed,  the  basic sources  of 
change  come  from  goals  for  home  ownership,  a  free-standing 
house,  outdoor  living,  and being with  people  of similar age  and 
class, which have long been basic aspirations of American working 
and  middle  class  cultures. 1  Even  unintended  changes  could  be 
traced  finally  to  national  economic  trends  and  cultural  patterns 
that push people out of  the city and provide  incentives for  build-
ers  to  construct  communities  like  Levittown.  Ultimately,  then, 
the changes people undergo  in  the move  to the suburbs are only 
expressions of more widespread societal changes and national cul-
tural goals. 

Fourth,  the  politics  of  a  new  suburb  is  no  more  distinctive 
than  the  rest  of  its  life.· In  any  heterogeneous  community,  con-
flicting  demands  from  the voters  force  the decision-makers  to  set 
up a  performing government  which  observes  democratic  norms, 
freeing  them  to  reconcile  these  conflicts  in  a  backstage  actual 
government. Their decisions are, more often than not, responsive 
to the majority of voters when that majority makes demands,  but 
are unresponsive to powerless minorities, which therefore have to 
intervene-to upset  the  normal decision-making process  in order 
to  get  satisfaction.  Since  they  fail  more  often  than  they  succeed, 
local  government  generally  neglects  minority  demands  and 
rights, and the public interest as well.  Experts with sufficient con-
sensus, skill,  and power can implement decisions unpopular with 
the  majority,  but  on  the  whole,  such  decisions  have  to  be  en-
forced  by  nonlocal  agencies.  Of course,  suburbs  like  Levittown 
have  few  of  the  problems  that  face  American  cities,  dying small 

LeviUown  and  America 

•  4U  • 

towns, or stagnant rural areas, so that local governments can meet 
the  limited  needs  of at least  their dominant  constituents.  Supra-
local  governments must  be developed,  however,  to deal  with  the 
problems generated by the myriad of suburban sovereignties and 
the artificiality of suburban boundaries. 

THE  POTENTIAL  FOR  INNOVATION  AND  CHANGE 

My four  initial  questions  were  joined by  a  common  theme:  To 
what extent is a community made by its residents and to what ex-
tent  by  leaders,  planners,  and  other experts  who  want  to  stimu-
late innovation and  change? The findings,  I  would suggest,  dem-
onstrate  again  an  important  sociological  truth  and  truism,  that 
what happens in a community is  almost always a  reflection  of the 
people  who  live  in  it,  especially  the  numerical  and cultural  ma-
jority. That majority  supports  the  organizations and  institutions 
that  define  the  community;  it determines  who  will  be  enjoying 
life  and  who  will  be  socially  isolated;  and  it  forms  the  constit-
uencies  to which decision-makers are responsive.  In the last anal-
ysis,  then,  the community (and it origin, impact, and politics) are 
an  outcome  of  the  population  mix,  particularly  of its  dominant 
elements and their social structure and culture. 

The  processes  by  which  this  community  outcome  is  achieved 
are  conflict-ridden.  A  modern  community  is  not  like  a  folk  cul-
ture, in which congruence between  the community and  its  popu-
lation  is  achieved by a  widespread consensus about behavior and 
values.  In  Levittown,  the congruence is  much less  perfect, and is 
produced  by  power  struggles,  which  are  constantly  resolved  by 
compromises  so  that  institutions  and  organizations can  function 
in  an  orderly  manner.  These  struggles  are  unending,  for  every 
compromise  solves  only  the  immediate  conflict,  and  new  issues 
arise all the time. Whether the compromisers are parents, organi-
zational  leaders,  or  elected  officials,  they  spend  a  great  deal  of 
time  and  energy  in averting what  they define  as  crises,  and  pre-
serving  the  fragile  equilibrium  by  which  congruence  between 
community and society  is  engineered. As  a  result, all  other issues 
are  pushed  into  the  background,  including  innovation  and 
change.  And  when  decision-makers  cannot  satisfy  everybody, 
there  is  rarely  time  or  energy  for  any  but  the  most  numerous, 
powerh,1l, or vocal constituents. 

Under  these  conditions,  founders,  innovators,  and  individual 

•  412  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

"change  agents,"  expert  or  otherwise,  can  do  little.  They  may 
suggest  new  ideas,  but  before  these  are  implemented,  they  have 
been  altered  to  make  them  responsive  to  important  constitu-
encies.  'Without  initiators,  nothing  can  begin,  but  once  the 
initiative  has  been  taken,  the social  process transforms it.  People 
who  can  initiate  successfully  and  anticipate  the  required  trans-
formations are made leaders and often get credit for  the workings 
of  the  social  process-and  those  who  want  to  be  leaders  learn 
quickly  what  will  be  successful.  Only  rarely  is  such  a  role 
awarded to innovators. 

These  findings  could  easily  be  used  to  justify  the  status  quo, 
but that  is  not my conclusion  or my  purpose.  The study suggests 
that  change  and  innovation  are  always  possible,  but  not  easily 
achieved.  No  group  or community  is  impervious  to  c~ange, but 
neither  is  it  an  aggregate  of  open-minded  people  who  do  not 
know  what  they  want  and  can  be  persuaded  to  shed  their  past. 
Consequently, advocates of innovation and change cannot be sat-
isfied  (as  they so  often are)  with appealing for  something new or 
by demanding conformity to  their ideas  (as  they  so  often do)  be-
cause they are convinced of  the superiority of what  they propose. 
Groups and communities are fluid systems,  with leaders who have 
some-but precious little-leeway  in  their decisions. If that  lee-
way  is  to  be  used  for  innovation,  change  agents  who  lack  the 
·power to  insist  on change  or the resources  with which to  reward 
people  for  undertaking  it  must  offer  distinctly  superior  alterna-
tives  to  present  arrangements.  No  community and  no  social  ar-
rangement satisfies everyone, and as  the data on Levittown make 
persuasively  evident,  even  when  most  people  are  happy  with 
their  new  community,  some  are  not.  The  best  approach  to 
change,  therefore,  is  to give  up  the  single  solution  that compro-
mises  between  the  wants  of  different groups,  and  to  experiment 
with  new  solutions  for  dissatisfied  groups  and  cultures  in  the 
total  population.  This  means  a  diversity  of  housing,  living  ar-
rangements,  and  institutions, either within the  same community 
or in separate ones,  keyed to the diversity of background, culture, 
and aspirations relevant to community life. 

Conflict,  Pluralism,  and Community 

Although  a  part of my study was  concerned with  the  possibil-
ities  of  change  and  innovation,  I  do  not  mean  to  suggest  that 
Levittown  is  badly in  need  of  either.  The  community  may  dis· 
please  the professional  city planner and the  intellectual  defender 

Levittown  and  America

of cosmopolitan culture,  but perhaps more than any other type of 
community,  Levittown  permits  most of  its  residents  to  be  what 
they want to  be-to center  their lives  around  the  home and  the 
family,  to  be  among  nei:;hbors  whom  they  can  trust,  to  find 
friends  to share leisure hours,  and  to  participate in organizations 
that  provide  sociability  and  the  opportunity to  be  of  service  to 
others. 

That Levittown has  its faults  and problems  is  undeniable, and 
I  have  described  them  in  previous chapters:  physical  and  social 
isolation,  familial  and  governmental  financial  problems,  insuffi-
cient public  transportation,  less  than  perfect  provision  of  public 
services,  inadequate decision-making and feedback processes,  lack 
of  representation  for  minorities  and  overrepresentation  for  the 
builder, and the entire array of familial  and individual problems 
common to any population.  Many of them can be traced  back  to 
three  basic  shortcomings,  none  distinctive  to  Levittown  or  the 
Levittowners. 

One is the difficulty of coping with conflict.  Like  the rest of the 
country,  Levittown  is  beset  with  conflict:  class  conflict  between 
the lower middle class group and  the smaller working and upper 
middle  class  groups;  generational  conflict  between  adults,  chil· 
dren, adolescents, and the elderly.  The existence of conflict  is  no 
drawback,  but the  way  conflict  is  handled  leaves  much  to  be  de-
sired.  Levittowners,  like  other  Americans,  do  not  really  accept 
the inevitability of conflict.  Insisting that a consensus  is  possible, 
they  only  exacerbate  the  conflict,  for  each  group  demands  that 
the  other conform  to  its  values  and  accept  its  priorities.  When 
power is a  valuable prize and resources are scarce, such a  perspec· 
tive  is  understandable,  but in  Levittown  the exercise  of power is 
not an end in itself for most people;  they want  it mainly  to  con-
trol  the allocation of resources.  Since  resources  are  not so  scarce, 
however,  the  classes  and  age  groups  could  resolve  their  conflicts 
more constructively tban they do, giving each group at least some 
of what it wants.  If the inevitability of conflicting  interests  were 
accepted,  differences  might  be  less  threatening,  and  this  would 
make  it  easier  to  reach  the  needed  compromises.  I  am  not 
sanguine  that  this  will  happen,  for  if  people  think resources  are 
scarce,  they act as  if they are scarce, and will  not pay an extra $20 
a  year  in  taxes  to  implement minority demands.  Even  so,  condi-
tions  to make  viable compromises  happen are more favorable  in 
Levittown than in larger or poorer communities. 

The second shortcoming, closely  related  to  the  first,  is  the jna-

•  41 4  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

bility  to  deal  with pluralism.  People  have  not recognized  the di-
versity of American society, and they are not able to accept other 
life  styles.  Indeed,  they cannot  handle conflict because  they  can-
not accept pluralism. Adults are unwilling to tolerate adolescent 
culture,  and  vice  versa.  Lower  middle  class  people  oppose  the 
ways  of  the  working  class  and  upper  middle  class,  and  each  of 
these  groups  is  hostile  to  the other two.  Perhaps  the  inability to 
cope  with  pluralism  is  greater  in  Levittown  than  elsewhere  be-
cause  it  is  a  community  of  young  families  who  are  raising  chil-
dren.  Children are essentially asocial  and unacculturated beings, 
easily  influenced  by  new  ideas.  As  a  result,  their  parents  feel  an 
intense  need  to  defend  familial  values;  to  make  sure  that  their 
children grow  up according  to  parental  norms  and  not  by those 
of  their  playmates  from  another  class.  The  need  to  shield  the 
children from  what are considered  harmful  influences  begins on 
the block, but it is  translated into the conflict over the school, the 
definitional  struggles  within  the  voluntary  associations  whose 
programs affect the socialization of children, and, ultimately, into 
political  conflicts.  Each group wants  to  put its cultural  stamp on 
the  organizations  and  institutions  that  are  the  community,  for 
otherwise  the family  and  its culture are  not safe.  In  a  society  in 
which extended families are unimportant and the nuclear family 
cannot  provide  the  full  panoply  of  personnel  and  activities  to 
hold children in the family culture, parents must use community 
institutions for this purpose, and every portion of the community 
therefore  becomes  a  battleground  for  the  defense  of  familial 
values. 

This thesis  must  not  be  exaggerated,  for  much  of  the  conflict 
is,  as  it  has  always  been,  between  the  haves  and  the  have-nots. 
Even if Levittown's median  income is  considerably above the na-
tional  average  even  for  white  families,  no  one  feels  affiuent 
enough  to  let  other  people  determine  how  their  own  income 
should be spent.  Most  of  the  political  conflict  in  the community 
rages over how  much of the family  income should be given over 
to the community, and then,  how it should be used.  In fact,  con-
sensus  about  municipal  policies  and  expenditures  exists  only 
about the house.  Because many Levittowners are first-time  home-
owners,  they are especially eager to protect that home against loss 
of value, both as  property and as  status image.  But every class has 
its  own  status  image and its  own  status fears.  Working class  peo-
ple  do  not  want  to  be  joined  by  lower  class  neighbors  or  to  be 

Levittown  and  America 

•  415  • 

forced  to adopt middle class styles.  Lower middle class people do 
not want more working class  neighbors or to  be forced  to  adopt 
cosmopolitan  styles,  and upper middle class  people want neither 
group  to  dominate  them.  These  fears  are  not,  as  commonly 
thought,  attributes  of  status-seeking,  for  few  Levittowners  are 
seeking higher status;  they are  fears  about self-image.  When  peo-
ple reject pluralism, they do so  because accepting the viability of 
other ways  of living suggests  that  their  own  is  not as  absolute  as 
they  need  to  believe.  The  outcome  is  the  constant  search  for 
compatible  people  and  the  rejection  of  those  who  are  different. 
\Vhen  the  three class  groups-not  to  mention  their subgroup-
ings  and  yet  other  groups  with  different  values--must  live  to-
gether  and  share  a  common  government,  every  group  tries  to 
make sure  that  the  institutions and  facilities  which  serve  the en-
tire community maintain  its own  status and culture, and no one 
is  happy when  another  group  wins.  If working class  groups  can 
persuade  the  Township  Committee  to  allocate  funds  for  a  fire-
house,  middle  class  groups  unite  'in  a  temporary  coalition  to 
guarantee that a  library is  also  established.  When the upper mid-
dle class  group attempts to  influence school  policy  to shape edu-
cation  to  its  standard,  lower  middle  class  residents  raise  the 
specter of Levittown aping Brookline and Scarsdale, while work-
ing class  people  become  fearful  that  the  schools  will  neglect dis-
cipline or  that  taxes  will  rise  further.  Consequently,  each  group 
seeks  power  to  prevent  others  from  shaping the  institutions  that 
must be shared.  They do not seek  power as  an  end in itself,  but 
only  to  guarantee  that  their  priorities  will  be  met  by  the  com-
munity.  Similarly,  they  do  not  demand  lower  taxes  simply  for 
economic  reasons  (except  for  those  few  really  hard  pressed)  but 
in order to be sure that community institutions are responsive to 
their  familial  values  and  status  needs.  Obviously,  power  sought 
for these ends is  hard to share, and decisions for levying and allo-
cating public funds are difficult to compromise. 

The  third shortcoming of  the community,  then,  is  the  failure 
to  establish  a  meaningful  relationship  between  home  and  com-
munity and  to reconcile  class-cultural  diversity with government 
and  the  provision  of  public  services.  Levittowners,  like  other 
Americans,  not only see  government as  a  parasite and  public ser-
vices  as a  useless  expenditure of funds  better spent privately, but 
they  do  not  allow  government  to adapt  these  services  to  the  di-
versity among the residents.  Government is  committed to  the es-

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

tablishment  of  a  single  (and  limited)  set  of  public  services,  and 
its  freedom  to  do  otherwise  is  restricted  by  legislation  and,  of 
course,  by  American  tradition.  Government  has  always  been  a 
minor  supplier  of  services  basic  to  everyday  life,  and  an  enemy 
whose  encroachment  on  private  life  must  be  resisted.  The  pri· 
mary source of this conception is  the historic American prejudice 
against  public services,  which  stems  in  part from  the  rural  tradi-
tion  of the  individual  and his  family  as  a  self-sufficient  unit,  but 
which is  perpetuated by contemporary cultural  values,  and made 
possible  by  the  affluence  which  embles  at  least  middle  class 
families  to  live  with  only minimal  dependence  on  local  govern-
ment.  The  bias  against  public  services  does  not  interfere  with 
their  use,  however,  but only  with  their  fmancin~, and  their  ex-
tension and proliferation.  Nor does it lead Levittowners to reject 
government  outright,  but  only  to  channel  it  into  a  few  limited 
functions.  Among these,  the primary one is  the protection of  the 
home against diversity. 

Government  thus  becomes a  defense  agency,  to  be  taken  over 
by  one  group  to  defend  itself  against  others  in  and  out  of  the 
community. The idea  that it could  have  positive functions,  such 
as  the provision of facilities to make life richer and more comfort-
able,  is  resisted,  for  every  new  governmental  function  is  seen 
first  as  an  attempt  by  one  community  group  to  increase  its 
dominance over others.  Of course,  these attempts are rarely man-
ifest, for  the political dialogue deals mainly with substantive mat-
ters,  but when  Levittowners  spoke  against  a  proposal,  they  were 
reacting  principally  against  those  who  proposed  it  rather  than 
against its substance. 

Until government can  tailor  its actions  to  the community's di-
versity,  and  until  people  can  accept  the  inevitability  of conflict 
and  pluralism  in  order  to  give  government  that  responsibility, 
they  will  prefer  to  spend  their  money  for  privately  and  com-
mercially  supplied  services.  Unlike  city  hall,  the  marketplace  is 
sensitive to diversities among the customers and does not require 
them  to  engage  in  political  conflict  to  get  what  they  want.  0£ 
course,  not all  people can  choose  the  marketplace over  city  hall, 
but  Levittowner-s  are  affluent  enough  to  do  so.  Moreover,  until 
parents have steered their children safely into their own class and 
culture--or have given up trying-they are likely to seek out rela-
tively  homogeneous  communities  and  small  ones,  so  that  they 
have  some  control  over  government's  inroads  against  personal 

Levittown  and  America 

and  familial  autonomy.  This not  only maintains  the sovereignty 
of  hundreds  of small  local  governments  but  also  contributes  to 
the desire to own a house and a free-standing one. 

LEVITTOWN AS  AMERICA 

The  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  Levittown  are  those  of  many 
American  communities,  and  the  Levittowners  closely  resemble 
other young  middle  class  Americans.  They are  not  America,  for 
they  are  not  a  numerical  majority  in  the  population,  but  they 
represent  the  major constituency  of  the  largest and  most  power-
ful  economic and  political  institutions  in American  society-the 
favored  customers and voters whom  these  seek  to attract and sat-
isfy.  Upper  middle  class  Americans  may  spend  more  per  capita 
and  join  more  groups,  but  they  are  fewer  in  number  than  the 
lower  middle  classes.  ·working and  lower  class  people  are  more 
numerous but  they have  less  money and  power;  and people  over 
forty,  who  still  outnumber young adults,  are  already committed 
to most of the goods, affiliations, and ideas they will need in their 
lifetime. 

Even  so,  Levittowners are  not really  members of  the  national 
society,  or for  that  matter; of a  mass  society.  They are  not  apa-
thetic conformists ripe for  takeover  by a  totalitarian  elite or cor-
porate  merchandiser·;  they  are  not  conspicuous  consumers  and 
slaves to sudden whims of cultural and political  fashion;  they are 
not even  organization  men or  particularly other-directed  person-
alities.  Clearly  inner-directed  strivers  are  a  minority  in  Levit-
town,  and  tradition-directed  people  would  not  think  of moving 
to  a  new  community  of  strangers,  but  most  people  maintain  a 
balance  between  inner  personal  goals  and  the  social  adjustment 
necessary  to  live  with  neighbors  and  friends  that,  I  suspect,  is 
prevalent all  over lower middle class America. Indeed, the inabil-
ity to empathize with diversity would suggest that inner-direction 
may  still  be  a  much  stronger  pattern  among  the  Levittowners 
than  it  was  among  the  upper  middle  class  people  studied  by 
Riesman  and  his  associates.2  Although  ethnic,  religious,  and 
regional  differences  are  eroding,  the  never  ending conflicts  over 
other  differences  are  good  evidence  that  Levittowners  are  far 
from becoming mass men. 

Although  they  are citizens of a  national  polity and  their  lives 
are  shaped  by  national  economic,  social,  and  political  forces, 

•  418  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

Levittowners  deceive  themselves  into  thinking that  the  commu-
nity,  or  rather  the  home,  is  the  single  most  influential  unit  in 
their  lives.  Of  course,  in  one  way  they  are  right;  it  is  the  place 
where  they  can  be  most  influential,  for  if  they  cannot  persuade 
the  decision-makers,  they  can  influence  family  members.  Home 
is  also  the  site  of  maximal  freedom,  for  within  its  walls  people 
can  do  what  they  want  more  easily  than  anywhere  else.  But 
because  they are  free  and  influential  only  at  home,  their depen-
dence on  the  national  society  ought to be  obvious to  them.  This 
not  being  the  case,  the  real  problem  is  that  Levittowners  have 
not  yet  become  aware  of  how  much  they  are  a  part  of  the  na-
tional society and economy. 

In  viewing  their  homes  as  the center of life,  Levittowners are 
still  using  a  societal  model  that  fit  the  rural  America  of  self-
sufficient  farmers  and  the  feudal  Europe  of  self-isolating  ex-
tended  families.  Yet  the  critics  who  argue  about  the  individual 
versus  mass  society  are  also  anachronistic;  they are  still  thinking 
of  the  individual  artist  or  intellectual  who  must  shield  himself 
from  a  society which either rejects  him or coopts  him  to produce 
popular culture.  lloth  Levittowners and critics  have  to  learn that 
they  live  in  a  national  society  characterized  by  pluralism  and 
bureaucracy, and that the basic conflict is  not between individual 
(or  family)  and  society,  but  between  the  classes  (and  other  in-
terest groups)  who live  together in a  burealfcratized political and 
cultural  democracy.  The  prime  challenge  is  how  to  live  with 
bureaucracy;  how  to  use  it rather  than  be used  by it;  how  to  ob-
tain  individual  freedom  and  social  resources  from  it  through 
political action. 

Yet  even  though  Levittowners  and  other  lower  middle  class 
Americans .continue  to  be  home-centered,  they  are  much  more 
"in the world"  than  their parents and grandparents were.  Those 
coming  out  of  ethnic  working  class  backgrounds  have  rejected 
the  "amoral  familism" 8  which  pits  every  family  against  every 
other  in  the  struggle  to  survive  and  the  ethnocentrism  which 
made  other  cultures  and  even  other  neighborhoods  bitter  ene-
mies.  This generation trusts its neighbors, participates with them 
in social and civic activities,  and no longer sees governmeot as  in-
evitably corrupt.  Even  working class  Levittowners have  begun  to 
give  up  the  suspicion  that  isolated  their  ancestors  from  all  but 
family  ;md  childhood  friends.  Similarly,  the descendants of rural 

Levittown  and  America 

•  41 9  • 

Protestant  America  have  given  up  the  xenophobia  that  turned 
previous generations against the Catholic and Jewish immigrants, 
they  have  almost  forgotten  the  intolerant  Puritanism  whicli 
triggered  attacks  against  pleasure  and  enjoyment,  and  they  no 
longer fully accept the doctrine of laissez fa ire that justifies the de-
fense  of all  individual rights and privileges against others' needs. 
These and other changes have come about not because  people 
are now  better or more tolerant human beings,  but because  they 
are affluent.  For  the  Levittowners,  life  is  not a  fight  for  survival 
any  more;  they  have  been  able  to  move  into  a  community  in 
which income and status are equitably enough distributed so that 
neighbors are no longer treated as  enemies,  even  if  they are still 
criticized  for  social  and  cultural  deviance.  By  any  yardstick  one 
chooses,  Levittowners  treat  their  fellow  residents  more  ethically 
and  more  democratically  than  did  their  parents  and  grandpar-
ents.•  They also  live a  "fuller"  and  "richer"  life.  Their culture 
may be less subtle and sophisticated than that of the intellectual, 
their family life less  healthy than that advocated by psychiatrists, 
and their politics  less  thoughtful and democratic than the politi-
cal  philosophers'-yet all of these are  superior to what prevailed 
among the working and lower middle classes of past generations. 
But  beyond  these  changes,  it  is  striking  how  little  American 
culture among the Levittowners differs from what De Toqueville 
reported in his travels through small-town middle class America a 
century ago.  Of course,  he was  here  before  the  economy needed 
an  industrial  proletariat,  but  the  equality  of  men  and  women, 
the  power  of  the  child  over  his  parents,  the  importance  of  the 
voluntary association,  the social  functions  of the church,  and the 
rejection of high culture seem to be holdovers from his time, and 
so  is  the adherence to the traditional virtues:  individual honesty, 
thrift,  religiously  inspired  morality,  Franklinesque  individual-
ism,  and  Victorian  prudery.  Some  Levittowners  have  retained 
the  values  of  rural  ancestors;  some  have  only  begun  to  practice 
them as  affluence enabled them to give up the values of a  survival-
centered culture. Still other eternal verities remain;  class conflict 
is as  alive as  ever,  even if the struggle  is  milder and  the have-nots 
in Levittown have much more than the truly poor. Working class 
culture  continues  to  flourish,  even  though  its  rough  edges  are 
wearing smooth  and  its  extended  family  and  public  institutions 
are  not  brought  to  the  suburbs.  Affluence  and  better  education 

•  420  • 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

have  made  a  difference,  but  they  have  not  made  the  factory 
worker  middle class,  any more  than college  attendance has  made 
lower middle class people cosmopolitan. 

What seems  to have  happened  is  that improvements and inno-
vations  are added  to  old culture  patterns,  giving affluent Ameri-
cans  a  foot  in  several  worlds.  They have  more  knowledge  and  a 
broader  outlook  than  their  ancestors,  and  they  enjoy  the  advan-
tages  of  technology,  but  these  are  superimposed  on  old  ways. 
While  conservative  critics  •ail  about  technology's  dehumaniza-
tion of modern man, the Levittowners who spend their days  pro-
gramming  computers  come  home  at  night  to  practice  the  very 
homely  and  old-fashioned  virtues  these  critics  defend. 5  For  ex-
ample,  they  have  television  sets,  but  they  watch  much  the  same 
popular  comedies  and  melodramas  their  ancestors  saw  on  the 
nineteenth  century  stage.  The  melodramas  are  less  crude  and 
vaudeville  is  more  respectable;  the  girls  dance  with  covered 
bosoms,  but  Ed  Sullivan's  program  is  pure  vaudeville  and  "the 
Jackie  Gleason  Show"  even  retains  traces  of  the  working  class 
music hall.  The overlay of old and new is  not all good, of course; 
the  new  technology  has  created  methods  of war  and  destruction 
which  the  old  insularity  allows  Americans  to  unleash  without 
much  shame or guilt,  and some  Levittowners  may  find  work less 
satisfying  than  their ancestors.  But only  some,  for  the  majority's 
parents slaved  in  exhausting jobs which  made  them  too  tired  to 
enjoy the advantages of suburbia even if they could have afforded 
them. On  the  whole,  however,  the  Levittowners have  only  bene-
fitted  from  the  changes  in  society  and  economy  that  have  oc-
curred  in  this  century,  and  if  they  were  not  given  to  outdated 
models  of  social  reality,  they  might  feel  freer  about  extending 
these  benefits  to  less  fortunate  sectors  of  American  society.  But 
whether  people's  models  are  anachronistic  or  avant-garde,  they 
are rarely willing to surrender their own powers and privileges to 
others. 

LEVITI'OWN  AND  THE  FUTURE  OF  SUBURBIA 

Presently  available  data  make  it  certain  that  another  suburban 
housing  boom  will  take  place  during  the  next  ten  years.  As  the 
children  born  during  the  period  of  high  family  formation  and 
fertility after World War II become parents, they will need hous-
ing  to  raise  their  own  children,  and  will  almost  surely  want  to 

Levittown  and  America 

•  421 

• 

find  it  in  the  suburbs. 6  Unless  a  sharp  economic  downturn  re· 
duces  middle  class  employment  opportunities  and  either  slows 
down  the  rate  of  family  formation  or  forces  young  families  to 
double  up with their parents,  yet  another ring of suburbart com-
munities will spring up around most American cities. 

The form  the newest suburbia will  take  is  as  yet  unknown.  In 
most  metropolitan  areas,  the  current  building  of  subdivisions, 
one  by  one,  will  probably  continue.  Where  land  for  suburban 
development  is  running short,  the  single-family  house  may  give 
way  to  the  row  house;  where  land  is· plentiful  (as  in  the  West) 
more  comprehensively  planned  new  towns  with  their  own 
sources of employment are possible. 1  In big cities like New York 
and Chicago, where the remaining vacant land is  more than forty 
miles  from  downtown,  future  suburban growth  may  be  reduced 
by  the  unwillingness  of commuters  to  travel  over  an  hour  each 
way,  although  this  may  in  turn  generate  more  support for  high-
speed mass  transit.  But the present trend of industrial decentrali-
zation is  likely to increase as  well,  so  that more job opportunities 
will  be  available  in  the  suburbs  themselves,  bringing  yet  more 
vacant land into the range of an acceptable journey to work. And 
if  the  decentralization  of industry  is  accompanied  by  the  decen-
tralization of offices,  nothing should impede further suburbaniza-
tion  in  all  American  cities. 

This  likelihood  is  already  being  viewed  with  alarm  in  some 
quarters.  Advocates  of the city are  fearful  that further  suburban 
development  can  only  result  in  added  physical,  financial,  cul-
tural, and political deterioration of the cities. They are joined by 
opponents of urban sprawl and by conservationists who are afraid 
that  new suburbanization will  further reduce rural  acreages  and 
may even cut into  the  forests  and wildernesses  that now  provide 
recreational  opportunities and land reserves at the edges of many 
metropolitan areas.  In this coalition can also  be found  the critics 
of suburbia,  concerned  that an  undesirable way  of life  will  pro-
liferate even  further in  the  next generation. 

Some of these fears  may be reasonable, but none justify halting 
suburbanization.  The  inaccuracy of the suburban  critique  indi-
cates that if  the suburbs have  positive consequences for  the  pres-
ent generation  of young  parents,  they will  have  similar  ones for 
the  next  generation.  Although  suburbanization  may  further  in-
crease  residential  segregation  by class  and race,  class  segregation 
may be reduced as class  lines within the middle class and between 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

the  lower  middle  and  working  class  are  blurred.  And  if  future 
suburbanization  takes  the  form  of new  towns  and  large subdivi-
sions,  these  will  be  (like  Levittown)  more  heterogeneous  than 
small subdivisions  and  urban  neighborhoods-which  have  often 
been  one-class  and  one-race  areas. 

The fear  of more urban sprawl also seems exaggerated.  Urban 
sprawl  is  an  inefficient  use  of  land rather  than  the  absolute evil 
it  has  been  labeled,  but  it  also  promotes  flexibility  of  growth. 8 
If employment opportunities continue  to decentralize,  the waste-
ful  features  of  urban  sprawl  may  be  reduced,  partly  because 
vacant  areas  will  be  filled  in,  but mostly  because  new  suburban 
centers with  industry and  offices  as  well  as  shopping centers  will 
develop  all  over  the  metropolitan  area.9  Indeed,  in  the  future, 
the  present  mononuclear  metropolis,  with  a  downtown  center 
surrounded by a disordered mass  of urban and suburban areas of 
low  density,  is  likely  to  become  a  multinuclear  one  with  many 
centers,  of  which  downtown  is  only  the  oldest and  most  impor-
tant. 

Probably the major disadvantage of urban sprawl  is  the prolif-
eration  of  small  local  government. 10  Although  it  provides  peo-
ple with considerable control over their own destinies,  it discour-
ages  public  action  on  the  many  metropolitan-wide  problems.  A 
logical  case  can  be  made  for  some  form  of  metropolitan  govern-
ment, and the case has been made logically since the beginning of 
the twentieth century.  Unfortunately, its advocates often see only 
the  advantages  for  the  larger  area,  but  ignore  the  very  real  dis-
advantages for local  communities. These have  opposed metropol-
itan government in  the past  as  a  trespass on local  autonomy,  and 
for  fear  of domination  by  predominantly white Catholic or non-
white working class  urban voters.  (On the other hand, as  suburb-
anization continues, city residents may begin to oppose it for fear 
of  domination  by  white  middle  class  suburbanites.)  If the  ele-
ments of metropolitan  government  can  be' separated  into  those 
badly needed  and  universally  wanted,  those  which  only  increase 
governmental  efficiency  and  economy  at  the  cost  of  local  auto-
nomy, and those which are made unworkable by intense class and 
race conflicts, it may be possible to promote the first.  Federal sub-
sidies,  now  already  beginning  to  flow,  may  make  it  worthwhile 
for  suburbs  to  band  together  with  other  suburbs  and  with  the 
city  on  selected  problems  and  public  services.  But  further  sub-
urbanization  would  not  affect  the  chances  of  metropolitan  gov-

Levittown  and  America 

ernment.  The  suburbs  of  the  next  decade  and  generation  may 
strengthen  existing  small  communities,  but  they  will  not  add 
many new ones  to the welter of local  government. They will  not 
cut down governmental  sprawl,  but neither will  they  increase  it. 
The reduction  in  open  space  is  even  less  serious.  Despite  the 
uproar  over  "megalopolis,"  there  is  an  immense  amount  of  va-
cant  land  even· within  that  alleged  belt  of  city  running  from 
Boston  to  Norfolk.  Most  of America  is  less  densely  settled  than 
the Eastern seaboard, and as  Hans Blumenfeld once pointed out, 
the country is  so  rich  in land that all  Americans could be housed 
at  suburban  densities  in  the  buildable  parts  of  California.  The 
disappearance  of  farmland  near  the  big cities  is  irrelevant  now 
that  food  is  produced  on  huge  industrialized  farms,  and  the  de-
struction of raw land and private upper class golf courses seems a 
small  price  to  pay for  extending the benefits  of  suburban  life  to 
more people. 

More  recreational  acreage  will  be  needed  with  increasing 
leisure  time,  but principally as  small  parks  in  the dense  portions 
of the city and as larger ones for weekend and vacation trips. The 
latter can  be located at  the edge of the  metropolitan  area,  where 
they  can  be  made  accessible  by  expressways  and  mass  transit. 
Moreover,  parks  are  much  less  important  than  beaches,  lakes, 
amusement areas, camping sites, and motels with adjacent recrea-
tion  facilities.  Wildernesses  provide  a  desirable  recreation  re-
source,  but they are used by  relatively  few  people per acre.  Mak-
ing  inexpensive  and  efficient  transportation  available  to  distant 
wildernesses  would  be  more  sensible  than  preventing  many 
people from  living in  the suburbs in order to  retain a  wilderness 
nearby  in  which  a  handful  can  seek  solitude  a  few  times  a  year. 
Actually,  the conservationist  opposition  to  further  suburbani-
zation rests less  on the need for recreational land than on a desire 
to  reserve  vacant land  for  future  generations,  and  this  in  turn  is 
based  less  on  accurate  predictions of actual  land needs  than  on a 
value  judgment  that  the  preservation  of  open  land  is  more  im-
portant  than  the current needs  of people.  Although  land should 
be saved for requirements of ecological  balance and for  the use  of 
future generations if current needs are not urgent,  I  believe  that 
restricting  current  development  for  an  unpredictable  future  is 
undesirable.  We do not know  today how Americans will  want to 
live  fifty  years  from  now,  or  where.  By  then  work and  play  pat-
terns  may  have  changed  so  much  that many  people will  want  to 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

live a  hundred miles or more  beyond the city limits. Transporta-
tion methods may be available to bring a  wilderness five  hundred 
miles  away  within  easy  and  cheap  reach  of  every  metropolitan 
area  resident,  and  economic  and  technological  devices  for  rapid 
land-use changes may  have  been created.  Consequently,  ignoring 
the  present demand  for  land  in order to  save  it for an  unknown 
future  demand  by  our  grandchildren  cannot  easily  be  justified. 
For  this  reason,  I  suspect  that  conservationist  opponents  of 
suburbanization  are  less  concerned with  future  land needs  than 
with a  desire  to preserve land from  people.  Many-although not 
all-of  the  advocates  of  wilderness  preservation  are  ideological 
descendants of the nineteenth century conservatives who opposed 
European immigration because they did not want America to be-
come a  country of non-Puritan city dwellers.  In preserving open 
land,  they  also  wanted  to  preserve  America  as  a  predominantly 
rural,  predominantly Protestant society in which  they held  polit-
ical  and  cultural  power.  The  idea  that  America  ought  to  be  a 
country of open spaces  rather than one of people deriving maxi-
mum  utility and  pleasure  from  the  land  still  exists  today  and  is 
manifested  by opposition  to  proposals  that virgin  lands  (note  the 
phrase)  be  opened  up  for  intensive  recreational  use.  Opponents 
fear  that  the  land  will  be  "spoiled"  by  unappreciative  (read 
urban  middle  and  working  class)  populations.  They  choose  to 
bar  people  instead  of  demanding sufficient  funds  to  remove  the 
garbage  left  behind  by  people  who  have  engaged  in  the  very 
"constructive  and  wholesome"  recreational  pursuits  that  wilder-
ness advocates also favor. 

The  final  source  of  opposition  to  further  suburbanization 
comes  from  the  defenders  of  the city.  As  the  white  middle  class 
continues  to  leave  the  cities,  these  become  more  and  more  the 
residence of a small number of rich people-at least in the biggest 
metropoli-and of a  large number of poor people, many of them 
nonwhite.  This  trend  is  alleged  to  destroy  cities  as  centers  of 
civilization,  on  the  assumption  that culture  can  be  created  only 
in the city.  Cities were centers of culture in the  past, not because 
they were cities,  but because  they  housed  the upper-income  pop-
ulations  who  supported  the  creators  of  culture.  The  current 
flourishing  of culture  in  many  American  cities  denies  the  tradi-
tional  assumption,  for  while  its  supporters  have  been  living  in 
the  suburbs  for  more  than  two  generations,  they  have  not  only 
returned  to  the  city  to  use  its  cultural  facilities,  but  have  also 

Levittown  and  America 

•  425  • 

generated  suburban  facilities,  a  trend  that  will  increase  more 
rapidly  in  the  next  decades.  Whether  or  not  the  dominance  of 
poor  people  in  the  cities  will  affect  the  creators  of  culture  is 
harder to judge, but many who supply the middle class with cul-
ture  are  already  living  in  suburbs  and  exurbs  without  loss  of 
creativity,  while  new  urban  (but  not  middle  class)  culture  is 
coming  into  being  for  the  ever  larger  pool  of  poor  people. 

As  more  middle  class  taxpayers  move  beyond  the  city  limits, 
they  will  reduce  the  tax  income  of  the  city  even  as  a  further 
influx of poor people increases  the need for  costly  municipal  ser-
vices.  The next round of suburbanization should not worsen  the 
situation,  however,  for  many of the young people who wiJI  want 
suburban houses  in  the coming years  are already  in  the suburbs. 
Even  so,  it  is  obvious  that  urban  governments  are  in  poor  eco-
nomic  health  and  that  something  has  to  be  done.  The  solution 
is  not,  however, to attempt to  reverse  a  residential  process  that is 
not really  reversible,  but  to  find  new  sources  of  income  for  the 
cities.  Recent  federal  legislation  has  established  the  principle 
that  cities  must  be  subsidized  by  federal  funds,  and  some 
cities are already levying payroll taxes that require suburban com-
muters to  pay for  their use of city  services  and income taxes that 
counteract the decline of receipts from the property tax. The best 
solution, however, is  probably a single federal  income tax,  a  por-
tion of which would be distributed to  the taxpayer's community. 
This  would  not  only  eliminate  the  need  to  raise  property  tax 
rates as  property  values  decline,  but  would  also  result in  higher 
tax  levies,  for  there  is  less  public  opposition  to  federal  income 
taxes,  and  tax  receipts go  up with  increasing  incomes. 

The  political  feasibility  of  this  solution  is  not  enhanced  by 
further  suburbanization,  however,  for  as  more  and  more  white 
middle  class  people  move  to  the  suburbs  they will  be extremely 
reluctant  to  support legislation  to subsidize  the urban nonwhite 
poor.  This possibility  is  frightening,  but  it cannot  be dealt with 
by  attempting  to  prevent  further  suburbanization.  If the  next 
generation  of  young  families  wants  to  live  in  the  suburbs  and 
can afford  to do  so,  it  will  vote down any  programs  that  restrict 
its  freedom  of residential movement.  Some young people may be 
persuaded  to  remain  in  or return  to  the  city  by  urban  renewal 
programs,  but their numbers are not likely  to  be large,  for  even 
with  increasing college attendance,  the proportion  of  city-loving 
cosmopolitans remains  minute. The only  solution  I  can see  is  to 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

permit further  suburbanization,  but in  ways  which  prevent  fur-
ther economic deterioration of the city.  Payroll  and income taxes 
are  one  answer,  but  federal  subsidies  to  the  city,  sweetened  by 
grants  for  services  wanted  by  suburbs  and  commuters,  may  be 
able  to  obtain  the "suburban vote." 

All  of these  problems are immensely complicated by the racial 
difference between city and suburban residents,  by the persistent 
increase  in  the  proportion of nonwhite residents  in  the  city  and 
the  equally  persistent  ability  of  the  suburbs  to  maintain  racial 
exclusion  practices.  If suburbanization continues  on  the  present 
basis,  an increasingly nonwhite city surrounded by rings of white 
suburbs may  make  efforts  to  solve  the problems of  the city even 
more difficult  than  they are  today.  Even so,  one  little-recognized 
obstacle  to  the  solution  of  these  problems  is  the  very  image  of 
the predominantly nonwhite city-as a  bankrupt, disintegrating, 
violent  and  corrupt  municipality.  This  image  is  a  fantasy,  a  re-
flection of white middle class fears, felt most strongly by white sub-
urbanites  who  will  have  to  commute  to  the  stores,  offices,  and 
cultural  facilities  of  the  city.  In  reality,  such  a  city  will  not  be 
chaotic, and for nonwhite residents, it may well be more desirable 
than today's  nominally integrated city. 

Although there are many Negroes, middle class or with middle 
class  aspirations,  who want to live in an integrated suburb, there 
are  many  more,  not  yet  middle  class,  who  would  favor  further 
white  suburbanization  because  they  would  be  able  to  leave  the 
slums  for  better  urban  neighborhoods  deserted  by  the  whites. 
Moreover,  if  they  became  a  political  majority  in  the  city,  they 
might  be  able  to  elect  officials  more  sensitive  to  their  needs  for 
public  services  and  their  priorities  for  the  allocation  of  public 
funds  than  the  present  white  incumbents  are.  A  predominantly 
nonwhite  city  would  be  even  poorer  than  today's  city,  but  Ne-
groes  are  voters,  and  if  they  can  only  give  up  their  habitual 
allegiance  to  the  urban  Democratic  machines  and  threaten  to 
bolt  the  national  Democratic  party,  whichever  party  is  in  power 
in  Washington  will  be motivated  to  increase  federal  subsidies  to 
the city.  If they  can  also  persuade  Washington  to  develop  effec-
tive  antipoverty programs that will  create  better  jobs and higher 
incomes,  they  will  be able  to  achieve a  higher  standard of  living 
and will  be less angry and hostile  toward middle class whites than 
they  are  today.  Since  white  anxieties  about  the  predominantly 
nonwhite  city  are  ultimately  based  on  class  rather  than  race, 

Levittown  and  America 

these  anxieties  would  be  reduced  considerably.  Indeed,  those 
suburbanites  who  prefer  the  city  but shun  it  now  because  they 
do not want poor neighbors may return to  take advantage  of its 
urbanity. 

Opponents of further  white  exodus also  argue-as they  have 
for generations-that it means a loss  of "civic leaders"  to the city 
and less  concern  for the city  on the  part of upper  income people 
with downtown property holdings. From the point of view of the 
remaining white middle class residents,  this  loss is  real,  since the 
civic  leaders represent  some  of  their  interests  in  the  city  power 
structure. The low-income population may see it otherwise,  how-
ever,  for  control  of  public  welfare  and  private charity  by  these 
civic leaders  has  only helped to  keep  it a  proletarian  underclass. 
And  whether  the owners  and  managers  of downtown real  estate 
would act differently if they  lived in the city has yet  to be shown. 
Most  likely, their behavior  is  determined by profit  potential and 
property tax rates. 

The possibility that a  city governed by  the  leaders of  the non-
white poor population may  have advantages  for  that  population 
does  not,  however,  reduce  the  urgency  of  the  need  to  integrate 
the suburbs.  Not only will the number of nonwhites who want to 
live in the suburbs and  in integrated communities on either side 
of the city limits increase in the years to come, but the continuing 
exodus of job opportunities into the suburbs makes it essential for 
nonwhite workers  to  be able  to  live  near  these  sources  of work. 
Consequently,  present  and  future  suburbs  have  to  be  opened 
to  nonwhite  residents.  Indeed,  the  goal  is  not  to  hold  back 
further  suburban  development,  but  to  make  sure  that  its 
benefits are extended to all  parts of the population, regardless of 
color and class. 

The  implementation  of  racial  integration  in  the  suburbs  is 
almost  as  difficult  as  the  restriction  of  future  suburban  growth. 
Although Levittown accepted the peaceful integration of a  hand-
ful  of  Negro  middle  class  families  once  state  law  had  made  it 
mandatory, I doubt whether it or any other suburb would volun-
tarily open its doors to larger numbers of nonwhite people, espe-
cially those of lower income and status.  The only solution  is  fed-
eral  action.  When  it becomes  politically  feasible  for  the  federal 
government  to  require  "open  housing,"  either  through  legisla-
tion  or  executive  order,  not  only  will  the  legal  imperative  per-
suade many suburbanites to accept the inevitable, but if all com-

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

munities  must  integrate,  no  one  can  expect  to  live  in  all-white 
communities. 

But  legal  integration  is  not sufficient,  for  only a  small  propor-
tion  of the total  nonwhite  urban  population can afford to  live  in 
the  suburbs.  Consequently,  the  federal  government  must  also 
mount  a  massive  housing  program,  combining  rent  subsidies, 
builder subsidies, and perhaps even direct federal  construction to 
enable nonwhite city dwellers to move to the suburbs. 11  A  similar 
program should enable others to move  to better urban neighbor-
hoods  and  yet  others  to  new  and  rehabilitated  housing  in  the 
ghetto.  Many  liberals  have  debated  long and  earnestly  whether 
new,  or rebuilt, housing should be provided in the ghetto as  long 
as  white  opposition  makes  integrated  housing  impossible,  or 
whether new housing should be built only outside the ghetto and 
even  outside  the city  to  prevent  the  perpetuation of segregation, 
even  if this means less new housing for Negroes  in the short run. 
But  this  dichotomy  is  false  and  dangerous.  Residential  integra-
tion  is a  highly  worthwhile goal,  but  it  is  not the only goal,  par-
ticularly  since  so  far  it  has  helped  mainly  middle  class  Negroes 
and has  often decreased available inexpensive housing for poorer 
Negroes,  for  example,  when  urban  renewal  displaces  them  to 
make  room  for  integrated  middle  and  high  income  projects. 
Moreover,  not  all  Negroes  want  to  move  to  the  suburbs  today, 
some  want  to  stay  in  the  city,  and  some  even  in  the  ghetto,  al-
though  unfortunately  no  one  knows  what  proportion  of  the 
ghetto  population  wants  (or  can  afford)  each  of  the  three  alter-
natives. There is no reason why better housing cannot be built in 
the ghetto and the suburbs integrated concurrently. 

The  process  of  integration  (suburban  and  urban)  would  have 
to be planned and paced  to avert white panic over racial  invasion 
and  status decline.  Levittown's successful  integration  is  evidence 
that such  planning is  possible. Since the first  nonwhite suburban-
ites  will  undoubtedly  be  middle  class  or  aspiring  middle  class 
people, and since  the  kind of lower class  Negro whom suburban-
ites  fear  would  probably  be neither willing nor able  to  move  to 
the  suburbs  for  another  generation,  the  real  difficulties  of  inte-
gration are much  smaller  than  the  imagined ones.  It seems  hard 
to  believe  that the lower class  Negro family without job security 
or the unmarried mother would have much incentive to move to 
the  suburbs  even  with  federal  housing  subsidies;  both  want  to 
leave the slums,  but for better housing in the city. 12

The  costs  of  federal  programs  to  improve  living  conditions 
and  public  services  in  cities  (and  suburbs)  will  be  high,  and 
they  have  to  be  paid  with  public  funds.  Some  of  these  funds 
ought  to  come  from  suburbanization  itself,  and  specifically 
from  the  huge  increases  in  land  values  that  accompany  resi-
dential  development.  In  the  past,  the  federal  government  has 
supported suburban growth  through  FHA and VA  mortgage  in-
surance,  tax  writedowns  to  builders,  and  the  construction  of ex-
pressways,  but  neither  it  nor  local  and  state  governments  have 
obtained their share of the increase  in land values or of the spec-
ulative  profits created as  rural  land became suburban.  High spec-
ulative  profits  are  oft<m  justified  by  the  amount  of  risk  in  resi-
dential  development,  but these  risks  have  been  reduced  to  near-
nothing in the past two decades. Since the new suburban boom is 
virtually  a  certainty,  and  since  it  can  only  take  place  in  a  rela-
tively small number of locations in most metropolitan areas,  risks 
will  be even  smaller in  the future,  especially  if rent subsidy  pro-
grams are added  to  the present  array  of mortgage  insurance  and 
other  forms  of  risk  reduction  for  developers  and  builders.  Con-
sequently,  governments  should  be  participating  in  the  "profits" 
that come from  land turnover and suburban  building.  Indeed,  it 
would be desirable  to work out a  formula  by which taxes on land 
use change  increase as  risk  is  decreased;  and  these  taxes  ought to 
help pay for governmental subsidies. 

The  Suburban  Community of the  Future 

Although  a  number  of  changes  should  be  made  in  the  next 
round  of  suburbanization,  I  can  see  no  reason  to  oppose  its  oc-
currence  or  to  discourage  the  building  of  more  Levittowns. 
Whether  or not  the  Levitt  organization  will  or  should  build 
more  Levittowns  is  not  the  issue;  I  would  argue,  rather,  that 
more  communities  like  Levittown  are  desirable  if  people  want 
them.  Not only are  they more  efficient  than a  myriad  of smaller 
subdivisions,  but  they  permit  the  builder  to  install  community 
facilities  because of the economics resulting from  the scale of his 
operation. 

Of course, future new communities should learn from  and im-
prove  upon  Levittown.  For  instance,  prior  planning  should 
occur,  particularly to anticipate tax problems, and more physical 
facilities  should  be  installed  before  the  community  is  occupied. 
Not  only  should  builders  be  expected  to  include  some  of  the 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

capital  and  operating costs  of  these  facilities  in  the  house  price, 
but  federal,  state,  and  local  housing  agencies  should  subsidize 
those  facilities  which cannot be provided by the builder without 
·a  drastic  increase  in  the  house  price.  Federal  or  state  planning 
powers  and  subsidies  should  also  encourage  the  coordination  of 
residential  construction  with  industrial  location,  to  encourage 
factories  and offices  that can share the tax burden.  Even so,  most 
new suburbs will  be without industry,  and federal  aid to schools 
and other municipal services will  probably be needed  to provide 
those  rejected  by  local  voters.  Here  too,  financing  local  services 
from a diverted federal  income tax would be helpful. 

The suburban  facilities  which  ought  to  be subsidized first  are 
those needed or demanded by minorities but not likely to be pro-
vided  either by  the builder  or  by voters  once  the  community  is 
occupied.  Among  these  are  higher-quality  schools,  meaningful 
activities  for  teenagers,  and  more  comprehensive  programs  of 
public health. Community medical  health insurance programs in 
lieu of or in addition  to  federal  Medicare schemes would  be de-
sirable  to  reduce  the  high  cost  of medical  care  for  families  with 
young  children. 13  Community  mental  health  clinics  and  agen-
cies  that will  provide personal and family counseling are needed, 
as  are  community credit  unions  which  can  provide  low-interest 
loans  to  people  under  financial  pressure,  and  local  newspapers 
and other media to increase both social  and political communica-
tion  within  the  community.  Needless  to  say,  better  transporta-
tion  (both  within  the  community  and  to  the  outside)  than  was 
available in  Levittown during the time of my study is a necessity. 
As  the boundaries of the metropolitan area expand, all suburban 
communities and  urban neighborhoods ought to  be accessible  to 
each  other  and  to  the  downtown  and  suburban  centers  of  em-
ployment,  entertainment,  and  shopping.  Finally,  local  and  re-
gional  planning agencies  which  can  provide  benefit-cost  analyses 
for  the  solution  of  intracommunity  and  intercommunity  prob-
lems ought to be established. 

If government  took  a  major  role  in  the  preplanning  of  com-
munity facilities,  the  power of a  single  builder over the commu-
nity would be reduced. The problem is  to maximize his freedom 
to  build a  large-scale  venture and  to  innovate,  while  supervising 
him sufficiently so  that he will  provide for community needs that 
purchasers cannot voice  until  they have  moved  in.  For example, 

Levittown  and  America 

•  431  • 

Levittowners had  no chance to determine the size  of  the  schools, 
and  while  most  were  satisfied  with  what  Levitt  provided,  they 
should have had some choice in the matter. Ideally,  Levitt should 
have  been  required  to  build  larger  schools  at  the  start  or  to  in-
clude a  higher  portion  of  municipal  services  in  the  house  price, 
with any needed increases in house price made up by  federal  sub-
sidies  for  facilities.  Or  Levittowners  could  have  decided  among 
themselves  after  they  moved  in  whether  they  wanted  smaller 
classrooms,  and  then  resorted  to  public  controls  on  the  builder 
and federal subsidies to provide them. 

But perhaps the best form of control over the builder is choice. 
If people  are  told  what  community  plans  and  what  level  of  ser-
vices  they  are  buying  when  they  purchase  a  house,  and  if  they 
have alternative choices  in different  communities,  then  their  de-
cision  to  buy  assumes  agreement  with  the  proposed  level  of  ser-
vices.  Planning  for  the  next  round  of  suburban  communities 
should  reflect  the  increasing  diversity  of  life  styles  and  should 
ensure that many different kinds of communities are built. Some 
might  be like  today's  Levittown,  others might be equipped with 
more social  and recreational  facilities  (like  Reston, Virginia, and 
Columbia,  Maryland),  and  some  might  have  only  the  barest 
minimum  of  facilities  for  buyers  who  want  to  use  the  superior 
facilities  of  the  city.  Similarly,  there  ought  to  be  new  towns 
which  provide jobs  for  people  who want  to  keep  their  commut-
ing to a  minimum.  Variations  in  density and  house  style  should 
also  be  encouraged.  Row  house  and  garden  apartment  commu-
nities ought  to  be  built for  people  who  prefer to do less  garden-
ing  and  home  maintenance,  and  quasi-rural  communities 
might  be  constructed  to  allow  people  to  do  some  farming  in  a 
basically  suburban  environment.  Small  communities  like  those 
suggested  by  Paul  Goodman  might  be  founded  for  people  who 
want to participate directly in government and want to run their 
own  school  systems  and  municipal  services.  Many of  these  alter-
natives  will  not  be  politically or economically  feasible,  but  they 
ought to  be tried out on a  small  scale,  perhaps in a section  of an 
otherwise  typical  suburb.  Government  funds  ought  to  be  made 
available for such experiments, so  that it is  possible  to determine 
which can be built on a larger scale. 

But the most important priority for  future suburban planning 
is  the population  mix,  for  ultimately it determines the quality of 

THE  LEVITTOWNERS 

suburban  living.  In  suburbia  sui  generis,  the  population  mix 
must be broadened to make the opportunity for  suburban living 
available  to  everyone  who  can  and  wants  to  come.  Individual 
suburbs  need  not  be  balanced  to  parallel  the  metropolitan  area 
population,  but  as  long  as  local  taxes  pay  for  most  municipal 
services,  communities  must  be  economically  diverse  enough  to 
preve.nt  the  creation  of  low-income  communities  which  cannot 
provide the array of public services  their residents need more ur-
gently  than  affluent  people.  Communities must  also  be  planned 
to provide  the  block homogeneity and community heterogeneity 
I described  in Chapter Eight, which allows for compatible neigh-
bors, yet makes room for  all  kinds of people in the community as 
a  whole-allowing diverse groups to live  together peacefully and 
still  have the social  contacts and institutions each needs for a  full 
life.  How such communities can  be achieved  is  the prime future 
challenge  for  professional  planners.  They  must  de-emphasize 
sterile  physical  planning  questions  and  deal  with  social  ques-
tions:  how to program diversity so as  to optimize both social com-
patibility and individual  freedom;  with economic ones;  how resi-
dents  and  government  can  pay  for  the  private  and  public  re-
quirements  of suburban  living;  and  with  political  ones:  how  to 
find ways of opening the suburbs to all comers. 

It  is  easy  to  propose  community  improvements  and  even 
utopian  communities  that  will  make  Levittown  seem  obsolete. 
Yet  I  should  like  to  emphasize  once  more  that  whatever  its  im-
perfections,  Levittown is  a  good  place  to live.  Consequently,  it is 
much less  important to plan for new or improved suburban com-
munities  than  to  make sure  that more people  are  able  to  live  in 
suburbs  like  those  now  being built. Specifically,  the most urgent 
priority  is  to  make  the  benefits  of suburban  living  available  to 
the  poor  and  nonwhite  families,  now  condemned  to  slum  ghet-
toes,  who want to give  their children  and themselves a  better life 
beyond the city limits. Building more Levittowns which are open 
to  these  families  would  be  preferable  to  schemes  for  building 
more diverse suburbs,  for  these may require higher house prices, 
which  would  restrict  suburban  living  to  the  white  middle  class 
for  yet  another  generation.  The  ideal  solution  is  more,  better, 
and  more  variegated  new  towns  and  suburbs,  but  the  first 
priority  in  the  years  to  come  is  more  such  communities for  the 
less affluent.

NOTES 

1.  There is  some evidence  that  the desire  for  the single-family  house 
is  international,  and  even  exists  in  countries which  cannot  afford 
to satisfy it.  I  found  it among Swedes  who  must live  in apartment 
complexes  (albeit  well-planned  ones);  it  is  reported  in  England 
by Orlans,  pp.  I06-1o7 and in  Ghana by Tetteh,  p.  25.

the  postwar increase  in  family formation  and  fertility.

THE  METHODS  OF 
THE  STUDY 

D 

D 

SINCE  SOCIOLOGICAL  FINDINGS  ARE  THE  JlESULT  OF  THE  JlESEARCH-
er's methods, I must describe my specific methods and their short-
comings in more detail  than was possible  in the Introduction,  in 
order to give a fair picture of the reliability,  validity, and limita-
tions of the data. 

THE MAIL QUESTIONNAIRE  SURVEY 

As  I  noted  in  the  Introduction,  I  had  to  resort  to  a  mail  ques-
tionnaire  in  order  to  obtain  data  from  the  Levittowners  before 
they moved to their new community. The mail questionnaire ran 
to  four  pages,  and  included a  covering letter  explaining why  it 
was  being sent out by the builder and why it was  to be returned 
to  the  University of Pennsylvania.  The letter said:  "We want to 
emphasize  this  is  a  University  research  project.  The Levitt firm 
sends  out our questionnaire in order to protect your anonymity, 
but  the  filled-out  questionnaire  comes  back  to  us  here."  It  was 
signed  by  the  Director  of  the  University's  Institute  for  Urban 
Studies,  since  I  did  not  want  to  be  identified  in  Levittown  as 
being connected with the survey. Although some people thought 
it  was  a  Levitt  promotion  or  inquiry,  most  accepted  it  at  face 
value. 

The questionnaire bore a code number based  on  the lot num-
ber of the house,  so  that reminders could  be sent  to people who 
•  435  • 

Appendix 
had  not returned  theirs.1  Although  this  created  some  suspicion 
that  I  knew  people's  names,  I  actually  did  not,  and  as  it 
turned  out,  the  reminders  were  quite  effective.  The  original 
questionnaire was  returned by 45  per cent of the buyers, and two 
reminders brought questionnaires  from  another  14  per cent and 
7  per cent  respectively,  thus giving a  total  return  rate  of 66  per 
cent.2  The  first  reminder was  sent by  the  Levitt firm  to  the  pre· 
vious  residence;  the  second  one  was  sent  by  the  Institute  for 
Urban Studies  to  the occupant at  his  Levittown  address,  usually 
about a month after people had moved in. 

Originally,  I  had  decided  to  ask  women  to  fill  out  the  ques-
tionnaires because  I  felt  they  had more time  to do so  than  their 
husbands, although they were asked  to check with their husbands 
on questions pertaining to  them.  Later, the choice of who would 
answer  was  left  up  to  the  respondent,  but  even  then,  women 
filled  it out more often than men.  In the final  sample of analyzed 
questionnaires, 6o per cent had been filled  out by women, 32  per 
cent  by  men,  and  8  P.er  cent  by  a  joint effort.  If women  had  a 
different  point  of  view  about  the  move  to  Levittown,  the  ques-
tionnaire data  undoubtedly  reflect a  female  bias,  but on  impor-
tant  questions,  I  asked  for  both  the  wife's  and  the  husband's 
point of view.  I  did not do any comparative analysis  to check for 
female  bias on other questions,  but most  questions  asked  for  in-
formation  rather  than  attitudes,  and  thus  are  not  especially 
affected  by  sex  differences.  Moreover,  because  of  the  inherent 
limitations  of  asking  people  questions  by  mail,  personal  ques-
tions  were  reduced  to  the  absolute  minimum.  Even  so,  only  11 
per cent of the  respondents  refused  to  give  their  income,  always 
the most difficult question for which to get answers. 

Since  I  could  not  afford  to  analyze  all  of  the  2100  returned 
questionnaires,  I  decided  to draw  a  sample.  From a  comparison 
of  some  demographic  data  collected  by  the  builder  on  all  pur-
chasers,  it was  apparent  that,  despite  the  high  return rate,  older 
people,  blue  collar  workers,  and  the  poorly  educated  were  not 
adequately represented among the respondents. 8  Consequently, I 
decided  to  draw  a  sample  based  on the  characteristics of the  en-
tire  population  rather  than  one  based  on  the  characteristics  of 
only the questionnaire respondents. 

Because  women  had  answered  the  questionnaire  more  often 
than  men,  and  because  I  felt  education  was  a  significant  deter-
minant  of  whether  the  questionnaire  would  be  answered,  I 

Appendix 

stratified the sample by women's education and by a variable that 
had some relation to age and income, the type of house bought in 
Levittown.  Interviewers  were  sent  to  a  15  per  cent  random 
sample of houses in the first  three neighborhoods, and data were 
obtained  on  women's  years  of  schooling.  This  provided  a  fre-
quency distribution  of  years  of schooling  by  house  type  in  each 
neighborhood.  On the oasis of this distribution,  I  then selected a 
sample  of  questionnaires. to  represent  30  per  cent  of  all  house-
holds  in  the  first  three neighborhoods, and obtained a  set of 952 
questionnaires  which  reflected  the  distribution  of  house  types 
and of women's years  of schooling  in each  of the neighborhoods. 
The final  sample still did not represent the population exactly. It 
could not correct directly for  age,  sex,  income, and men's  educa-
tion-or for  those  unknown  factors  that  make  one  Levittowner 
with  ten years  of schooling return his questionnaire and another 
not.  As  a  result,  the  findings  probably  still  underrepresent  the 
older and lower-income purchasers to some extent. 

mE INTERVIEW  STUDY 

As  I  indicated  in  the  Introduction,  I  thought  that  as  a  partici-
pant-observer I  could not conduct formal  interviews with people, 
because personal  questions are answered more easily if they come 
from  a  stranger  than  from  a  resident  of  the  community.  I  had 
enough funds  to interview a  10 per cent sample of the first  neigh-
borhood  (of  670  houses)  and  selected  a  random  one  stratified 
only  to  include  the  proper proportion  of  the  three  house  types. 
Half  the  respondents  were  to  be  men.  Of  the  65  households  in 
the  sample,  seven  could  not  be  found  at  home  after  five  call-
backs,  a  couple  refused,  and  in  some  instances,  wives  had  to  be 
interviewed because the men could not be reached. Of the remain-
ing 58  people, another  13  were  lost over  the two years before  the 
reinterview.  (Eight  had  moved,  one  was  never  home,  three  re-
fused,  and  one  had  become  senile.)  The  final  sample  thus  con-
sisted of 27 women and 18 men, each interviewed twice. The Phil-
adelphia sample  of  65  was  also  selected  from  the  first  neighbor-
hood,  to  make  sure  that  it would  include  only  people  who  had 
lived  in  Levittown  at  least  two years.  It was  originally  random, 
but a high refusal rate eventually resulted in a final  sample of 55· 
37 of them women, 18 men. 

In  both  samples,  the  refusals  came  primarily  from  men  and 

Appendix 

from  older,  poorer,  and  poorly  educated  purchasers.  Wherever 
possible, the data were analyzed by sex, age, occupation, and edu· 
cation  to  determine  how  these  affected  the  answers,  but  when  I 
report  figures  for  the  entire sample,  women,  and  younger,  more 
affiuent,  and  better·educated  people  are  somewhat  overrepre-
sented.4  Although  this  understates  the  extent  of  dissatisfaction 
and  worries  somewhat,  the  undersampling  of  men  (who  gen-
erally  reported  less  dissatisfaction)  overstates  it,  so  that  the  two 
may cancel  each  other out.  Moreover, since all  respondents came 
from  Levittown's  first  neighborhood,  and  later  purchasers  were 
of  higher socioeconomic level,  the  class  bias  in  the samples may 
thus  make  them  more  representative  of  Levittown  as  a  whole. 5 
Of course, the data are limited in that they apply only to  the first 
buyers  in  Levittown.  Although  later  buyers  might  react  differ-
ently on some questions,  I  doubt whether time  of arrival affected 
the amount and direction of  behavior change.  I  analyzed some of 
the data  to check for differences  between  those who had  lived  in 
Levittown  two years and those who had been there for three, and 
found none.  Moreover, an initial draft of the mail questionnaire, 
sent  to  the  first  300  purchasers  in  the  first  neighborhood,  had 
asked  whether  they  felt  themselves  to  be  pioneers,  but  so  few 
answered  this  question  positively  that  it  was  dropped  from  the 
final version. 

I  did  not  attempt  a  systematic  study  of why  so  many  former 
Philadelphians  refused  to  be  interviewed,  but many  of  the  men 
(who  did  most  of  the  refusing)  indicated  they  could  not  spare 
the  time  for  the  interview.  The  poor  transportation  between 
Levittown and Philadelphia made it difficult to  find  interviewers 
who could work evenings and weekends  to contact  the men,  and 
some had trouble in obtaining interviews. 

The more important questions  used  in  the interview  schedule 
have been included with the findings  in the text.  Most dealt with 
behavior and attitude change and typically asked people whether 
an  activity  had  increased  or  decreased  since  they  had  come  to 
Levittown.  Since the easiest response would have been to say "no 
change,"  I  left it out of the question,  requiring people  to volun-
teer it. Consequently, I  believe I  got a fair estimate of the change 
which  took  place,  or  rather,  of  the  change  people  thought  had 
taken  place.  The questions  were  carefully worded  to  make  sure 
that  no  answer  was  morally  or  psychologically  more  desirable 
than  any  other,  and  questions  about  negative  feelings,  such  as 

Appendix 

boredom,  were always  introduced with a  sentence  telling  people 
that boredom existed and  they were  not alone  in feeling  it.  Even 
so,  some  respondents  undoubtedly  emphasized  favorable  and 
underemphasized unfavorable change, although  they were  not at 
all  reluctant to criticize Levittown or to  talk about what worried 
them.  The  reinterview  schedule  repeated  the  questions  asked 
initially,  and  the  schedule  for  the  ex-Philadelphians  used  the 
same questions wherever relevant.  In some instances, respondents 
were  asked  to  report  on  behavior  and  attitude  change  for  their 
spouse  as  well,  in  the  hope  that  this  would  enlarge  the  sample. 
When I  analyzed  these  questions,  however,  I  found  that answers 
about  husbands  given  by wives  differed  considerably  from  those 
of  the  men  in  the  sample,  and  evidently  people  misperceived 
their spouses' feelings. 

The interview findings could not be tested for statistical signif-
icance  because  of the  size  and imperfect  randomness  of the  sam-
ples,  but the consistent patterns in many answers suggest that the 
findings  are  not a  result of chance and  that it is  possible  to carry 
out useful  quantitative analyses  with small  samples.  Even so,  the 
results should  be  considered  as  illustrative  evidence  rather  than 
scientific proof. 

THE PARTICIPANT-OBSERVATION STUDIES 

My  major  research  activities  as  a  participant-observer  included 
the following: 

1.  As  a  home  owner and a  resident,  I  lived  in  the community 
and  used  its  social  and  physical  facilities  like  everyone:  else.  I 
could  study  my  own  residence  in  the  community  and  observe 
that of other Levittowners. 

2.  As  a  resident of a specific  block,  I  could both act as  a  neigh-
bor and observe my own actions,  and also study my neighbors in 
their relationship to me and to other neighbors. 

3·  I  attended meetings of all  organizations about which I  knew 
and  at  which  I  could  be  present  without  being overly  visible.  I 
also  attended  almost  all  meetings  of  public  agencies  and  many 
of  the  meetings  of social,  civic,  political,  and  cultural  groups.  I 
could not attend meetings of women's clubs, and I  did not attend 
many  religious  functions  (except  in  the  Jewish  community), 
partly because of lack  of time,  partly because  people !:new  I  was 
Jewish  and  I  felt  I  would  be  intruding  in  a  Christian  religious

service  to no  useful  purpose.  I  did,  however,  attend  at  least  one 
service  in almost every church.  I  also  attended other public gath-
erings, such as community ceremonies, social  functions  put on  by 
organizations,  high  school  football  games,  and  local  art  shows, 
and even dropped in on a couple of teenage dances. 

4·  I  conducted  two  types  of informal  interviews.  I  talked with 
people about specific events,  for  example,  to find  out the reasons 
for  things that  had happened  at meetings  I  had  observed.  I  also 
interviewed regularly a  large  number of informants in all  major 
institutions  and  groups  in  the  community.  Like  a  newspaper-
man,  I  "made the  rounds," checking regularly with one or more 
informants  in  the  governmental  agencies,  the  voluntary  associa-
tions,  churches,  and  political  parties.  I  also  maintained  continu-
ing  contact  with  ministers,  doctors,  lawyers,  and  realtors,  the 
local  newspapermen,  Levitt  executives,  store managers,  residents 
in  different  parts  of  the  community,  and some  of  the  pre-Levit-
town  residents  as  well.  Keeping  in  contact  with  informants  and 
keeping abreast of events took most of my research time. 

5·  I  visited  with  people socially as  a  resident,  and since  Levit-
town was always an important topic of conversation, I  was able to 
collect data on these occasions. 

These activities  cast  me  in  three  types  of research  roles:  total 
researcher,  researcher-participant,  and  total  participant. 8  As  a 
total  researcher  I  observed  events  in  which  I  participated  mini-
mally or not at all,  for  example,  as  a  silent audience  member at 
public meetings.  As  a  researcher-participant,  I  participated in an 
event but as a  researcher rather than as a resident, for example, at 
most  social  gatherings.  As  a  total  participant,  I  acted  spontane-
ously as  a  friend  or neighbor  and  subsequently analyzed  the  ac-
tivities in which  I  had so  participated. The total  participant role 
is  the most honest one, and insofar as  I  was  myself affected by the 
events in which  I  was  participating,  the  most  productive one  for 
understanding a  social  situation.  It is  difficult  to carry out,  how-
ever, because it is  almost impossible  to lose consciousness of one's 
research  role,  and  if  one  does  lose  it,  one  also  becomes  less  ob-
servant  of  what  is  happening.  Most  of  my  data  I  gathered  as  a 
total  researcher  or  researcher-participant,  and  only  when  I  was 
involved in activities which  I  did not expect  to  produce relevant 
data would I relax into the total participant role. 

Roles develop not only out of the participant-observer's activi-
ties,  but also out of how people view him. When the researcher is 

Appendix 

•  441  • 

very  different  from  the  people  he  studies,  he  is  permanently an 
outsider, as  I was  in the Italian working class neighborhood I  had 
studied in Boston. 7  In Levittown, however,  I  had bought a  house 
like  everyone  else,  was  about  the  same  age  as  most  of my  neigh-
bors, and was not different ethnically or in terms of income.  Like 
them,  I  was  a  resident,  home  owner,  neighbor,  citizen,  and 
friend-as well  as  a  researcher,  which  resulted  in  some role con-
flicts,  partly  for  myself,  but  also  for  the  people  I  was  studying. 
One of  these  was  on  my own  block,  and  as  I  noted  in  the  In· 
traduction,  I  decided  from  the  start  not  to  act  like  a  researcher 
there.  I  kept my formal  research activities on the block to a mini· 
mum and tried to be a  total  participant as  often as  I  could.  Even 
so,  occasionally  my  neighbors  were  ambivalent  about  my  role. 
Once,  a  neighbor  invited  my  wife  and  me  to  a  meeting  of  her 
church fellowship to show us what the church was  like, but asked 
me  to  take  no  notes.  Away  from  my  own  block,  I  always  an-
nounced myself as a  researcher as  soon as I could, so as  to prevent 
uncertainty about my role.  As  I  indicated earlier,  people were as 
interested in my topic of study as  I  was,  and revealing myself as  a 
researcher did  not affect  their willingness  to  be studied.  Indeed, 
if I  had asked questions without explaining why I  was so curious, 
people  might  have  been  more  suspicious,  especially  if  the  ques-
tions  would  have  been  impertinent  when  asked  by  a  nonre-
searcher.  Also,  they  might  have  found  out  later  that  I  was  a  re-
searcher  and  thus  been  angry  with  me  the  next  time.  Unless 
there are pressing reasons to the contrary, complete openness and 
honesty is always the best policy. 

If I  aroused suspicion,  it was  about getting to know  too  much 
of  the  less  ethical  or  respectable  aspects  of community life.  I  re-
ported  before  that  some  politicians wondered  if my  book would 
be  like  Peyton  Place,  and  another  resident  asked  me  if  I  had 
found  any  of  Whyte's  "organization  men"  in  the  community. 
People  also  became  upset  at  my  presence  if  they  were  not  on 
their  best  behavior.  When  I  attended  private  political  meetings, 
I  would always  explain why  I  was  there and that I  would not be 
taking  notes  or  mentioning names  in  the  book.  And  I  recall  at-
tending  a  picnic  once,  in  which  a  community leader  showed  up 
in  a  rather  outlandish  pair  of  walking  shorts.  One  of  the  pick-
nickers  suggested  to  a  newspaper columnist  that  she  put  this  in 
her column.  She  indicated  that she  would not,  since  she  was  not 
working on Sundays, but pointed to me and said, "You have  to be 

Appendix 

careful  of him,  he  writes  everything  in  the  annals  of history."  I 
could only sputter that I was not working on Sundays either. 

Because  I  knew  all  the  community's  leaders,  I  aroused  some 
status  anxiety  among  my  neighbors.  I  was  occasionally  kidded 
about  having  a  front  seat  at  important  community  events  and 
was  once  asked  jokingly  whether I  could do  someone  a  favor  at 
city  hall.  (I  made  it  clear  that  I  had  absolutely  no  influence  in 
the community-as, indeed, I  did not.) To reduce their anxiety, I 
refrained from  establishing social  relations with community lead-
ers.  I  did not invite  them  to my house,  but then  I  was  not much 
of  a  party-giver  anyway,  and  the  few  parties  which  I  held  were 
limited to people on the block. Although my neighbors thought I 
had higher status in the community than they,  I  always felt that I 
had  less  than  the  leaders  whom  I  interviewed,  because  even  if  I 
had a  more prestigious job, I  was  not a  real  member of the com· 
munity. 

Actually,  much  of  the  role  conflict  developed  because  people 
wanted  me  to  take  nonresearch  roles.  I  mentioned  earlier  that 
because  of  my  planning  background,  I  was  asked  to  become  ac· 
tive  in  the  community,  and  was  once  offered  a  position  on  the 
Planning Board.  I  considered  taking it,  but felt it would conflict 
with  my  research  role  and  would  be  unfair  to  the  community, 
since  I  was not a  "total" resident.  Community leaders sometimes 
asked  me  to  listen  to  their  troubles,  making  me  take  a  quasi-
therapeutic role,  and  one  thanked me  once for  being a  "wailing 
wall."  More often, they used  the interview to think through their 
own  problems and  to  test out ideas.  Aware  that this  might  affect 
their  subsequent  activities,  I  made  as  few  comments as  possible, 
and when asked for advice,  I  gave  it only when it involved a  tech-
nical  point  or  a  matter  of  no  great  importance.  I  usually  ex· 
plained  that  as  a  researcher  I  could  not  participate  in  the  com-
munity  in  any  way,  and  that  if  I  gave  advice  to  one  person  or 
group,  I  would  have  to  do  so  for  all  others.  Most  people  under-
stood my neutral stance and did not insist. 

Political  leaders  sometimes  tried  to  get  me  to  reveal  findings. 
They knew  I  was  talking  to  their  opponents  and  sought  to  find 
out  what  I  had  learned.  I  was  also  asked  and  sometimes  even 
pressured to  take sides on community issues,  and again I  refused. 
People knew that I  was  often well informed and that my opinion 
might  thus  be  based  on  information  they  did  not  have.  Some 
were  annoyed  by  my  constant  neutrality  (and  evasiveness)  and 

Appendix 

tried  to  tease  or shame me  into taking a  stand.  At  election  time, 
members  of  both  parties  were  curious  about  how  I  would  vote. 
Although  I  did  have  preferences,  I  revealed  them  only  once, 
shortly after my fieldwork  began. As  a political  independent who 
generally voted Democratic, I  found myself uncomfortable in the 
all-Republican  and  often  quite  conservative  circles  of  the  pre-
Levittown  residents.  When  I  learned  that  a  Democratic  party 
had been organized and ran into a couple of the organizers,  I  was 
so  pleased  that  I  said  I  welcomed  the  event  and  would  like  to 
help  out.  Afterwards,  I  realized  that  I  had revealed  my political 
sympathies,  and  if  these  became  known,  I  would  no  longer get 
data  from  the  Republicans.  I  went  back  to  the  two  organizers, 
withdrew  the offer,  and asked  them  to  keep  the  entire conversa-
tion secret.  They  understood my dilemma,  honored  my request, 
and as  far  as  I  can  tell,  no one knew where  I  stood  politically as 
long as  I  lived  in  Levittown. 

This  event  was,  of  course,  a  performance  break  in  which  I 
dropped  my  role  as  researcher  and  acted  as  a  person.  Although 
the  strains  of  being  a  performer  often  tempted  me  to  other 
breaches,  I  was able  to  resist.  The temptation was  strongest with 
people  whose  values  I  shared,  particularly  the  cosmopolitans. 
Consequently, I  had to repress the urge to share my findings or to 
talk  about  how  they  could  be  more  effective  politically,  but  to 
have given in to the urge would have been unfair to other Levit-
towners.  Instead,  I  relied  on  my  wife  and  academic  colleagues 
outside  Levittown  for  the  pressing need  to  talk freely  about  my 
study  and  to  act  as  a  person  rather  than  a  participant-observer. 
The various  roles  I  took  and  the  various roles  in which  I  was 
seen  undoubtedly affected  the  kinds  of data  I was given, but it is 
difficult for me to judge how. Since the  participant-ob~erver must 
"sell" himself to get his data, how he comes across as a person and 
a  role  player may  influence  what  people  tell  him.  I  pointed  out 
in the Introduction that I  became a  bland and neutral person so 
as not to alienate people with different opinions, but this persona 
also  reduced  my  own  activity  in a  relationship  and  gave  the  in-
formant  more  opportunity  to  talk.  Indeed,  quite  often  I  pur-
posely  "played  dumb"  in  interviews,  giving  the  impression  I 
knew  less  than  I  actually  did,  so  that  people  would  give  me  a 
fuller description of their activities and of their attitudes. Once I 
had ·obtained such  a  description,  I  could ask  more  specific  ques-
tions,  even  about  contradictions  in  the  informant's  description. 

Appendix 

This  posture  was  not  entirely  artificial;  I  often  did  feel  dumb, 
and was always surprised how little I  knew about the community 
and how poor I  was at predicting future events. As a  result,  I  had 
good  reason  for  being  humble  (and  neutral)  with  informants. 
This  is  only  one  way  of  relating  to  informants,  and  I  some-
times thought that if I  took a  more active role  in  the relationship 
and voiced  my own  opinions,  particularly deviant ones,  I  would 
learn  something  I  would  not  find  out  in  polite  conversation.  In 
the  end,  I  decided  that getting  into an  argument  might  alienate 
me from  people I  wanted to talk with in the future.  Moreover, as 
a  person,  I  was  more comfortable in an unassertive role,  and act-
ing  otherwise  would  only  have  increased  the  strain  of  being  a 
participant-observer.  Yet  perhaps  the  most  important  factor  in 
the  researcher-informant  relationship  is  status,  and  a  researcher 
of  higher  or  lower  status  than  his  informant  obtains  different 
data  than  a  researcher  who  is  felt  to  be of  equal  status.  As  I  in-
dicated,  I  always  sought  to  reduce  status  discrepancies  and  to 
treat  my data sources  as  equal--or as  superior,  because  they had 
information I did not have. 

The extent to which my own values affected my findings is also 
difficult  to judge.  Coming to Levittown with  the  hypothesis  that 
the  suburban  critics  were  wrong may  have  blinded  me  to  some 
contradictory data,  but it also made me feel  more sympathetic to 
the  Levittowners  and  more  receptive  to  how  they  thought  and 
felt.  So  did  my  belief  in  pluralism  and  relativism.  Yet  none  of 
these  values  caused  me  to  overidentify  with  my  sources  of data. 
Overidentification  is  a  major  problem  for  the  participant-ob-
server,  which  may create  such  strong attachments  to  the  popula-
tion  he  studies  that  he  fails  to see  undesirable  elements  in  their 
behavior. 8  The West  Enders  I  lived  with  in  my  previous  study 
were  poorer  than  I  and  were  facing  destruction  of  their  neigh-
borhood  by  an  urban  renewal  project  which  would  eventually 
replace  them  with  high-income  tenants.  They  were  underdogs, 
and I  identified with  them as  such. 9  The Levittowners were nei-
ther  poor  nor  threatened,  and  I  had  no  reason  to  feel  sorry  for 
them. 

I  probably identified most with some of the working class resi-
dents  who  had  financial  and  other  problems  or  were  struggling 
against  the  lower  middle  class  climate  of the  community,  partly 
because  they  resembled  West  Enders  I  had  liked,  partly because 
they were  underdogs,  and  partly  because  I  was  not always  happy 

Appendix 

with the political conservatism and moral  restrictiveness of some 
lower  middle  class  Levittowners.  I  did  not like  all  the  working 
class  people  I  met,  however,  for  some  were  openly  anti-intellec-
tual, opposed to  racial  integration,  narrowly patriotic and hawk-
ish about the "H" bomb, and politically no more liberal than  the 
lower middle  class.  And  I  was  also  uncomfortable  with some  of 
the  more  mobile  working class  people  who  were  trying  hard  to 
shed i:he  informality and skepticism that prevails in working class 
culture.  But I  was  more uncomfortable  with  lower  middle class 
people who  had graduated from  college  yet  had  retained  the  so· 
cial  and political conservatism of less  educated people.  Occasion-
ally,  I  had  to  remind  myself  that  I  was  judging  them  from  my 
own  class  position  as  a  university  professor  and  from  my  own 
preference  for  cosmopolitanism  and  was  lapsing  into  the  rejec-
tion of middle class culture that is  endemic to intellectuals. As  I 
got  to  know  people  better,  to  understand  their ways,  and  to  see 
how  these  related to  their own background, much of my discom-
fort  and disapproval  disappeared.  Since  most  Levittowners  were 
not status-seekers or anxious conformists,  it was easy to like them 
even  when  I  disagreed  with  their  ideas.  Indeed,  I  was  perhaps 
most critical of the cosmopolitans, because they felt  themselves to 
be liberals and intellectuals, but were not quite ready to practice 
what  they  preached  and  were  particularly  intolerant  of  their 
lower-status  neighbors.  Agreeing with  them about some  issues,  I 
was  ready  to  be  more  critical  of  them  when  I  disagreed.  I  as-
sumed  (perhaps  wrongly)  that  well-educated  people  should  and 
could be more pluralistic and less  intent on defending their own 
class  interests than others. 

The  values  (and  feelings)  which  most  affected  my  fieldwork 
concerned  the  deceptions  required  to  be  a  participant-observer. 
They generated  the  guilt and anxiety  I  described  in  the  Intro-
duction, and sometimes made me feel  I  was  using people for  my 
own  purposes.  Although  I  told  people  I  was  a  researcher at  the 
start,  I  realized  that  they  soon  forgot  this,  so  that  they  did  not 
really know how much they were being observed;  and among my 
immediate  neighbors,  I  was  collecting data  when  I  appeared  to 
act as  a resident. This problem is endemic to p~rticipant-observa­
tion, and I cannot find a way of eliminating it. If the researcher is 
completely  honest  with  people about his  activities,  they  will  try 
to  hide  actions  and  attitudes  they  consider  undesirable,  and  so 
will be dishonest. Consequently, the researcher must be dishonest 

Appendix 
to  get  honest  data.l 0  If this  leads  to  guilt  feelings,  it  can  affect 
findings,  for  it  may  discourage  him  from  being  critical  of  the 
people  he  has  deceived  and  used.  Fortunately,  these  feelings  de-
crease  once  fieldwork  is  over,  and  their  potential  effect  on  the 
findings can be dealt with during the analysis and writing period. 
They never disappear entirely, however, and one must either live 
with them or stop doing research. 

The researcher can  protect his informants by making sure that 
the data  he gathers  will  not  be  used  against  them.  He  need not 
mention  names,  and  in  any case,  his  publication  usually  appears 
years  after  the  research,  making  it  unlikely  that  the  data  can  be 
used against anyone.  Even if a  researcher decided that the behav-
ior of  those  he  studied was  so  unjust  that  he  felt  impelled  to  re-
veal  it,  he  would  still  withhold  names.  Such  problems  aside,  the 
researcher acts on  the faith  that the advantages of his research  to 
the  people  studied  will  outweigh  the  possible  disadvantages  of 
their  being  described  in  a  published  report,  or  the  more  subtle 
disadvantages of having been deceived by the researcher. 

Still,  the  main  shortcomings  (and  biases)  of  participant-obser-
vation result less  from  the researcher's roles and values than from 
the structure of the community he is  studying.  If the community 
is  suspicious  of outsiders,  he will  have difficulty  in gaining entry 
and  in  observing a  representative sample of the  population.  In a 
new  town,  conflict  between  the  builder  and  his  purchasers  may 
force  him to become identified with one,  thus losing rapport with 
the  other.l 1  Neither  problem  existed  in  Levittown.  Because  the 
community  was  new,  its  social  structure  open,  and  its  residents 
interested  in a  history of the community building process,  I  had 
no  trouble  in  gaining  cooperation  or  access  (except  at  caucuses 
and  some  private  political  meetings).  Community  boosters  are, 
of course,  the  most  helpful  (if  not always  the  most  accurate)  in-
formants,l2  but once I got to know them and had other sources of 
information about their groups,  they were usually willing to  talk 
about organizational conflict as  well.  But even  the less  enthusias-
tic  Levittowners  were  willing  to  help  me,  partly  because  they 
could  use  me  to  get  their  gripes  off  their  chest.,  My  contacts 
with  the  Levitt  organization  were  too  infrequent  and  the  pur-
chasers'  dissatisfaction  with  the  finn  too  rare  to  cause  any  prob-
lems,  although  in  this  instance as  in  many others,  being a  home-
owner with  the same  house-and-lawn  problems as  other residents 

Appendix

made it much easier for me to obtain rapport with the Levittown-
ers  than  for  an  outside  observer. 

Consequently,  I  did  not  have  to  worry  about  talking  with  a 
representative sample.  I  kept no record of how many people I  in-
terviewed  informally  during  the  three  years  of  fieldwork,  but  I 
maintained  frequent  contact  with  at  least  fifty  to  seventy-five, 
and  probably  talked  altogether  with  four  or  five  hundred-at 
least  one  member  from  about  15  percent  of  the  families  in  the 
first  three neighborhoods.  Moreover, since  I  was not doing a gen-
eral community study,  but was usually researching specific  topics, 
the  people  to  whom  I  talked  were  defined  by  the  topic  rather 
than  by my ability to  obtain access  and rapport.  Thus,  there was 
less opportunity for  the  bias  that develops  unintentionally when 
a researcher talks to more  people of his own class and educational 
level.  Even  so,  in my general  participant-observation activities,  I 
probably  talked  with  proportionately  more  middle  class  people 
than  working class  ones, and with  more  upper  middle class  ones 
than lower middle class ones.  Fortunately, however, I  had consid-
erable contact with working class  Levittowners who lived on my 
own block. 

Actually,  the  most  difficult  research  problem  was  untangling 
political  events.  I  could  not  always  get  honest  responses  from 
some  politicians;  even  when  I  did,  they saw  things so  much from 
their own perspective that I was, always faced with the problem of 
reconciling conflicting accounts.  The  difficulty  was  not so  much 
in finding out what  happened as why.  Political strategies are very 
complex even  in a  small community,  the  motivations  that create 
these  strategies  are  often  unfathomable,  and  politicians  are  not 
always  willing  (or  able)  to  reveal  their  motives  and  goals.  One 
solution is  to talk  to their opponents, ask  them to explain  an ac-
tion,  and  then confront  the original  actor with  this explanation. 
Usually  this  produces  denials,  but  sometimes  it  results  in  more 
detailed  explanations  than  would  otherwise  be  given,  and  these 
can then be checked out with others. Another solution is  to find a 
trustworthy  person  who  is  marginal  to  the  group  being  studied 
and  depend  on  him  for  final  verification.  Such  people  are  rare, 
however,  for  if one is  involved  in  politics it is  difficult to remain 
marginal.  I  was  fortunate  in  being able  to  find  a  couple  of mar-
ginal  people,  as  well  as  a  local  newspaperman  who  was  "in  the 
know"  but  sufficiently  detached  from  the  political  process  to 

Appendix 

serve  as  an  informant.  When  these  sources  were  not available,  I 
had  to  rely  on  the  information  given  me  by  people  whom  I 
trusted,  and  while  this  may  have  introduced some  bias  into  the 
data,  because  I  was  more likely  to  trust people I  liked and  those 
of my  own  educational  background,  I  had  no  other alternative. 
Sometimes,  what  really  happens  in  politics  is  virtually  unknow-
able to an outsider, and the only solution is  for  the researcher to 
become a participant and keep notes in the process. 

In one sense,  the mystery  of  politics  is  deceptive,  however,  for 
the  unknowable  is  restricted  to  motives  and  to  illegal  or  dis-
approved activities, neither of which is as important as one thinks 
they are while one is doing fieldwork.  Illegal and disapproved ac-
tivities usually play only a  minor role in the  politics of a  middle 
class  community.  The need  to  know about  them stems  from  the 
uncertainty of the  political  process,  which breeds  the desire  (and 
the curiosity)  to remain up to date and well  informed, and from 
the  rumors  about  corruption,  graft,  and  deals  that  come  up  all 
the time and have to be checked out., Curiosity about motivations 
comes from  the same uncertainty, but if the researcher is  patient, 
he  will  usually  find  that  later  actions  by  politicians  indicate 
which motives were at play in earlier ones. 

ANALyziNG  THE  DATA 

Although I had hoped to analyze the mail questionnaire data and 
the first  interview with  the random sample before getting deeply 
involved  in  the  participant-observation  and  before  drafting  the 
second  interview  schedule,  the rapid  pace  at  which  the  commu-
nity developed and the slow  pace at which data must be analyzed 
when funds  for research assistance are lacking made this impossi-
ble.  I  was able to do some  preliminary analysis of early question-
naire data with the help of students, and I  knew  how  the first  in-
terview was answered before I  made up the second schedule,  but 
most  of  the data  were  analyzed  after  the conclusion  of  the  field-
work. 

The mail questionnaire data were tabulated by IBM machines, 
but  the  interview  data  I  coded,  tabulated  and  analyzed  myself. 
Although  this  took  considerable  time,  it also  made  me  quite fa-
miliar  with  the  contents  of  each  interview,  and  with  the  inter-
viewees  as  people-at  least,  to  the  extent  that  they  described 
themselves  by  their  answers--making  it  methodologically  and

psychologically safer to attempt a  quantitative analysis of a  small 
sample. 

The participant-observation data were originally recorded in a 
diary,  but as  soon  as  I  had  translated  my  initial  study questions 
into a set of topics, I  gave  up the diary, and put my field  notes on 
5 X 8 sheets,  one  per  topic.  A  single meeting or  interview  often 
produced  data  on  half  a  dozen  topics,  and  recording  them  by 
topic  was  a  real  time-saver  in  the  analysis,  for  I  did  not  have  to 
take  apart  or  index  the  diary  to  synthesize  data  on  each  topic. 
Eventually, I  had many thousands of sheets, all filed  by topic, and 
I  drew my findings from an intensive and oft repeated rdding of 
them. I  made no real  attempt to integrate the findings reached by 
the  three  different  methods,  except when  I  had  developed  inter-
view questions  to  test an  idea learned in  participant-observation . 
.!\.fore  such  integration would have been desirable, but I  had such 
vast amounts of data that it took me a long time even  to organize 
them into a single narrative. 

The findings  presented here have all  the faults  of the methods 
by which  they were reached.  Often,  the  resulting generalizations 
are  examples  of  what  Merton  calls  "post  factum  sociological  in-
terpretation";  they  have  been  developed  after  the  observations 
were  made  and  are  not  tests  of  prior  hypotheses. 13  I  therefore 
conclude  with  the  same  remarks  with  which  I  ended my  earlier 
book: 

This, then,  is  not a scientific study, for it does not provide 
what  Merton  has  called  compelling evidence  for  a  series  of 
hypotheses.  It  is,  rather,  an  attempt  by  a  trained.  social 
scientist  to  describe  and  explain  the  behavior  of  a  large 
number of people,  using his methodological and theoretical 
training  to  sift  the  observations,  and  to  report  only  those 
generalizations which are justified by the data.  The validity 
of my findings  thus rests  ultimately on my judgments about 
the  data,  and  of  course  on  my  theoretical  and  personal 
biases in deciding what to study, what to see,  what to ignore 
and  how  to  analyze  the  products.  Properly  speaking,  the 
study is a  reconnaissance, an exploration of a community to 
provide  an  overview,  guided  by  the  canons  of  sociological 
theory and method,  but not attempting to offer documenta-
tion for all  the findings.  I do not mean to cast doubt on the 
conclusions  I  reached  (I  stand  behind  them  all)  or  on  the 
methods I  used.  Participant-observation  is  the only method 
I  know  that  enables  the  researcher  to get close  to  the  real-

ities of social  life.  Its deficiencies  in  producing quantitative 
data  are  more  than  made  up  by  its  ability  to  minimize  the 
distance  between  the  researcher  and  his  subject  of  study. 14 

The  mail  questionnaires  and  interviews  provided  more  system-
atically  collected data,  and  are  thus  more  scientific  in one sense, 
although less  so  in another,  for  they can report only what people 
say they do and feel,  and not what a  researcher has seen them say, 
do, and feel.
